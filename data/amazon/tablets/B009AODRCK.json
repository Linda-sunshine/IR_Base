It does however run just fine. I do not have any lag bringing up settings or changing pages on either of the two we purchased. I got them for our kids to play with and wanted to get the google play accounts and wireless set up prior to them opening on Christmas morning. I find myself playing with these things more than I should... Everything I have set up on both of them has been smooth. Youtube app works great and the videos play back smooth and studder free. This was my biggest worry when ordering. The screen is really only viewable when looking dead on, but its only 7 inches, so you probably wont be sharing the view much on it anyway. The batteries did need charged for 6 hours prior to using and one of them was stuck in a battery screen flashing loop while charging the first time, but they work fine now. You have to hold the power button down for longer than any other tablet I have had to turn it on also. Wonder how many people dont figure that out..... Also, they have a poor quality screen protector factory applied. There are no tabs to peel it off with and it is applied very well with no bubbles underneath. This would be a plus but feels very rough on your fingers and blurs the screen. I was ready to not like the screen at all until I realized this was just a stick on cover and peeled it off. Glass underneath is great and it improved the touch accuracy. Durability is the only unknown and if they die in the first year of ownership, I will update this review...", "Title": "I Got 2 of them!", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jessica P.", "ReviewID": "R3ALMDBPL1ISUF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I went out on a limb and ordered this for my son for Christmas hoping that the good reviews would win out.

But after 2 months of low use, it's dead and won't even start up past the Android logo.edited 1/24/13 and changed from 1 star to 4.  This tablet has a bit of a quirk in it that when it's charging from the USB cable (I lost the original power plug that came with it, but have tons of USB ones), it doesn't power up (from being completely off) past the Android logo.  Startup must happen when the USB cable is unplugged.

Awesome!!!!So far I have been able to installed my Kindle App and Nook for reading. My word processor.Yes, I can see and watch movies, I am able to even write on my weekly blog!!!! This was a big plus.It arrived today, I haven't been able to put it down. Setup was easy, not a scratch or dent on it, very solid tablet!It wasn't even slow!I had purchased a SD Card at the local store and it  work. I am waiting for my keyboard which it should be coming in a couple of days and I will see if it works. I did notice, the sound was low, but I haven't use my earphones yet.For me it is working perfect. I encourage anyone interested to buy it.I will give you an update as how its working for me again.*****UPDATE******The speakers work best with earplug....The sound is excellent!The only complaint....it seems I have developed by majic a thin green line when I used the Kindle app and it wont go away.Nothing to discourage me yet....What has worried me, had to installed 3 times the amazon app becuase it stop working. But It could be me, that did something wrong. Still a winner for me.*****UPDATE 01/09/2013*****Well, the thin lines on the screen have not gone away and now I have seven in all. I did contacted the seller, they were very fast in their respond and I am shipping my tablet back. I do want to get another one and hope this one won't have the same problem. I do like this tablet and I want to keep it, just can't live with this horizontal lines.*****UPDATE 01/11/2013*****With great pain, I sent my tablet back to the seller for service. The thin line were getting too much for me. I miss my tablet a lot. I am anxious waiting for the results and getting my tablet back or a replacement. If this doesn't go well. Then I will buy my next choice which is the Samsung Tablet. Will let you know, the final outcome.*****UPDATE 01/17/2013*****FINAL UPDATE\"Sadly to say am dead in the water.\" Regardless this tablet was great. The solutions offer by Customer Service @ BrainyDeal were totally non satisfactory. Order this item on Dec. 29th...got it the 3rd of January by the 7th had to returned it. BrainyDeal told me they didn't have this item on stock so they can't replace it now...funny that they are still taking orders as we speak.I made more suggestion that they offer me. Now its the 17th and no tablet. The tablet is good.... just don't get it from them.
