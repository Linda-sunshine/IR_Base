I have really enjoyed this little guy. First of all the size is perfect if you are looking for a tab that you can take with you but the 7\" (diaginal)screen is large enough to make games,webpages,and things easy to see compared to my cell phone even though my phone has the largest screen out there right now the Dell tab is much better as far as size. If you are reading a lot of reviews you will see that short battery life is a major complaint with this tablet. Well I went to the android market (on my tablet of course) and found a couple of battery managing apps that are designed to extend the life of your android devices battery which I have used on all my android smart phones as well and I would have to say they are helping considerably and believe me I am no computer wizz or anything like that just takes a little common sense. I used my Dell Streak tablet last night for about three and a half to four hours straight playing games and I went to bed and left my tablet on, when I woke up this morning I looked to see how much battery I had left thinking it had probably \"died\" during the night but much to my suprise it had maintained and had 16% battery life left and had been on at for 14 hours and 45 minutes at that point so I would say not to shabby. In case you are wondering which app I got from the Android market it was (2x Battery) and it seems to have made a huge difference in the battery life if I still have battery left after 14 hours. Well to get to some other points concerning the Dell Streak tablet, the tablet runs smooth and fast and I have had no problem finding wifi and getting connected,the screen is very responsive to the touch and the tablet feels good in your hands,the weight of it is very manageable,as I mentioned before I have been playing driving games on it and use the tablet to steer (like a steering wheel)and so im holding the tablet up in the air in front of me and I have not once thought about the weight of the tablet at all. The graphics are very acceptable to me although if you want to spend more money you would probably notice some difference in clairity with a more expensive tablet but I am very satisfied with the picture for what I paid,and I am picky about everything,just ask my friends, okay well never mind about the friend thing but seriously all in all I am very happy with my purchase this is a well built devise in my openion and I plan to enjoy it for a long time to come. I hope this review has been helpfull and good luck in your search for a new tablet.", "Title": "Awesome android tablet", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Author": "ChrisBronco", "ReviewID": "R3UJAYJFMXHBYX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For your sake, do NOT buy the Dell Streak 7.  I made the mistake of buying two (2) of them on Black Friday from Best Buy for $159.99 each  Both of them are constantly locking up for no reason.  There is a reason Dell announced they were discontinuing this item a week after I bought it.....they have major issues.  I feel so strongly about this product that I am writing only my second review in my entire life b/c I want people to know how bad it is.  Buy something else.  Save your money.  Good Luck", "Title": "Do NOT buy a Dell Streak 7", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "henry'sapproved", "ReviewID": "R2FK5C5NPHU64Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a tablet for a while, researching different ones from 5in - 10in tablets.  I purchased this not from Amazon but from another site.  I think Price and the size is what attracted me to this item.  Price is half the price for regular 10in tablets and the 7in screen is actually pretty big and don't have any issue with surfing the web or playing games or viewing videos.Mobility: 4.5/5 It is very portable.  I pretty much take it everywhere I go.Camera: 2.5/5 It does have two cameras but either of them work too well.  Images are fuzzy and grainy especially @ indoor.  I think my HTC incredible takes better pictures.Speed: 4/5 it is a fast little sucker.  It takes about 10-15secs to boot.  I notice that it had some issue with play full HD movies on SD/class10 where it was bit choppy but movies meant for its screen resolution plays just fine.User friendly: 4/5  It is very easy to navigate around this tablet.  If you are an android user, you are going to be just fine.  Even if you are not, I don't think you will have any issue.  My little kid after couple days able to figure it out.Battery life: 3/5 It It lasts about a day for intermittent usages of web surfing and video watching.Overall Value: 4/5  If you need something portable with decent price, I think this will work out very well for you.Thanks for reading my review!", "Title": "Neat little tablet", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Author": "esanta \"esanta\"", "ReviewID": "RPDA7PRZT242T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Dell Streak 7 is essentially the 7\" version of the popular Dell Streak 5.Unfortunately, Dell chose to stay with the low 800x480 resolution of the smaller model, and they also picked a pretty lousy screen with a fairly small viewing angle range. The contrast changes so sharply with the angle of vision that it is unpleasant to use in portrait mode because you don't see the same things with both eyes! The problem is not as pronounced when using the device in landscape mode.The Streak features traditional Android hardware buttons: power and volume +/- at the top are physical push buttons; back, menu and home are capacitive backlit buttons on the right bezel. Sound is provided via two stereo speakers on either side. There is a standard headphone jack on the left, and on the right side you will find a full size SD card slot and a full size SIM card slot (for the 4G model) behind a little plastic door.Microphone and front facing camera are located at the top of the screen, and a rear facing 5MP camera with flash is in the back.Finally, the bottom of the case features a proprietary connector that can be used with the optional Dell docking station or the supplied USB cable and charger.Wireless connectivity is pretty standard with WiFi (802.11n), 4G (for the T-Mobile 4G model), and Bluetooth. The Streak has no problems connecting to my home and work WiFi networks and switches effortlessly. I'm not so impressed with T-Mobile's 4G networking offer. 4G is spotty to the point of being useless (I'm in the San Francisco south bay) and not competitive at $50 for a paltry 2.5GB of bandwidth per month. On the positive side, it's pay as you go and the Streak comes pre-configured with WiFi tethering software, so if you live in an area of good coverage it would be a worthy alternative to a 4G access point.Dell configures the Streak with its own desktop variation called Dell Stage. I was surprised to find it a very capable replacement to the standard Android desktop. Unlike the catastrophic desktop replacement picked by Viewsonic for its ill-fated gTablet, it doesn't try to do too much or smother the user in glacially slow UI goodness. It works quite nicely without getting in the way, kudos for that.PROS----* Ships with WiFi tethering software pre-installed, presumably with T-Mobile's blessing* Full size SD card port instead of the microSD port found on most Android devices* Flash for rear facing camera (don't expect miracles)* Front and rear-facing cameras* Built-in stereo speakers, decent sound (for such a small device)* backlit bezel buttons* Dell Stage is well thought out and pleasant* Relatively low priceCONS----* Proprietary connector. If you lose or break the cable that came with it, you won't be able to charge the Streak* Lousy screen. Not as lousy as the Viewsonic gTablet's, but almost. The 800x480 resolution just won't cut it for a 7\" tablet sold in 2011, when the inexpensive and capable Barnes & Noble Nook Color comes with a gorgeous 1024x600 screen.* Poor battery life. I have not been able to get more than 6 hours out of it no matter what I do. Worse, even when configured for maximum power savings a fully charged battery gets depleted after a mere 2 days in stand by. That is just unacceptable.* Poor performance. I don't know why, but the Streak feels sluggish. A friend of mine who's an Android geek confirmed it to me and was surprised to learn that it was using a Tegra 2. It's not responsive like you would expect from a high end processor, especially considering it has comparatively few pixels to push around.* Compatibility issues: I own a Nook Color and a gTablet; both run Monsoon's Vulkano app without problems. I was unable to stream any video content (from the Vulkano) on the Streak. It streamed just fine from other sources (HBO GO, for instance)* Fairly heavy and thick.* Uncompetitive data plans from T-Mobile (for the T-Mobile version)CONCLUSION----------In my opinion, the Streak 7 is marred by many flaws, two of them fatal: poor battery life (particularly in stand-by) and poor screen quality. In the crowded Android tablet market, you can find much better devices for the same price.I expected better from Dell, and I honestly cannot recommend this product.", "Title": "Back to the drawing board.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Author": "L. Zhang \"lz\"", "ReviewID": "R3NMPHDKZYRDQB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product in august, it cant be charged now.That means it is a garbage if no power available. The charger and charging port are the worst design I ever saw.", "Title": "Terrible Product", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Author": "Fredrik Nyman", "ReviewID": "RO04JTHUKME32", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up one of these the other day, when unnamed-office-chain emailed me (and everyone else in the US, apparently) a \"$100 discount on any tablet\" offer I couldn't refuse.Before I bought the tablet, I had done some research, knew its weaknesses, and knew that those weaknesses weren't going to be a big problem for me.  So far I am quite happy with my purchase.So let me start out by confirming the tablet's weaknesses.  Compared to the iPad2 and the best Android tablets: the battery lifetime is poor, the screen is poor, the camera is poor, and it is running an obsolete version of Android (Froyo, 2.2.2).If these weaknesses are a problem for you, forget the Streak 7 and get a different tablet.For me, they weren't really issues.  I'll be using the tablet for reading email and e-books, browsing the web, occasional games and occasional geocaching.  It will not be my primary device for anything except maybe reading e-books, so its limitations just don't matter much to me.And now that we have gotten these limitations out of the way, let's talk about what is good about it: at $200, it is a great value.  Performance is quite good thanks to its dual-core 1GHz processor, and with 16GB internal storage and an available slot for a (up to 32GB) SDHC card, it has plenty of storage.  The device can easily be rooted if you want to live on the edge and install a not-provided-by-Dell version of Android.  If you prefer to stay supported, Dell is rumored to be releasing Honeycomb in August.", "Title": "If you can live with its limitations, it is a great deal.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Author": "Sheri Fogarty", "ReviewID": "RK7JBOY7WAADZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who has never used a touchscreen before - or an android device - it took me a little while to figure out how they work. My teenager tried to show me but he moved so quickly, I could barely see what he was doing. LOLOnce I got it figured out, this was a really fun tablet. It's small - around the size of my Kindle 2 - and android based. There are a lot of free aps and there is a lot you can use it for, from reading books to watching movies, playing games or checking your email. I have the wireless version and it was not difficult to set up.Some of the aps worked better then others. I was looking forward to using the Zinio ap, to read digital copies of a magazine I subscribe to, but every time I launched it I got a error message and could not get it to work. That was the only ap I had a problem with. Kindle for Android worked great, I have a Amazon Kindle which I love and don't usually like to read on backlit devices but I found I was comfortable reading on the Dell. I watched some movies, and YouTube videos and was really happy with the quality. There's also a headset so it would be great for during travel or when you didn't want to disturb your partner.  The video chat worked great and there are many, many games to choose from. I played a free version of one of my favorites, Bejeweled and it worked well.The mail worked pretty well for me. It's a little hard to see your whole mailbox, if you have a lot of email as the screen is small and I didn't love typing on the onscreen keyboard. If I wanted to do a lot of typing I would look into an external keyboard. I took this on a weekend trip, instead of my laptop and it was perfect. I checked email, checked Facebook, looked up a restaurant on Yelp, got directions. The Dell is light, easy to take along and was great for whatever I needed during the trip. It has 16 GB of internal memory and you can add more with an SD card.I bought a Kindle 2 caseBelkin Neoprene Kindle Case (Fits 6\" Display, 2nd Generation Kindle) on clearance and it works great for this . The case is a little big, but it gave me room for the booklet and the headset as well.All in all a fun tablet, in a nice portable size. Recommended!", "Title": "A Fun Tablet", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RKPJ8S7CVBU93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this back in April, this year.  It arrived in good condition, and I loved it from the start.  It just worked.Having been an early-adopter of Android, (G1 from T-mobile nearly 2 years ago) I was quite familiar with how to work the Streak.The Streak's dual-core made it all lively and responsive.  It is a shame about all the bloat-ware, though-- I wish I could simply delete the unwanted junk-ware Dell loaded me up with, but short of rooting?  You have to live with it, I suppose.The dell stage was amusing for about 2 days, then all of them got deleted-- I do not use a single one of Dell's \"stage widgets\".  Nor do I use the \"dell sync\"-- it is a useless, bandwidth-hogging unwanted thing.  But that's about the only thing I do not like...I would've given this 5 stars.But.  Last Friday, I took my Streak to lunch, as usual, and tried to open my E-book (Kindle-app) and enjoy my lunch.  No joy:  \"force-shut-down, low battery\"What?  The battery icon shows 100%!  After a Streak-less lunch, I put it on the charger-- only then would it turn on.  But, now I was faced with an endless series of \"force-close\" in the software, mostly the pre-installed junk.  And the battery reads 100%, and the green \"full charge\" light is on... what gives?Unplugging the charger gave me 1-2 minutes, all the while showing 100% charge. During that time, any attempted access to either SD card resulted in \"force-close\" of the affected software.  After 1-2 minutes, a too-quick force-shut down, low battery message is barely visible before black screen.Okay.  Leave it on the charger a couple of hours.  Now, it boots up, but any access to either SD card results in \"force-close\", and it refuses to acknowledge anything on either card as having been installed.Finally, I was forced to factory-reset-- wiping everything.  This was after calling Dell tech-support-- they answered quickly enough, but there was a fairly severe communication barrier, unfortunately.  In spite of that, the people were supremely polite and did try their best (I think) to help.This cured the force-close issues (as far as I could tell), but the battery issue remained.  Leaving on the charger all night apparently trickle-charged it enough, that it would boot up without the charger on.  Over the weekend, I left it off the charger, but at factory-reset condition, and it happily reported 14 hours since being plugged in, 100% charge........ clearly, I had either invented a perpetual-motion machine, or the battery was toast.Today, I got the return-box from Dell.  What a nightmare >that< turned out to be-- no instructions on what to do vis a vis FedEx, just a barely legible shipping payment invoice, only 1/2 filled out.  A trip to FedEx was worse-- the counter people were quite clueless what to do with it.  They even insisted I fill out some sort of \"commercial shipping customs report\", of which I had no idea what to put, and neither did the clueless peons at FedEx.  After much time-wasted, they finally concluded the pre-filled out form from Dell was invalid, wrong ID or some such excuse.A call back to Dell made things worse-- they then e-mailed me a printable label that would've just returned it for partial credit!  (I did not learn that, until I returned home).  Yet another call to Dell, and ... ?We'll see.  They are always quite helpful over at Dell, and unctuously polite-- but polite-wrongness is still wrong.  They are sending (how? E-mail? Not clear) me yet another label, this time supposed to be the repair center in... Mexico, of all things.So.  4 stars-- minus one for the SNAFU vis a vis getting this repaired.Meanwhile, I'm >still< out $300, and no Streak to show for it, and it hasn't even shipped yet!... we shall see what we shall see.*****************************Edit:  not quite 24 hours, and still no e-mail with the shipping label.So far, I'm out my nearly $400, and I haven't had the use of my Streak since last Friday on June 17.  What's worse?  My busted Streak is still sitting on my coffee table, >>not<< shipped for repair ...  If I could take-away a star, I would.*****************************Edit:  6 days since my first call, and I >>still<< have not mailed this busted, no-battery Streak to get it fixed... I'd remove yet another star.  They say 14 or more \"business days\" (translation: two of the regular days most of us have to live with) before I'll get it back--if then.*****************************Edit:  Friday morning, no shipping label in my inbox.  Yet another call to Dell tech \"support\".  And the guy had the stones to ask for yet >another< 24 hours to get this label to me!  Attempts to get to a manager resulted in a disconnected call.  Call back, skip the peon, and asked for manager direct.  And the >>manager<< had the stones to ask for \"just give me 4 hours\".... we shall see.  9:31 am CST, still no mailing label.  Meanwhile, the no-battery streak is still sitting unshipped...  I'd give it 1 star at this point, and only grudgingly.*****************************Final Edit: At last, late Friday, the issue is to be resolved.  After speaking to a higher-level manager, Dell will be cross-shipping me a replacement Streak, and I'm to return mine within that shipping container (pre-printed label to be included inside).  This is an acceptable solution, but it should not have had to take so many phone calls, and a whole week to resolve.", "Title": "Love the Streak, hate the tech support", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Author": "Paperback Writer", "ReviewID": "R3KSQKGTFQ0AWY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Unlike these other reviewers (who are basing their reviews on the 3g model), I've actually had the opportunity to mess with the wifi-only model last week.Onto the review, A tablet with these specs should NOT be as slow as this tablet is.

7\" tablet - go with the Dell streak 7\" - fully featured.  Decent display and build quality  (2) But if you are looking for the best quality in terms of build, UI, touch screen, and willing to compromise on the features (GPS, camera ...) - go with the Kindle Fire.", "Title": "One of the best fully featured 7\" tablet out there", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Author": "MR Cart \"Cart\"", "ReviewID": "RK6JXVTPZXCE4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice tablet.the 7\" form factor along with a strong hardware and software spec is very nice.It runs streamed video and SD content smooth and with no issues yet.just following amazons instructions I was ablet to install the amazon market app so fast easy access to plenty of apps.the Update to 3.2  was no hassle and required nothing more than my consenting.people who rant about the screen, its fine for most stuff.However there is a huge flaw.the battery.No if buts or ways around, you can switch off just about every service and feature and still the battery is lame.in airplane mode with 1 app running screen at 20% NO WIFI no polling , no notifications vibrate turned off and everything i could find the max battery playing movies from SD card is 3:20 - 3 3:40tested both tablets twice from full overnight charge....in normal use its more like almost 3 hours...this is not acceptable for a mobile device.

Archos, Samsung, TouchPads, and these Dells. In fact I have 3 Dell Streak 7s.Pros: Fast dual core processor, full size SDHC slot, price.Cons: Poor screen resolution resulting in lousy blacks, poor viewing angle, proprietary plug, horrible battery life, loses WiFi connections frequently, and heavy. And when did Dell ever stick with a market it couldn't compete well in? Remember the PDA?The reason I use them is simple. The app that we run requires about an hour of use at a time. For the app resolution, these work great and the dual core makes things nice and speedy along with good screen touch sensitivity. Having the Dell name on them in a corporate environment is a plus.The reasons you would NOT want to use them for normal entertainment are paramount. For movie viewing, lousy viewing angle quality and resolution along with horrible battery life. You can get maybe one movie out of them on one charge. For a reader, same issues: so-so screen resolution for reading and somewhat dim in normal light. Way too heavy to hold up and read from, especially when lying on your back. I use my Archos 70 as a reader, much easier to hold for any period of time.In summary, if you want a cheap 7 incher, this is not a horrible choice, but right now there are a lot of options coming available and pricing is bound to keep moving downward. You greatly risk Dell leaving you high and dry as they did to us with the Dell PDAs. I predict Dell is out of the tab market within a year from now, maybe sooner.

The problem, however, is different than most people believe so I wanted to detail it here.I examined the Dell Streak 7 hardware closely to determine why it stopped receiving a charge.  When you plug the cable into the device you'll notice that the charging LED (light) does not come on and so you wonder why.  You may think it is something internal but it is actually the failed design of the power connector on the device.  It is a thin piece of ribbon cable, which is barely thicker than paper.  That piece of ribbon cable has to slip between two pieces on the power cable, but instead of slipping between the two pieces it will push to the left or right inside the device.This is a terribly failed hardware design.To me, this issue would be like selling a car where after 200 presses on the gas pedal, the entire accelerator mechanism is destroyed. At that point you can no longer drive the car at all. There is an expected level of service from a device and the design of the Dell Streak 7 is so terrible it almost seems as if it were on purpose.Anyway, here's how I've explained it to others.[-- You are correct about it not receiving a charge. This issue has been reported by many owners/users. Mine finally failed also. I'd like to include an explanation why it did so. It seems that the place where the power plug goes into the Dell Streak 7 is a piece of ribbon cable. That ribbon cable actually gets pushed out of the way -- left or right -- of the power cable. The piece of ribbon cable is not much thicker than paper and is pliable. That piece of cable on the device fails to go between the very thin connector pieces on the power cable side -- it bends out of the way. Basically, the cable side has a slot that the device-side ribbon cable (paper-thin) has to slide into. It is all very small of course. I kept trying to get the cable to attach to the device over and over and finally the piece of cable on the device side literally snapped off. Terrible. I was only able to use the device for about 6 months before this all happened. It is a terrible design that anyone with any hardware experience would know would fail quickly.

Maxwell \"Desert Rat\"", "ReviewID": "R1JVP66TNP6BLZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Full disclosure - I returned my Dell Streak 7, mainly due to a defective right speaker.  I was on the fence about getting a replacement, but in the end it just wasn't quite there for me.  That said, there are things that I absolutely liked about it, and a few things things that I didn't (aside from the defective speaker.)I like the 7\" form factor.  I know Steve Jobs and many other people pooh-pooh that size, but I find the iPad-sized tablets awkward to hold when lying in bed reading, or trying to type.  I much prefer the 7\", but - to each his own.  I have used iPads as we have one in my family, so this is not a blind comparison.The screen resolution is \"meh\". Yes I was aware of the screen resolution issue when I purchased it, and it really isn't a deal killer at the right price, but it could be better.  In fact, considering the really crummy rear facing camera, Dell should have nixed the camera altogether and spent the money on a better screen.  Personally I am not a fan of rear-facing cameras on tablets anyway, as they are awkward to use and fairly poor quality generally - on par with smartphone quality, in which case I'd prefer to simply use my smartphone to snap candid pics, and use my dSLR for actual photography.  Front-cameras I understand, but with the Dell Streak 7, I can't comment because the Wi-Fi version didn't have any software that could access it.  Even the built-in camera app doesn't offer the option to switch to front camera, as far as I could tell.  Strange that.The Streak is fast, web pages load quickly, and there is not much lag when opening apps.  Flash worked surprisingly well - I could watch Amazon Prime Instant Videos without a hiccup.  Flash does seem to slow down the load time of web pages, but once it is loaded, the Streak worked quite well.  It was nice being able to browse news sites and watch the videos embedded in the page. I did experience quite a few crashes, again not a deal killer, but more than I would expect for a fairly mature operating system running on a fast processor. As many have mentioned, the battery life is pretty dismal - not an issue for me as it was being used as an \"around the house\" gadget, but if you took this thing out on the town, I would be worried that the battery wouldn't last the day.  Also the Wi-Fi would drop every once in awhile and not log back on automatically, so I would have to manually re-connect.  Maybe there is a setting I am not aware of that would fix that problem.I'm not going to spend much time in this review talking about the Android Froyo operating system, suffice to say, Dell really needs to upgrade to Honeycomb, as the rumors suggest they will.  Froyo just seems so, 2008 - in fact I used to have (still have actually) a Nokia N800, and the mail and calendar apps on the Streak 7 seem no better than the apps on the N800.  The overall polish of the OS was lacking.  So, I don't know.  I'm no Apple fanboy, but to me, the Streak 7 could be the greatest thing ever, if there were no such thing as an iPad.  But compared to the iPad, the Streak is very unrefined, just about 80% there.For the price, if Dell upgrades the OS, it's worth it, assuming your copy isn't defective.

DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET !This tablet is one of the most poorly designed devices I have ever had the displeasure to hold in my hands. The entire experience is poor.The screen resolution on this tablet is 800 x 480, which is very small. Pre-Smartphone era cellphones had better resolutions on physically smaller screens. Everything you view will appear either stretched or scaled, and MANY 3rd party apps which SHOULD work will not work well because they simply will not fit on the screen. A perfect example of this is Netflix. The Netflix app is supported, however, when you choose a show ,and you are viewing the menu in landscape mode, the screen is too small to display any part of the window. You can rotate the device so that you are viewing the menu in portrait mode, however even then you cannot scroll through all of the episodes in a season because the Streak's miniscule resolution cuts off the window. There is nothing that can be done about this, and , Netflix will not allow you to add individual episodes of shows to your Que, only the show itself, so , while you are fine to watch movies which do not require you to make a selection beyond \"Play Now\"; if you want to watch a show that has more than 6 episodes you are out of luck. The screen res simply will not allow you to access anything lower on the menu than episode 6. And anything you watch will be in poor quality due to the extremely low resolution screen. This issue is not limited to Netflix, it is actually quite common among everything from Note Taking applications to Games to media display apps.I should also mention that if you plan to use this device as a reader you will find it awkward. The screen resolution is too low to display small text without some blurring occuring, so you have to make the text so large that only a half dozen or so sentences fit on the page. Thats a lot of page flipping and it breaks the experience a little. A reader is supposed to simulate a real book, not deliver a book in headlines.The screen itself is of an amzaingly poor design. If you view the tablet in Landscape mode with the Front Facing camera pointing down (which is the opposite of the way the hard keys are situated and the opposite of the way app display defaults to) you will get a slightly \"washed out\" but reasonably bright display which is adequate for the tiny resolution. If you turn it over and hold it (in landscape) with the Front Facing Camera on the top (which is the default) the screen becomes very dark and hard to see. It becomes so dark in fact that even colors like yellow or white appear to be a dark shade of bluish grey. You can place it directly in front of your eyes when held this way to get the best viewing experience but if you are not looking DIRECTLY (as in 0 angle from eye level) the screen darkness effect kicks in and you will not be able to see much at all :(Using this tablet in portrait mode, regardless of how you hold it, will result in half the screen adopting that bluish-grey darkness and half of it being overly bright. It is really not functional at all in portrait mode.The glare on the Dell Streak screen is unreal. Even the dimmest light source overhead will totally eclipse the screen. I purchased an anti-glare screen protector, which definetly helped a lot with this, however, the glare was still present. Even with the shield on it really can't be used outside or in a place with reasonably bright lights indoors, like a McDonalds or your local shopping mall.The touch response is also horrible. It seems to work even more poorly when it is charging. While charging you have to press very hard to get your touches to register. It is so bad that you can't even use the standard keyboard, you have to use swype and it misses enough letters during swype to make input a horrible chore.When it is not charging the touch sensitivity is definetly smoother. Swype is very responsive and the standard keyboard works well enough. Screen navigation is much easier and hard presses are not required, however, if you want to use a stylus......... forget about it. The screen is simply not sensitive enough to be compatible with a stylus. This may not matter to you, but , if you ever want to draw something, take handwritten notes, trace a route on a map, or, highlight something in a book or PDF you will find it to be a frustrating chore (even with your finger) that will likely require several tries for every line you draw.The battery life in the Dell Streak 7 is abhorrent. Even in standby mode the battery will not last all day. If you go into airplane mode, *and*, dim the screen to a point where it is just a little too dim to watch without eyestrain, you can watch a full 2 hour movie before the battery is depleted, provided you started with a full charge. If you are into gaming you will be blown away by the battery consumption that takes place when playing any games that make use of the Nvidia Tegra hardware that is built into the Streak. 15 minutes of \"Samurai Vengance II\" will literally use your entire battery. I went from 100% Fully Charged to 15% in about 10 minutes, and then the Power Saver function came on and stopped the game, (without saving my progress), and warned me that I needed to plug in the device. I was not in a place where I could plug it in , so , I turned it off and I figured i would charge it when I got home. When I got home and plugged it in I had to charge it for almost an hour before I could even turn it on, and , when I did, it had Factory Reset itself, so all my apps, info, accounts and customizations needed to be reinstalled, and all my notes and photos and videos were simply lost. The battery in the Streak 7 is really this bad. This is not an exagerration.The speakers on the Dell Streak 7 are surprisingly good. Music sounds better through this device than it does coming from my Ipad2 or my HTC Flyer. (both of which are awesome devices) This is , unfortunately, the only feature I have anything good to say about. The speakers really are top notch. The Mic however is piss poor. In fairness it may not be the mic that sucks, it may just be that the Streak itself is too sluggish and choppy to interpolate input through the microphone, either way USING the mic sucks.The Wi-Fi on the Streak is very slow, streaming media is always choppy and pauses to load more than on any other device I have ever seen. This is not due to my connection, I have a good connection and I use other devices without issue.Speaking of streaming media..... YouTube will no longer function on the Dell Streak............. here is why.......... The new YouTube apps are not supported, you can't even download them from the official marketplace because they require greater screen resolution. There is a YouTube system app pre-installed on the Dell Streak 7 which you cannot remove. Because the newer versions of the You Tube app require greater screen rez, you are unable to update the pre-installed version. The pre installed version was made BEFORE YouTube required you to link your YouTube account to your Google account. Because it cannot understand YouTubes new server handshakes it will not allow you to login.......... So,.........you can't get the version that YouTube requires, and, you can't use the preinstalled app....... but guess what? It is a system app , so not only can you not uninstall it, but it will continue to run in the background consuming what little memory the Dell Streak has available for programs that do work. Its a complicated little situation that really doesn't make sense and its not really fair to Dell, YouTube or the end user....... but............. it seems fitting that this type of thing would happen on such a backwards little device. It just seems to fit into the spirit of the Dell Streak 7 very appropriately.I bought this item for my girlfriend because she has never had a device of her own and at around $200 it seemed like a decent investment on paper. I had also considered a Kindle Fire, but, the lack of GPS and the inability to use Google apps and the Official Android Marketplace made me decide that the functions of the Kindle were simply too limited. I wanted her to have a device that could \"do it all\".She got so frustrated with the Streak 7 that she gave it back to me. She is not especially tech-savvy (nor is she especially tech-tarded)so at first I thought she was a little overwhelmed , because its her first device and these things can be a little confusing before you get used to them....... So I used it for a couple days to see what she was talking about..... and now its being returned. It really , truly is a genuine piece of garbage.I am getting her an HTC Evo View (which I know is a great device as I have been using a Flyer since the day they came out). Its less than $100 bucks more than the streak and it is absolutely worth the difference in price. I really regret having gone the cheapskate route...... I just figured that it would be appropriate for her first device..... I was wrong, the Streak 7 is not an approproiate device for anyone.The bottom line is that this Tablet is not going to make you happy.", "Title": "PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY A DELL STREAK 7", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "NSS", "ReviewID": "RPBJ9VIFOGIO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy now...I finally received my dell streak 7 and its awesome.

However, I tested this myself, and removing the SIM card only prevents use of WiFi and cellular services.  I could still play games and use apps that were already installed.The menu system navigates like an Android smart phone (which it kind of is), and if you have any experience using one (I have an HTC Incredible) you should feel comfortable navigating the menus.Unsurprisingly, the Streak 7 arrived with only a minimal charge on the battery.  I am pleased to see that the power cable has both AC wall-jack and USB capability, but I am saddened to see that the power/data port on the device is a proprietary one (and not micro USB).  That means that if you lose, or break, the cable that came with your system you are going to have to replace it with a Dell (or Dell licensed) cable.The battery itself is non-removable, and that means that no backup batteries or larger replacements.  If your battery fails you will have to send it back to Dell to have it replaced (or void your warrantee).  The battery life is not great.  I experienced about a 3-4 hour battery life with the WiFi enabled.The display is crisp and clear.  Most app and games look very nice.  The touch screen is very responsive with some apps/games, but sluggish with others.  Unfortunately, navigating around in the Android OS is sluggish and non-responsive.  Hopefully this can be improved with future updates.As an ebook reader it is a significant improvement over my smart phone.  The text can be sized to read comfortably (app dependent) and the readable area is slightly smaller than a digest-sized book.  Again the screen is clear and vibrant, and text appears crisp and legible.  As a PDF reader it also works fairly well.  Smaller, well constructed PDF documents open easily and quickly, but larger documents cause significant slowdown.", "Title": "Good for now, hope to see improvements", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Author": "Jon Norris", "ReviewID": "RSSVOORJRC7VZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited at the thought of getting my hands on this. While I had read many reviews which were not favorable, I was looking forward to seeing for myself. Most of the negative reviews trashed the display resolution, which is 800 x 480, and that is way too low for a 7 inch screen. Interestingly enough, I found the display adequate, and that was not what disappointed me so greatly.First off, this is the WiFi version, so I expected a more computer-like experience. WRONG. You have probably heard it before, but Android is simply not a computer OS, it is a phone OS. Scaling that up to a tablet simply gives you a big phone screen. It may be fine for toys and phones, but fails miserably if one is expecting a real computer experience, which I was.Even though there are no phone (cell) radios, most of the apps included are for phone-based operations, which I found a pretty stupid choice. I was hoping for a lot of standalone apps and apps which would function well on WiFi over the net. WRONG. Most of the apps are for calling, messaging, texting, and other cellphone-based activities. Almost all the included apps require a network connection, and the few standalone apps included were either very plain, restricted to minimal use until you upgraded to the for-pay version, or just lousy.The most functional parts are the camera and the driving game. The camera functions pretty well, but the game is limited to one car at one level, and doesn't offer very much of interest after about 5 minutes. The office suite included is very poor, and trying to use the word processor for even a very simple shopping list proved to be an exercise in frustration. There were no regular cursor/mouse controls, or selecting text for deleting, cutting, replacing, etc. Lame. Saving and re-opening my list caused it to completely reformat and scramble the words. Lame. I gave up at that point. Word processors have been around for 30 years, and there is simply NO excuse for a word processor this lame to ever get out the door, period.Another problem for this device is its identity crisis: is it a tablet or a phone? Well, it is too big for a phone, and it is nowhere near functional enough for a tablet. It is an awkward size to hold - too big for one hand, but almost too small for two. The flat shape is hard to hold, and the ergonomics of this shape are just not great. I guess ergonomics have gone out of style in design these days, or else it is no longer taught in design school. (If it ever was.)Yet another major problem is that is came with no manual at all. The Quick Start guide was pathetic and often incomplete or just plain wrong. I had to hunt down a pdf of the manual on Dell's site, download it on another computer, and transfer it by SD card to read it on the Streak.  How hard would it have been to include it on the device? Extraordinarily lame.Even as a media player, it is mediocre. It only plays an extremely limited umber of formats, and is not great at those. It does not recognize folders on the external SD card, and throws all the files from all the folders into one big list, in no particular order. Sloppy and hard to use.Browsing the web is also disappointing. Some of the uses I had envisioned for the Streak it cannot do because it is not able to interact properly with some web pages. My experiments in trying to download new apps have all failed - in one case it sat for hours telling me the apps were downloading, then ran the battery down without ever finishing even a single download. No progress gauge, no info on how complete the files were, nothing.I am also extremely disappointed in Android. Google has said it was not ready for tablets, and they were right on the money. It is an interface for toys and phones, not for serious computer work, period. Since I am not a gamer and didn't grow up with a Gameboy glued to my hands, this kind of interface is more of an obstacle to productive work than a help. Using the Streak, I got a clear insight into all the noise about \"modern interfaces\" going on in circles like the Linux community. I guess we are going to be bombarded with a raft of toy-like interfaces from this generation of programmers, so I'd better get used to it. Kind of like cash registers with pictures of items instead of real numbers... (yep, showing my age here, folks....)I have only been using it for a few days, and will update this review as I get more experience.UPDATE: April 28: Friendly post let me know that Dell fouled up and shipped all Vine people the wrong tablet - it is a T-Mobile tablet instead of the Wifi version - hence all the phone-related apps. Good job, Dell, sending the wrong tablet to the people you are hoping will help promote it. Really not the smartest move. Still doesn't effect all my other complaints, though.UPDATE: December 2011Apparently I am not alone in my disappointment. Dell has cancelled the unit and is getting out of the Android tablet business. Probably just as well, since they didn't seem to be doing a very good job there.", "Title": "first impressions - extremely disappointing - UPDATE Dec. 2011", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Author": "patricia mathis", "ReviewID": "R36WI05J82XTXV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Dell people donot speak English, will not help fix erorrs for panel and hard drive o not usable broken and will notstand behind warranty.", "Title": "do not stand behind warrantee", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "shay", "ReviewID": "R2JZ4YTSR8GC9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm satisfied with the dell streak 7 and the excellent customer service I received from the seller.
