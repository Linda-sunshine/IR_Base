I own 4 tablets as well as a Kindle Fire, and this tablet definitely keeps up with everything I throw at it. It is surprisingly fast and rich in features.This is NOT one of those \"cheap\" tablets that are always run-of-the-mill, and lack in features. It has Google Play where as others don't. Oddly enough, this tablet keeps up with one of my other tablets that I paid about twice the price for. Also, I noticed that this tablet is the exact same size as an iPad mini.I really have no complaints about this tablet. Everything works as expected and often times better than expected. It really does.As for people who complain that it is plastic, that complaint is ridiculous. Of course it is made from durable plastic, That kind of complaint is most likely made by people who have iPhones that have metal backs, other than that, they are plastic as well! Not to mention, the problem you see on EVERY iPhone is that the metal backs are seriously scratched up, where as this isn't. So keep that in mind.If you want to be a hipster that has a scratched iPad like everyone else, then go ahead.... However, if you want an incredible Android tablet for an incredible price, then you found it.", "Title": "This has to be one of the best Android tablets for the price!", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "L.

I thought getting him his own tablet for Christmas would give him a sense of independence and get Mom's more expensive phone out of harm's way. It's a decent tablet considering it's low price, but there are some definite limitations. I'm used to using an iPad 2, iPhone 4, and Surface Pro 2, so my review is in comparison to those higher-end devices.PROS:Budget tablet that won't be a huge problem if he breaks it.Has the Google Play store, so a ton of major apps and games.Decent screen - doesn't look like a cheap tablet at first glance.Build quality is pretty good for a \"cheap\" product.CONS:Slower than I'm used to. If you're used to using an iPad, be prepared to notice some lag with this device.Limited storage space. A lot of newer, more popular games on the Play store are around a GB - one or two of those and the device is chock full.Screen has very limited viewing angles. It's fine if you're looking straight-on, but as your line-of-sight gets angled, view ability drops off precipitously.All in all, it's plenty fine for my 3 year old son. However, if you're an adult and expect a frustration-free tablet experience, I'd recommend spending just a little bit more money to get a device that doesn't have quite as many limitations.", "Title": "Decent tablet for a 3 year old", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Steam-name: Gavnation00", "ReviewID": "R17ML7MWVE6PPG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well to start out: Its a budget tablet.

I purchased this for my grand daughter so that she could play games and watch movies and videos but the sound is barely above a whisper, so the purpose is defeated.I did call the Acer service number and their representative suggested using a speaker with the tablet or sending it back for them to check for hardware issues, neither suggestion was feasible for me as the sound shouldn't be so poor as to need external speakers and I planned to give my grand this as a gift for xmas.
