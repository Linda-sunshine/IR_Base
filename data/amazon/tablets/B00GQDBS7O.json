The retina is pretty but to me its unnecessary; i thought the resolution on my iPad 2 looked just fine.  The newer processer in the mini with retina is what really impresses me.  I didn't realize that i had gotten accustomed to waiting a few seconds for apps to open and again while switching between them.  This new iPad mini doesn't have any of that \"lag\" i experienced with the iPad 2.  It switches between apps seamlessly and quickly.  It also has impressive battery life, i can start the week with it fully charged, watch netflix on my breaks and lunches at work and i will usually run out of juice about the end of the day thursday.  And i use it throughout the day to check emails, online banking, send iMessages etc.  Also, despite some reservations i had at first about the smaller screen size, the clarity more than makes up for it and it is the perfect size for holding in one hand.

I'm not going to list them all because other reviewers have listed most of them already. I do have to say if you are looking for a tablet because you are planning on buying and reading books, I would highly recommend this. In my opinion the kindle app on this tablet is perfect for reading books. For me, reading on this really feels like reading a book and doesn't feel like reading on a tablet. When I set the color to sepia and turn the brightness low, the screen does not burn my eyes at all.Most people might already know this but I wanted to mention that the kindle app is slightly different on other tablets. I don't know why but the kindle app for the ipad mini gives you more options than the Samsung galaxy tablets. Apple's kindle app lets you change the font and lets you highlight text in 4 colors. You can't change the font with Samsung's kindle app and you can only highlight with 1 color instead of 4. I also want to mention the color sepia is also different in other devices. I personally prefer apples version of the color sepia because it doesn't burn my eyes when I'm reading books.If you are planning on buying this to play games, I would highly recommend getting 32gb or more. 16gb is really not a lot of space if you are downloading a lot of games. Apple actually has a lot of great games so trust me will download more games than you expected...The only thing I don't like about the iPad Mini with retina display is that a lot of the free games have way too much adds and commercials. Other than that I can't think of anything else I don't like about this device.

Only regret is we should have bought a 32GB or 64GB model, maybe with cellular, but we only had limited funds. Will be saving up for a higher model and let the kids have this one. The iPad mini is just so much better than everything else. Sorry, Amazon! I love Amazon but even the latest Kindle fire is UGLY and very difficult to use. All Android tablets are boring and susceptible to viruses.  The iPad mini gives a consistent experience. I just wish the App Store had a grid listing view like on Windows 8. Other than that my iPad mini connects to WiFi every time and maximizes the speed, unlike the other tablets. The screen is totally the best! I play Amazon videos and they've never looked better.

I got the iPad mini because I needed a device to be used for school work. I needed something portable, great battery life, and functional. I was going to get another laptop after mine took a coffee bath but decided to go with the iPad mini because I was able to get it through AT&T; for only $20 a month so I didn't have to shell out a huge chunk of change. And I get have internet pretty much everywhere I go and don't have to worry about connecting to wifi just to do some web browsing.The iPad mini works great for me because I have a lot of down time between shifts at work. My shifts are only about two hours, but I'll have 3 or 4 shifts a day and sometimes 30 minutes to an hour downtime between each so I get to cram in school work between. It's super portable, I just throw it in my backpack and because of the battery life I just leave the charge cable at home. No ned to lug around a clunky laptop.With a keyboard this really has replaced my laptop, there is some trade offs. I don't have a mouse and getting used to apple software and its limitations. But for youtubing, writing and web browsing it is great.I don't like the App Store, I feel the apps on there are trying to nickel and dime you for every last penny. You really need to watch what you buy and make sure it is what you are paying for. The first night I had it I paid 5 bucks for a word processor (silly me) that I thought was Microsoft word it turned out to be just a bunch of tutorial videos. The games are even worse, the free to play games want you to pay for everything. There are good games and apps but its hard to find them because of all the crap in the App Store. There are thousands of bad apps for every good one.  I would give this a 5 star if the App Store wasn't so crappy, apple needs better content curation.Despite the App Store and the software limitations I was able to accept a few trade offs for the great battery life and portability.", "Title": "Great for me but not for all.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "p joel nishanth", "ReviewID": "R3HXN2P84PNCGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this through Adasbooks1 seller.

The rear camera takes excellent  pictures just as good as the iphone 5 i belive, and the front facing camera also has good resolution.

I watch movies in it mostly on netflix, they look great, i also do all of my social media, web surfing  and emailing with no trouble. One of the things that got me to buy this ipad, where the excellent free apps tha come with it, it comes with: imovie, iphoto, garageband, keynote, numbers, and pages and they are all amazing apps, and i believe they are all worth about 45$, so it's a great value, specially if you are like me, who makes music all the time and edit videos also from time to time.

However, as you will see below I have some major gripes with the price/features combination for this model. Lately I have been seriously thinking about upgrading my iPad 3. Tried the new Samsung Tab 10.1 (2014), iPad Air, and this Mini. Neither one of those larger tables really tempted me to give up on my iPad 3. Yes, they were a bit better in this and in that, but eventually neither one felt twice as good as my iPad 3 to justify their price (I figured that I would have to double the $280 or so that would get after selling my iPad 3).iPad Mini retina did feel like a major upgrade in terms of size and weight. In fact, it is a better value in terms of size/weight vs screen size against iPad 3: you are dropping 50% of the weight and only losing 33% of the screen real estate (and nothing in resolution, of course). Surprisingly, most of the time I did not even feel any limitations of the smaller screen. I think part of the reason that made me like the new iPad Mini was that lately I have got a MBPr and the need for a larger retina screen now is satisfied by the laptop while the compactness of the tablet becomes more important.However, there are two main problems that I have with the new Mini. One, is the limited gamut of the screen. I might be picky, but I do see the difference and not only side by side, but also when moving from one device to another. The larger iPad's home screen looks simply gorgeous in comparison to the Mini's home screen. (Probably, part of the reason is that I kept iOS 6 on my iPad 3 and it's color scheme is less \"whitish.\")Another problem is pricing. How come after all these years of upgrading its larger tablets without increasing the price Apple decided to do it differently with the iPad Mini? The \"original\" iPad Mini was $330 and the iPad Mini retina is $400? Yes, the Mini got better, but the Air got better too with no price increase, same thing with iPad 4, iPad 3, and iPad 2. If they kept the price at $330 I would overlook the bleaker screen and go for it. Or if the screen had 100% gamut I would pay $400. But not both. I can not justify paying that much money while not feeling that I am getting a premium product. There are way cheaper tablets out there with 100% gamut and I do not want to pay $400 for a tablet and feel that it is inferior to a $220 tablet when it comes to such an important parameter as its screen.You can see how much fewer reviews of this tablet are out there on amazon compared to the iPad Air. Seems like people are just not buying this model as much. I am returning the Mini and waiting until Apple comes up with an upgraded model that has 100% gamut screen. And they better not add another $70-$100 chunk on the top of the price when it happens!", "Title": "Nice tablet, but a bit of a rip off..", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Grace Rojas", "ReviewID": "R1PH74FO1X5BCY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product is fine, was new and in good conditions...
