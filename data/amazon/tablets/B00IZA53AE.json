The Antutu Benchmark score is not 20042 but is 19413 which is very good. Netflix,  HuluPlus, the NCAA tournament and Comcast run smoothly. My daughter loves it.  Oh, it did score above the Nexus on the benchmark test. It's very responsive and it is HD and I said the graphics could be a little better because the viewing angles are good, but could be better.  Overall a solid device and I gotta buy another one for my other daughter.  It's close to the size of my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and just as fast as my Tab 2 and Galaxy S4.", "Title": "Very good tablet....solid construction", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Author": "Larry Henry \"\u2014Larry\"", "ReviewID": "R3C89RH5EYQT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The performance of this tablet is great. I threw lots of stuff at it and it never staggered or paused. The processor and the graphics handling makes everything you do smooth. The capacitive screen worked great for me, no issues at all. I tested Skype, Netflix, plying videos and music, Chrome, Drawing applications and e-mail; everything worked very well. The battery life is proving to be very good.What I wasn't overly happy about was the placement of the front camera; it's awkward at times during video conferencing. The speaker volume isn't that great, but a Bluetooth sound cannon or headsets worked great. Also, I noticed the stylus that was included with the unit didn't work very well at all. I contacted iRulu about it and they're working on a resolution.I did a full review on it on my website:[...]I hope this helps...", "Title": "This is/was a confident purchase; perfect for a gift.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lubomira Sieradzka", "ReviewID": "RBH8BMA7KYWIW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I mostly bought this to convert it to a small laptop for the purpose of writing. I went to get some advice from my boyfriend since he was a techy and knows much more about things associated with the computer. He was very much against me getting a generic device over a brand name. Against his wishes, I ordered this one and I am happy to say I did! I am no professional and I just wanted something that I could take to the library or cafe to do some writing. This little tab does that and more. I am very pleased.Positives:The quality is very good. It doesn't feel cheapTouch sensitivity is very good and can easily compete with the name brand tab my bf has.Images and graphics come out sharpResponse well to add ons life a keyboardHas different ports for chargingBattery life is goodGoogle App games function without a problem (yes, you can play Candy Crush Saga or Farm Hero Saga)Negative:It's heavier (but at the same time it does seem solid)", "Title": "Just what I needed and at a fraction of the cost", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3AUE220B6PIYN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the tablet quickly from the supplier, after charging the first time I was able to download some apps and used the tablet for about one hour.

Product must have had a heavy object laying on it and caused it to have a white mark on the top right corner of the screen.
