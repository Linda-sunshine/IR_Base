She adores it. It runs android 4.0.4 out of the box(can't update to newer ones as far as I can tell, but I haven't had a chance to play around with it because she won't put it down.)It is smaller than an Ipad, at 7 inches, but the same size as the Ipad Mini. The camera is good(not great) quality. It has a pretty fast CPU/ram setup because it can run 7-8 apps at once before slowdown occurs. We know this because by default it DOES NOT close apps when you leave them. You need to adjust the settings or you will have a lot more running than you would like. There is a setting that closes apps on exit. It comes with a USB adapter which allows you to plug in a USB mouse or keyboard(why my fiance uses a mouse on a touchscreen,I have no idea but it makes her happy). The resolution on the screen is decent, not HD quality but good enough. I would say DVD quality.For 75$, it is a great bargain. She loves the pink color.My only issues are that it is prone to scratching(on the case) and it does not come with a screen protector(which is a MUST for a touchscreen, the Kindle 7\" ones will work for very cheap.) If you buy it, plan to buy a case, screen protector and an SDHC micro flash card(the one it comes with is 1GB, with about 1GB built in, decent but if you want more than a few apps and pictures, grab an 8GB or 16GB cheap.)Overall well worth the money.::Edit::It is important to note you can also use the other USB chord to connect to a PC. Useful for downloading apps. Also it supports WiFi tranfers of data. So you can actually transfer apps, music and movies from a laptop or wifi enabled PC without using the USB chord, which is very nice", "Title": "Can't go wrong for the price", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "M.

It is a Christmas present for my 18-month-old daughter. I set up Skype so we can talk to grandma, downloaded a bunch of videos, and installed a bunch of toddler games and kiddie music apps. If you have used a newer Android phone, you will be very familiar with this interface because it is almost identical and it was very easy to set up. All of my setup work went off without a hitch and it never crashed once (surprising for an Android)! As an added bonus, they included a screen protector, so they must have been paying attention to other reviewers who said that it needed one!For all intents, this will be a perfectly functional tablet for my toddler and because of the low price I won't have to worry if it gets damaged. I would have given it four stars but there are a few problems that I find worth mentioning, and they were enough to knock off a star:1. Internal memory is 1GB, NOT 4GB as stated in the product details. Thankfully, Apps2SD works on this tablet without rooting, and I already had a 32GB micro SD card from an old phone that mounted with no problem in this tablet, so I shouldn't run into much trouble with the limited onboard memory.2. Charger stopped working the first night. There are two ways to charge this tablet - through the DC charger port and through the micro USB port. I was originally charging through the DC port and for some reason it just stopped charging. I unplugged and re-plugged the charger but it still wouldn't charge. I can charge through the USB with no problem but it is something worth mentioning.3. Strange angle on the front facing camera. While testing Skype I noticed that the front-facing camera is angled up. That will be a slight inconvenience because one would typically hold this tablet on his/her lap and tilt it up to use the front camera. If you do that on this tablet, the camera will be aimed at your forehead, so it must be slightly angled downward to get a good angle with that camera. This is not an issue of my height because I am 6' tall.4. Poor viewing at an angle. The picture quality drops off rapidly as you tilt or turn the screen, so one must keep it close to perpendicular with ones eyes to get a good picture.I will come back and update if I find anything else worth mentioning, but so far it is a \"just ok\" tablet that will work for its intended purpose.", "Title": "Simple device which works, but nothing special", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "T.

I found this on NoMoreRack and the price was rights so I got it.  I was a little nervous, since it was a no-name brand and my track record with NoMoreRack has not been great (brought so called $80 headphones for $7, sounded like $2), but I ended up getting it just before Christmas and trying it out.I was very impressed!  It was fast and responsive, and handled gaming, surfing, and even Youtube quite well.  It was a bit thick and heavy, but not unbearably so and it performed much better than any of my family's budget tablets.  I thought that I'd found a real winner!Until it died.  The day after I got it, I was doing some light gaming.  The battery was wearing down, and I was going to run it out and recharge it.  It gave me a message about the battery being low (10% I think), and then the screen was covered with white lines and static (that's the best way I can describe it).  I put it to sleep and then woke it up, but the lines/static remained.  And then it shut down with a pop.  Needless to say, I doubt it will recover, though I am going to try.  It has a 12 month warranty, so I'll see how well they respond.  If they do well, then this is just an exception and not the rule, and I'll change my rating.  If not, it will remain.So in conclusion, based on the other reviews here, it appears that this is an impressive tablet that suffers from quality control problems.  If you get it, be sure you can take it back or be prepared to wait on warranty service (I'll edit this review when I've had that experience).UPDATE: It seems that the whole \"white out\" thing happens every time that the thing gets low on power.  As such, I am confident in my rating.  If they can fix that irritating bug, then this will be a 4 or 5 star product...", "Title": "Great...

Although it's manual is lousy, the tablet itself is fairly easy to use.CONS:01. The firmware available on Zeepad's website WAS NOT the same firmware that was pre-installed on this tablet. One incident beyond my control caused my tablet to freeze on its third boot up screen and factory reset couldn't resolve that issue. I was forced to download a firmware from Zeepad's website and was in for the following surprise:A. My tablet's Internal Storage for apps went from 0.98GB to a lousy 504MB.B. My tablet's Internal Storage for system functions went from 0.98GB to 1.50GB.C. My tablet won't rotate between landscape and portrait orientations unless certain apps are launched. It rotated just fine on its pre-installed firmware.D. (This is more of a Google issue.) The Google Play icon was no longer a permanent icon on the home screen's menu bar. This appeared on the navigation bar on its pre-installed firmware.E. Two volume icons and some \"Emergency Calls\" icon are now on the navigation bar. These icons, which I find unless, weren't on my tablet's pre-installed firmware.02. Zeepad's website has NO contact info listed. Sure, they have \"About US\" and \"Contact US\" on their website's navigation menu, but clicking on to them does nothing.03. The user manual that came with this Zeepad 7.0 is one of the worst manuals I ever read. Even an seasoned reader will have difficulty figuring out how to interpret this manual's broken English.04. Google's stupid \"no downloading apps directly onto a microSD Card actually discourages users from even using Google Play in the first place. Why bother downloading new apps when your tablet barely has any internal storage for them.05. Sometimes the tablet wouldn't turn on when I'm powering it on. It would take about 2-3 attempts before I can turn it back on at times.06. I initially had trouble inserting my earphone jack into this tablet. Oh, and the earphones that come with it are quite flimsy.07. The AC adapter cord is too short. You'll likely need an extension cord for it.08. The battery life is as pitiful as its manual. Even when fully charged and on low brightness, it'll still drain within an hour or so", "Title": "This tablet's affordable, but not worth it in the long run.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Author": "Frank P.", "ReviewID": "R1ZAQ0UZGDN5LY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 6 year old granddaughter found this (Pink 7.0 android tablet) to be easy to run and learn other things on it.

I emailed Amazon and the guys were great. I got my package back marked \"Unclaimed\". They looked high and low to find out why. I sent it a second time and this time they received it back in a shambles. The bag was opened, my letter was missing and I said well there goes $180.00 bucks. No these guys are great.
