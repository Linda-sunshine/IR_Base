Came with all sorts of bugs that took ages to be fixed with driver updates that took forever to be released. All of that while waiting for my keyboard and dock to be delivered. months later and still with all sorts of driver problems, the keyboard and dock order got delayed. Then they got delayed again. Then it became a routine where every week I'd get a note saying it was delayed for another week until I realized Dell must think I'm a clown so I requested to cancel the order and get my return back. BUT it turns out I needed a \"special authorization\" to return my tablet as I had it for 3 months (yes, 3 months waiting for the freaking keyboard). When I finally got that, Dell sent UPS TWICE to come pick it up. The first UPS guy got it, and the second came to pick up nothing, and again on the next day and the day after. And Dell kept sending me reminders that they were still waiting for the freaking tablet to be returned. Seriously, Dell? You guys used to offer a decent service. I used to be a big Dell advocate but right now my suggestion is: Stay away.

I hope Michael Dell takes the company private again, because whatever corner-cutting Corporates are running things now don't seem overly concerned with customer satisfaction.

This is to the best of my recollection the events around my now returned Dell Venue 11 Pro 128GB, i5 tablet.Any statements below are my opinion and like anyones struggle, must be taken as such. (lawyers, leave us alone).November, 2013:I ordered the top-of-the-line Dell Venue 11 Pro - 128GB, Intel i5 processor (model 7139), and the optional stylus and keyboard/battery unit with the 3yr extended warranty.Within a couple of weeks, Dell told me the unit I purchased was \"no longer in production\". What? That model had not even shipped and it was discontinued? After considerable calls to Dell, they said a suitable replacement was going to be shipped instead; no word on what had changed and more frightening still was that they kept the same model number with undisclosed changes.Okay, I agreed to the change and finally on January 16th, 2014, the unit arrived.Now it really gets interesting... the stylus and battery keyboard arrived long before (and their warranty clock was ticking) but over a month later, I still did not have the tablet to even test the stylus and keyboard.January 2014:Finally, on January 16th, 2014, the unit arrived (so much for a Christmas arrival as promised originally).I won't go into the full litany of lock-ups, freezes, refusal to wake-up after sleep mode, or even wake up at all without a hard restart (and bizarre touch screen behavior) but I will say that I soon found I was far from alone. Dell's forum (google \"dell venue pro 11 freezing\" to start you on the adventure) was afire with every range of similar reports.After replacing my power adapter (in response to my wobbly micro-USB connector), Dell finally ordered a new motherboard.After that the machine was now totally useless. At his departure, the Dell tech told me to remove the battery every time I needed to shutdown as it would neither power up or down w/o physically cycling the battery. He also said if it was his machine, he'd demand a full refund. Even when it would finally stir to some faction of life by lord knows what combination finally worked,  it would start to load then crash,.. or run for 5 minutes and reset... or simply buzz audibly with the fan at high speed and never even POST (or shut off w/o removing the cover and physically removing the HOT HOT HOT battery.After following the forums and seeing how many others were bemoaning the same problems despite rflashing many versions of the firmware and tweaking registry and software all to no avail, my wife hung in there and finally got Dell to admit there were thousands of problem units out there and no one (at least at tech-support level knew what was to become of them.In the end (I hope, with Dell's final agreement, we shipped everything back (they received it May 5, 2014) and now we wait for Dell's system to return our > $1,000 within 30 days. (or was it business days?)I'm so torn. I love the concept of the replaceable battery and ability to boot legacy USBs.That said, I bought my wife a Microsoft Surface Pro 128GB months before the Dell purchase and she has not had a single problem even though she is on it every day playing Farmville (massively CPU intensive). The surface's non-replaceable battery is a HUGE downside (lifetime under 2yrs of real world use) but at least she is using and enjoying her tablet that cost as much as the Dell brick.Dell is supposed to resume shipping something in mid-June (again, no idea what if anything will be different as they are still using the same model number) but they stopped shipping the units like mine quite some time ago. Hopefully after a few months of redesign, they'll be ready to alpa-test on the consumers again.Me, I'll watch the forums and wait to see whether the Surface Pro 3 has a replaceable battery,.. a bad sign, MS is mum on that topic and is just bragging of even more screen res on an already too-small screen to be a concern.Dell... make a tablet that works.Microsoft.. make a tablet that isnt a battery brick after 1-2yrs.Somebody, get it right.", "Title": "Terrible problems with my Dell Venue 11 Pro 128GB Intel i5 Top-Of-The-Line tablet (and I am one of thousands)", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "Kyle \"cylem\"", "ReviewID": "RO5IOK9778TTW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well I'm a big fan of windows tablets, I always like to see what's next. I was excited to see the newer power efficient i5's in the venue pro 11, and how they compared to the newer bay trail tablets that came out this holiday.Hardware: The venue 11 pro is a tiny bit of a lie, seeing as it is only 10.8 inches, but that's OK I prefer it like that over the 11.6 inch tablets. It weight around 1.8 lbs just the tablet and around 3 with the larger keyboard. This weight isn't to bad, but going back and trying my 1.2 lb T100 (2.4 with keyboard) it is noticeable then. The build quality is pretty great for the most part, the materials feel great and sturdy. One bad part is you can feel the batter shift around a bit, and the back cover over the battery is finicky and takes some effort to get on correctly sometimes. One note from taking off the back, i can clearly see an Msata SSD which looks to be easily removable so there is a plus.Some strange things include the sd card slot which needs a pin to poke into in order to extract it. I don't mind this myself but i'm sure there are people who take in and out sd cards a lot and this would be extremely annoying. The other thing is the micro usb port is apparently only for charging so any folks who planned on using it as a second usb port can put those dreams to rest.Display: The display colors look really great, much better than my T100, you can tell it's a quality screen. The IPS technology gives great viewing angles as expected. However I can't really tell the difference besides that between my 720p T100 and the 1080p Venue really, I don't think it helps a ton for normal browsing, videos,  words etc. at least on this small of a screen.Software: No surprises here really, windows 8.1 without really any junkware to be found. Dell had a thing or two for backup, and for some power settings. Speaking of software installed I had like around  95gb free when I first booted .SSD: The SSD ran really speedily, on crystalmark benchmark I ran with 3/100, the results were: Seq - R 425 W 268 / 512k - R 235 W 263 / 4K - R 25 W 84 / 4kQD32  R 328 W 199.So it performed just as good as my Plextor M3 Pro on my desktop.Battery Life: Well I did some testing with just the tablet itself (no keyboard battery or anything) I ran netflix for an hour and it drained about 20% of the battery = about 5 hours of Netflix on a full battery. Then I ran the peacekeeper browser benchmark for an hour and it drained about 15% = 6.6 hours of continuous web browsing which is pretty darn good. I would say on average you could get around 7 hours with the tablet and around 10-12 with the dock if you aren't doing anything super strenuous. That is a bit disappointing too if you consider how much battery that gives you with these fairly low powered processors.Heat/Noise: The fans turn on fairly often but unless you are doing something like gaming or some intense web pages you can't hear them very much. The heat is all on the upper half of the tablet so you don't really feel it at all but it does get a bit toasty.Performance: This is where I was kind of let down. I got this to upgrade from my Asus T100 to something more in between notebook and tablet speeds. What I have found out is that in testing this shows decently clear but in real world performance it doesn't show as much.Here is a few benchmarks I ran it is closer to the Ultrabook class processor. It usually doubles the Bay Trail cpu in the benchmarks. Some of them are fairly close like the 3dmark test even though the processor and Graphics are on paper vastly superior.Sunspider 0.91 - 294.3Kraken  -  2270Octane - 129687zip multi thread - 51637zip single thread - 2276GFXbench 2.7 t-rex offscreen - 1372 (25fps)GFXbench 2.7 t-rex onscreen - 1672 (30fps)GFXbench 2.7 egypt offscreen - 5304 (47fps)GFXbench 2.7 egypt onscreen - 5634 (50fps)3dmark - Ice Storm - 17918 (15k on T100)Doing things like loading up web pages, starting up desktop applications, and metro applications were consistently met or beat by my Z3740 powered T100. I tried surfing so more strenuous web pages and anywhere the Atom would hiccup most likely the same would happen with the i5. Also one annoyance about higher powered tablets is they actually go to sleep when you press the power button, so instead of that instant on like most tablets you have to wait until it decides to wake up.Testing out some games was hit or miss if it did good at all. (yes I ran them the same settings and resolution, as well as set the power profile to high performance)League of Legends  Low - Venue: 30-50 fps T100: 30-45 fpsCall of duty black ops- Venue: 20 out of action 11 in action T100: 15 out of action 11 in actionTorchlight - Venue: 60fps  T100: 30fpsEuro Truck 2: roughly both 20-30fps Venue had a slight edgeBastion: Venue: 50fps  T100: 20 fpsDragonage 2: Venue: 30fps T100: 20fpsSo as you can see graphics wise it has an edge but in most games it isn't really much better considering the components should all be close to 2x faster if not more. I'm sure if I were doing things like professional Photoshop editing, video editing, or intense programming I might notice some good speed bumps there but honestly for everything else I'm not sure.Yes I have updated my drivers (even tried some newer ones from intel) So I just am extremely underwhelmed by the performance of the 4210y especially on the Venue 11 pro. I'm not sure if it is something throttling it or what but it just doesn't meet the performance it price would make you think it gives.If you were wanting faster desktop performance, web browsing, hd video viewing, better gaming etc. You are kind of paying twice the price for something that performs the same speed on most situations. While at the same time is heavier, has heat vents (also hotter) , and worse battery. Which just makes this hard to recommend, it's really just a sign of how much atom has caught up and it's a very good thing for that platform.", "Title": "Fairly underwhelming for what you are buying.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R20IDCX46XDJSU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Randomly reboots.  will do this 2-3 times before the computer is actually usable for any significant period of time.

I did a Google search and found this to be a common, ongoing issue with the Venue Pro.  I have used Dell's for years and have never had such disastrous results.  To Dell's credit, they did offer to replace it and give us a $200 refund rather than return it, but my wife was adamant that it go back.Because she wanted something light for everyday use such Facebook games, web browsing and email, today, I ordered her an iPad Air and created her an account on my Dell 17 7737 laptop for other things such as MS Office.", "Title": "Not ready for Prime Time", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Author": "William Baker", "ReviewID": "R1ZPATGVCJNKEB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Will not run much.

Dunbar", "ReviewID": "R2E9OYVS7665MK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had the Venue 11 Pro Baytrail and decided to upgrade to this one.  This tablet had a bunch of problems with Windows, such as being unable to use the system image and the power button did not put the tablet into sleep mode.  If you stick with the factory image, the power button does work, however, clean installing windows will cause this quirk with the tablet.Update: If you dig around in the Dell community forums, there is a link to Intel Virtual Buttons drivers, unfortunately it is not listed on the drivers page.The Baytrail/Atom Tablet did not have these issues because it uses Windows 32 bit.  It is slightly laggy in Office and Websites compared to the i5; however, it is rendering them with adobe flash and running a full version of office.There is an annoying bug with Windows when signing in with the screen in portrait orientation after resetting the computer.  This will cause the screen to blank out.  I believe a Windows update causes this issue and won't occur until you update.  It occurs with any Windows tablet, even the Tegra based ones.Update:  Microsoft finally released an update that fixed this issue...There was build quality issues and I don't like the mesh grills on the side.Update:  If you feel a bulge there is a fastener that will be engaged if you press down and push up slightly that will snap into place.  I was able to get mine to snap in to place.The build quality on Venue 11 Pro Baytrail is much higher and felt real solid with a solid rubbery back.  This tablet did not have that solid feeling and you can feel the back flex in, this might have been designed in to leave that space because of the higher heat output, it does give you a better grip when the back gives in slightly.The Samsung Series 7 slate when I bought it had impeccable build quality and the heat grill was stamped into the metal.

Hayes", "ReviewID": "R3SIKA887HTF7V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Dell Venue 11 Pro sight unseen as there were no local Dell stores or mall kiosks where I could \"test drive\" the unit. As a piece of hardware, it has some things to be liked and some not so much. It is a quality build, but the backing did flex a bit. It is a bit thicker than other tablets, and heavier. The backing does not have good tactile adhesion and as a result, the bigger and heavier unit feels as though it will slip from one's grip. I did not buy a cover/stand for this unit. The processor on this model is the i5-4210y, very responsive and snappy. The touchscreen itself was quite satisfying to use. I never purchased a keyboard. The form factor is a bit wider than the usual tablet 4:3 aspect ratio, and took some getting used to. The big drawback to the unit is the use of Windows 8 (or 8.1). From the moment I powered up, I was barraged by the requirement to create accounts for Microsoft, Xbox Live, McAfee and others. Some I was able to skip. Eventually I got to the \"Start\" page and the iconic tiles. And their tiny print. On the Dell Venue 11 Pro one must deal with things that the tablet hardware controls, and then things that Win 8 controls. It constantly referred to the unit as \"your PC\". I never found a good balance where the type and text looked satisfying and large enough. Some enlargement capabilities do exist, for example tiles can be made larger - but the text remains small! Idiotic!  Suffice to say, Win 8 destroyed any enjoyment the Dell hardware may have offered. In the end, I found myself getting fatigued from trying to hold the unit as a tablet and ended up propping it whenever possible. In sum, this unit has a very good processor, equal to a laptop, and is like a desktop computer in a tablet form factor. It is less a tablet and more a computer, and if paired with a stand/keyboard, will be a good portable, and powerful, computer.", "Title": "Almost But Not Quite", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Author": "Optimistic", "ReviewID": "R19FNC5AADEQH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update: 24 Mar- USB port is hard to remove devices from- Freezing would not go even with the BIOS update- trackpad is still terribleUpdate: 26 Jan 2014- vibration sound when playing video- useless support from Dell and no one answers phone calls.- no constructive feedback from Dell.- there is a long list of people complaining about this laptop.This seriously had made me decide to buy a Mac better than this junk Microsoft brought.Update: 22 Jan 2014If there was a score of minus then I would have scored this product to minus.
