{"Reviews": [{"Author": "S. Snoke", "ReviewID": "R36W0KEJRFHOKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When it comes to deciding on a computer or anything else more than $20 bucks, I tend to be cautious.  Even more so with something close to $500...  I compared the Lenovo to the Ipad, the Acer and Acus models, and finally went with this for the following factors: Most of my international friends trust Lenovo over Acer and Acus.  Also, it has the ability to change batteries, and use USB directly, as well as have a real Keyboard, which isn't a part of Ipad.  And for all the I-pad bells and whistles, its not really all that great for typing. I'm old school. when I'm not typing, my fingers rest on the keys... even occasionally tapping lightly while I'm thinking. On an Ipad, I'll have a whole line of nnnnnnnnnnnn or whatever.when I ordered it, I also got the 2GB upgrade for memory (Kingston) and upgrade package for Windows home premium.  It wasn't all that difficult to upgrade the memory. there's a few micro screws, but it snaps off and back on pretty well. The memory just pops out. And I had no problems upgrading to Home premium Windows 7 using my wireless connection. Again, no problems with that either.Now for the usage.  Its fine for me. The more I get used to the touch screen, the more I wonder how I got around without it.  I'm not perfect with it. There's still the problem of my big finger not hitting the X close button precisely, but combine that with the smaller touch pad's precision, and it's a great combo.The included programs are hit or miss. Natural touch took a little tooling, but I think I have it under control now. and I decided not to use the lenovo ready go program because its full of adware. I just don't need any of it cause I don't use wireless all the time.the keyboard is fine for me, and I hardly notice much difference between it and a full size on my other computer.  Windows 7 seems much easier to use than Vista, so I have less problems finding the program I want easily without using lots of energy on wasted animation.With the 2GB Memory, I have no problem with Kindle, or movies or streaming. I can't exactly play World of Warcraft or other big games, but I didn't buy it for the game potential, but for the word processing and transportation ability.  The 8 cell battery it comes with is a little big, but as another reviewer said, it's a find handle when you use it for a book reader, etc.  I love the long battery life. I can use it off and on, and play videos or type away for hours. For example, my flight from Chicago to Tokyo was 12 hours, and I used it most of the trip for typing, plus I played a video for my daughter, and even a Dora game for her.  Typically, I only need to charge it once every 2 days, and keep it in sleep mode (just shutting the lid) when not in use.I'm sure if you are looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the I-pad which will actually allow you to type something without hurting your neck or your wallet, then this is a great choice.", "Title": "Works as well and better than expected", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Author": "Vikram Rajagopalan \"Vikram\"", "ReviewID": "R2A8NGKBWBIKS2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As soon as Steve Jobs specified what the iPad would be, I was disappointed, and realized that I needed something else to be my touch-screen computer of choice.  I looked first at the Archos 9 PC tablet, but I realized that the touch screen was resistive, would not support multi-touch, and did not have a real keyboard, which was a large downside for schoolwork.  After looking at CES, I found the Lenovo s10-3tWhen I first put this netbook together, I was surprised by the size of the battery- it wasn't as large as people who reviewed it told me it was, but it definitely jetted out of the computer.  Many argue that the keyboard is cheap, but I actually like the way it feels.  Unlike most netbooks, It doesn't feel super-duper small in your hands.  The track pad is ridiculously small compared to most other netbooks in its class.  The two buttons are integrated into the touchpad, but it does not work like the Macbooks, where you can click anywhere on the track pad.  When I plugged it in, the light on the lid of the netbook is not helpful.  It does not indicate when the battery is full, and there is no way to check the level of charge without actively turning on the computer.  IT was also difficult for me to disconnect the charger from the port on the computer.  The netbook has two USB ports, a VGA port, which is useful for connecting to projectors, and an Ethernet port for wired access.Turning on the computer, there were loads of bloatware, as Lenovo does not even let your load Windows without launching all of their software programs.The touchscreen-The multitouch capacitive screen works well.  Turning the screen, rotating the hinge was pretty easy.  However when moving around the laptop with the screen open (in laptop mode) the screen would fall flat backward.  The hinge moved too easily.  This began to concern me.  I have not taken action to call Lenovo about this issue yet.  Most of its capabilities are only available after upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium.  I found a copy of the Anytime Upgrade to Home Premium on EBay for 40 dollars, but otherwise the full cost of the product is 79.99.  The upgrade process takes 10 minutes, and does not affect your files.  Once the upgrade was installed, I was able to pinch, zoom, swipe, rotate and highlight almost any website or window. The raised bezel makes it difficult, however, to click in the corners.  I had some trouble clicking the start button; every time I tried it would load something different from my taskbar.  I fixed the issue by increasing the size of the taskbar, and moving the start button a little higher on the screen.  However this limited my viewing space.  In tablet mode, portrait was uncomfortable, there isn't much room to hold the tablet in this orientation, and although some argue the battery makes a nice handle, it gets in the way. I imagined I could hold the tablet in portrait mode to read eBooks, but the screen is almost too widescreen and the reading space I was left with were extremely narrow.  When holding the tablet in landscape mode, Lenovo did a great job making it easy to hold, to prevent the accidental touch of the power button, they created a hold switch.  This was nice for watching Hulu, or any video.  I found myself loving Aero Snap- I would unmaximize my windows and center them so I could click the X button, closing programs.  The Ribbon UI of the MS Office Suite worked great with the touchscreen, but some programs did not work as well.Anyone who purchases this computer must remember that Windows 7 is a full desktop operating system with features that allow touch, and is not a trapped, compressed Apple-support-only operating system where all of the buttons and everything has been customized to the hardware.As a netbook-The netbook isn't slow.  It isn't super-fast either, it's a netbook.  The processor is pretty fast for an Atom, 1.66 GHz.  When I opened Windows task manager with all of my usual programs open, I found that I was using 82% of my memory.  I purchased 2GB of RAM on EBay for 30 dollars, and I found a significant difference in speed.  Converting to tablet mode became much faster.  Loading, minimizing, and all touchscreen functions became much more responsive.I enabled the Quick Start in the BIOS settings, and enjoyed that functionality, it was speedy, but I kept the netbook on for most of the time, and never used it extensively.OVERVIEWPROS- Great, speedy netbook (with add-on), Quick start Feature, long lasting battery (14 hours, I was able to achieve) Responsive multitouch touchscreen, Wireless N, full size keyboard.CONS- hinge moves too easily, tiny touchscreen, touchscreen loves fingerprints,  horrible speakers ( tinny sound)  have to pay extra for Windows Upgrade.", "Title": "Great litte netbook, impressive touchscreen, great bettery", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Author": "Jonathan Cleary", "ReviewID": "R3GPZQDF4C4X2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best option you have if you want a tablet. Everything works great, and it has so many more features than the iPad will. It is faster and with a built-in keyboard, it makes an awesome little netbook.Basically, no one else will be releasing anything quite like this. If you're on the fence because of that, just go ahead and take the plunge. A \"netvertable\" has taken the backseat to pure tablets. Which is too bad, because the hybrid concept is much more practical. I can take notes on this thing, or even write a quick review for Amazon.With the right codecs, you can push out 720p/1080p on this thing. I have successfully pulled that off with CoreAVC. It is no substitute for Tegra/ION, but in this form factor, no one will be releasing an ION based device this year anyways.Great device, highly recommended. Just be smart with it, upgrade the RAM and get Home Premium. Then you'll be golden.

GB of memory.My overall impression is quite positive given the flexibility of using my existing PC applications and using it as a tablet for reading e-books, surfing the internet, and watching videos. One pleasant surprise is that the wide screen display gives me a much better internet browsing experience than my other existing netbooks. In my opinion, it does a lot more than an iPad with a similar price as its low-end model.The multi-touch experience is not the best but it works quite well after some training.Hope you enjoy this videoCheers", "Title": "Video Review of Lenovo S10-3t", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Author": "D. Cartwright", "ReviewID": "RX705FJ0IAX15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at netbooks for a while in order to have something a little more portable than a laptop and more usable than a smartphone for basic e-reading, email, and web browsing. I was close to buying an iPad when I came across the Lenovo S10-3T. After reading the reviews on both products, I opted for the S10-3T as it seemed to have the functionality and expandability of a netbook, but the touch screen capabilities of an iPad. I have been very pleased with my decision and have found this to be the best of both worlds. Below are the pros and cons which are consistent with what I had read in other reviews -- note I gave this a 5-star review because despite a few cons, I believe it to be the best product on the market today. Also, while some reviews have complained about the battery that sticks out, I have found it to be quite handy for holding when in tablet mode.Pros:* Touchscreen* Fast* Intel platform (can support multiple OSes)* Expandable - USB (wireless broadband, printer, external drive, etc.), SD Reader, memory* Near full-size keyboard (for times when you have a bit of typing to do)Cons:* Windows 7 Starter -- this is a functional OS and probably could have gotten by with it, but wanted something a little more configurable -- upgraded to Home Premium* The pre-installed software is more than the configured memory adequately supports -- either remove some of it or add more memory.* Somewhat heavy for one-handed holding (this is going to be the case of any of these type of devices unless you want just an eReader).There are a number of sites which have some good tips for configuring this device. I found the [...] site to be very helpful -- thank you Jesse for the info.", "Title": "Great Netbook / Tablet", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Author": "AnnetteK", "ReviewID": "R2VFRYJC2RSBL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Bottom Line:  For the way I use a computer, this one isn't perfect, but it's pretty close.  It takes some upgrading and tweaking to get it working just right and if you aren't willing to spend some time doing this you are likely to be disappointed.  If you are willing to make the investment, this computer is a gem!The details (long):Here is what I use my computer for:  I spend a fair amount of time on-line.  I do quite a lot of text entry, both on-line and on a word processor.  I do all my personal finances, using Quicken.  And I interact with several USB  devices.  I do not do games or compute-intensive work.Here is how I use my computer:  I use it as a portable, around the house.  I move from location to location, room to room, out on the patio, whatever.  I never use a mouse, because that impedes my desire for portability.  We do quite a bit over-the-road traveling, and I take my computer on the road.  Portability is very important to me.My current computer is an entry level Sony laptop.  Six pounds.  15.4\" screen.  Two hour battery charge.  Decent keyboard, decent touchpad, nice screen, adequate performance.  It gets the job done, but is far from ideal.  Recently, in a hotel room, I got the power cord tangled on a piece of furniture and dropped the device onto a carpeted floor.  Fortunately, and surprisingly, the computer survived, intact.  But this was the last straw.What I would like in a computer is something that is very small and lightweight that will handle all the general computer work I do (I want ONE computer), and will have a battery that lasts long enough so that all I have to do is plug it in over night.  Also, I have always wanted to able to drive down the road and be able to connect to the internet as we are traveling.The iPad caught my attention.  This would be a perfect device for a person like me, if it can do my job.  Unfortunately, after studying the device, I found a number of shortcomings that I can't live with, such as the lack of a physical keyboard, no USB ports, no Flash support, a cell phone operating system, etc.  The wide band cellular data plans, $15 and $30/month with no contract, would be perfect for me for travel.In evaluating the iPad, I came across the Lenovo S10-3T, and looked closely, and bought one from Amazon.  I've had it a week.  Here is my experience to date:My first, and key, point is that if you want a computer that works just right, straight out of the box, you probably aren't going to be very happy with this computer.  This one seems to work best with some upgrading and tweaking, an investment I was ready to perform in order to get what I want. If you aren't willing to make the investment, you might wind up like the recent reviewer here who thought that there is no on-screen keyboard in tablet mode, and sent it back (there is an on-screen keyboard, and it's fine, and you have a lot of control over it, but you have to invest the time to find it and learn how to control it).Amazon Prime is great.  I ordered the netbook, the 2gb memory upgrade, and the System 7 Anytime upgrade to Home Premium from Starter, and I had it all with free shipping in two days.There is an Amazon review of this device by Jesse Andersen.  I read this review particularly closely, as Mr. Andersen clearly has done a ton of work with the S10-3T and has documented his work and findings in detail.  Look at his review.  And mostly, look at his web site, which he links you to in one of the comments attached to the review.The touch screen was sluggish, out of the box, so I did what Mr. Andersen and others recommend.  I removed bloatware, and upgraded the operating system and the DRAM.  I also went to Jesse's web site and did a lot of the tips he suggests.  This helped a lot, but it still isn't perfect, and I'll comment in a bit.I'm a Chrome user.  Chrome lacks touch screen support, so I had to abandon it.  I have never liked Explorer, and Safari seems to always bog down on me.  Firefox has always been my second choice, and it's the best browser for this system, as it has good touch screen support and add-ons that help even more.  I couldn't do side-to-side finger scrolling on the touch screen, but the \"Grab and Drag\" Firefox add-on solved that problem and made the entire touch screen experience better.  I think this is the most important add-on.  All of this is covered in Mr. Andersen's tips.April 30, 2010 Update:  Firefox add-ons:  I already noted that \"Grab and Drag\" is an important add-on.  I want to say that \"Flashblock\" is also a key add-on.  The touch screen responds much better for web surfing on many sites with Flashblock installed.July 6, 2010 Update:  I miss Chrome.  I found a Chrome extension that supports touchscreen functions.  I am now using Chrome again.  It is great, so much faster than Firefox, and the touchscreen is more responsive.  Chrome is nice for the small screen, because it is a cleaner screen interface.  Also, when you hit F11 and go to full screen, you actually get full screen(!).  Further, you can eliminate the side scroll bars, using an option in the touchscreen extension.  Also, text editing, cut/copy and paste, and the like are more intuitive.  I haven't found anything I can't do with Chrome.  Perhaps you can do all of what I just described with Firefox, but I never found it.  Try Chrome and the touchscreen extension!Overall, the resulting system satisfies every one of my wants and needs, except one, which is the broad band cellular capability.Here are some specific comments:I am a pretty fair typist, and I have always loved IBM keyboards.  Lenovo has retained the IBM keyboard style, and I can power type on this keyboard better than any full sized Sony or Toshiba laptop keyboard I've ever used.  It's really good, and this is very important to me.The touch pad is not very good, compared to a full sized laptop.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that you hardly use it, given the touch screen!!The internal speakers live up everything stated elsewhere - they are terrible.  But I knew this going in, and I am ordering Bluetooth headphones.  The computer has Dolby sound, so headphone sound should be great.  NOTE:  If somebody out there can tell me how to order and install an internal Bluetooth adapter, so that I don't have to use a USB port for a dongle, I would really appreciate it!Screen size:  very small compared to my 15.4\" Sony screen.  But there are a ton of tricks you can play with hidden task bars et al to maximize the effective size of the screen. I have gotten used to the size of the screen, and the speed and convenience of touch, and I don't miss the bigger screen at all, after only a week.Touch screen:  It is so great for the internet.  I just love it.  I hardly ever use the touch pad.  I know that in time I will become even more proficient, and learn new tricks and techniques, too.  I am sure I will never go back to a non-touch screen computer.Touch screen performance:  Very good, actually, but not always perfect.  Scrolling gets sticky from time to time.  Things that make it sticky seem to be dense graphics and text on a page, numerous open tabs in Firefox, and numerous open applications.  If the screen gets a little sticky when I am looking at dense, small text and lots of graphics, like a news page, I just make things a little bigger.  And if I keep the Firefox tabs and open applications to a minimum, there are absolutely no worries.  Touch screen performance is not a problem for me, but it's not perfect.  Edit:  I checked my startup applications, and found a large number of things I don't use.  I disabled them, and touch screen performance is now smooth under nearly all conditions.Battery:  It must last 5 or more hours (8 cell).  Plenty for me.  I charge overnight.General performance:  Surprisingly good.  I have had no noticeable problems with my work, but again, I don't do a lot of compute-intensive things.  I run Norton Internet Security 2010.  This is not your grandfather's Norton.  The new Norton doesn't slow you down, and you hardly know you have it except for when you need it because it's caught something.Tablet mode:  I don't do any stylus things, but I do use it when I am sitting in certain positions, and it's very useful and I'm happy to have it.Wide Band Cellular:  Nothing available that is comparable to the AT&T; offerings for the iPad.  You can get excellent national coverage with a two year Verizon plan for $60/month.  No thanks.  I'll bet that, given the AT&T; support for the iPad, there will be attractive plans soon for the PC world.I have had one problem.  I have a 60 GB USB hard drive.  It won't work.  It's a driver problem.  The drivers are in a Lenovo folder, so I called Lenovo.  They answered right away, and worked with me for quite some time, then we got \"accidentally\" disconnected.  I never called back.  The hard drive still doesn't work.  This is a minor issue, and I'll get it fixed later.  I wasn't happy to get disconnected, but I was pleased that I got through so easily to Lenovo, and that there was a good spirit of helpfulness.", "Title": "It's All I Need in a Computer!", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Author": "Shore Tactical", "ReviewID": "R18URGSMMG1HP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey playing right now on my lenovo s10-3t.

The best thing to do is to open your computer and do a pin count on your RAM.  If the gap where the gold pins are is near the middle or an inch from the RAM edge, then you need a 204-pin 2GB RAM DDR3, if the gap is less than that to the edge (perhaps 3/4 of an inch) then you need a 200-pin 2GB RAM DDR2.

When the S12 began to show signs of wear (I constantly use it, so that is normal) I began on my replacement journey.  When looking at replacing the netbook and passing the S12 on to the kids (which still works great), I knew I wanted another netbook, but I wanted the flexibility of a tablet or a computer with a touch screen.Honestly, having a reputable, affordable touchscreen were my only real requirements for the replacement.  I looked at various models; HP 5102 and HP 5103 and the Asus EEE PC T101. I also looked at larger 12\" and 11\" models, but did compromise on the 12\" screen which i have with the Lenovo s12 with the S10 3t.I went back an forth from reading reviews here, on pcmagazine.com, computershopping.com, watching youtube video's etc,. but I kept coming back to the Lenovo.  Although I was not pleased with Lenovo's customer service, I did like the features and reviews of this tablet convertible. This time I decided to purchase a warranty with Square Trade, as I read their reviews and I have a friend who recently used her policy and they granted her a refund when her insured netbook failed.I recently purchased my model here on Amazon from a seller in the market.  I paid $310 + $15 expedited shipping for it she had only used it for 6 months and it is still under warranty (for what that's probably worth) It came with Windows Premium and it was upgraded to 2 gb even though it was erroneously listed as only having the 8 cell battery (which it did not) lol, but getting the other unmentioned upgrades softened the disappointment...a lot.My reservations stemmed from reading on a Lenovo forum that there was a problem with screens cracking, and the company pretty much would not replace the screens without expense of about $250, but I found this was true on most of the tablets, so you have to be careful.  And since I tend not to be that careful, I was seriously looking at the HP touch screen stationary models because of this concern. (FYI; You can also get a drop and spill provision with Square trade insurance)I did not give it 5 stars because I really felt that Lenovo should have sold the unit with Windows Premium.  I have become more comfortable with the learning curve as I have taken advantage of jessebanderson.com Lenovo s10 3t website with all of his awesome videos, articles and tips.  Hubpages.com is also a good place for S10 information.This model is one of those computers that need to be personalized and tweaked to run optimized.  When I got the unit I deleted Veriface, Veritouch, McAfee and some other extranious programs that I did not want to use or to inhibit the quick login or space. (I downloaded recommended lite weight Panda Cloud, a free antivirus program) although I can use Norton free with my comcast account.Pro's:1. I totally LOVE the flexibility of this computer!  I can use it in tradition netbook mode, flip it down to tablet or have tablet flipped and half open with keyboard facing outward.2. Feature rich, I have not begun to totally tap into the options and abilities of this computer.3.  Keyboard(s) I like the standard keyboard that comes with it and the chicklet type design.  The onboard keyboard is nice and comes in regular as well as reduced size for easy entry when in tablet mode.4.  Computer standby and hibernation mode and it works! I hope it continues to work as I seldom turn off my cpu, I love how I hit the power button and it returns me to my screen and saves battery life.5.  Affordability!  There are several models on the market, but thanks to Amazon market and Ebay, you can snag a good model reasonably priced.6. iPad = haha.  I know someone who has an iPad and it has a great screen, resolution and very portable, but that's about it to me.  No usb ports, no card reader and this is important to me since I'm a photography enthusist.  I wanted something that was not limiting as the ipad is.7. The build of the computer is really nice and solid feeling to me.  It has this iconic graphics inset at the base of the keypad which is translucent.Cons:1. When ppl said the speakers suck, believe them.  I thought since I have another Lenovo, how much quieter can it be. Well it is low on sound, but that's not why I bought it, plus I have an external usb bar speaker for a louder room.2. Touchpad.  Personally, i do not like the textured keypad.  I spend so much time on the computer, i find it too rough to my sensitive fingers and I prefer the smooth glass type style keypad.3. The unit really should have come with standard 2 gb, and especially an upgraded OS, since you cannot utilize the touchscreen without the upgrade.4. My Customer service experience was a joke.  The last couple of times I called Lenovo customer service with my s10, it was a TOTAL WASTE of time.  I honestly felt that their job was to do nothing and have me wait out my warranty.5.  Although the Amazon listing says it comes with 250 gb internal memory, it is partially partitioned to backup to the D drive, so it is not all 250 on the C drive, which I was expecting. Mines has 187 gb on the C drive and the remainder on the D drive for the backup.

However, before I sent it back I did play with it for a few hours.At first the machine was *incredibly* slow to respond, touches registered more than a second late, or not at all. I assumed that this was due to a poor quality screen, but after replacing McAfee with avast anti-virus, touches registered properly.The physical design is the worst part of this however. Here are some reasons why.* The S10-3t is built with a recessed screen, presumably to protect it from scratches. However, this ends up with your finger not being able to touch the edges of the screen. This means that, if a window (like your internet browser or a PDF) is maximized, you CANNOT touch the scroll bar to navigate through your document. The only way to do so is to open the netbook to get to the touchpad to navigate. Since this is Windows 7, and not an OS like the iPad which is designed for touch, you *have* to get to this unreachable scroll bar to scroll through documents.* Lenovo attempted to compensate for the above point by making it so that the \"Lenovo touch interface\" listed above launches when the monitor is snapped into tablet mode. But this software crashes if other programs (tested with MSN Messenger, Adobe Reader, and Google Talk) are open in the background. When it did work, it was slow to respond, and missed several touches and gestures, even after uninstalling McAfee. It also doesn't do web browsing itself, or eBook reading, instead launching the default programs for both. This then leaves you back at the first bullet point mentioned above.* The monitor is supposed to rotate and snap into a \"channel\" when in laptop mode. In this channel that is designed to hold the screen in laptop mode, there are two plastic/rubber guides that are supposed to allow this to rotate smoothly at the proper angle. Both of these popped off the third time I rotated the monitor. Without these the monitor does not stay in place in laptop mode.* (Minor Complaint) The track pad on this tablet I believe is Lenovo's standard netbook design. The buttons for left and right click are part of the track pad surface. Since this track pad allows multitouch, if you're like me and tend to leave your finger on the mouse button, your cursor will be constantly jumping to the lower left part of the screen.* (Minor Complaint) The adverting makes a big deal of multitouch, it's even selected as one of the default tags in this review. However, unless you find yourself zooming in and out on web pages a great deal, its functionally useless in a Windows 7 environment.

Sure, you can upgrade but I think Lenovo should have thought it through before shipping it--what good is a multi-touch tablet if you can't use the multi-touch functionality outside of the small, slow software created just for this machine?Second, I think Lenovo made a sacrifice in the overall quality of the machine in order to bring the cost of the touchscreen to average consumers.  I have a Lenovo S10-2 and I love it--I'm fully aware that Lenovo is capable of producing a reasonably-priced netbook that is high quality.  Comparing the S10-3t to the S10-2, I'm sad to see a dramatic decline in the quality of the smaller things like the keyboard (noisy, loose, rattling) and the speakers (tin can and string quality).Third, the battery is a little nuts.  It has to weigh at least two pounds and it knocks the laptop off balance in strange ways.  It juts out like a diving board weights nearly as much as the computer itself.  I will admit that the 10+ hours of battery life is impressive and very useful... but not for me.Finally, the capacitive touchscreen simply did not do what I wanted and the dimensions are a little wonky.  Rumors were that the S10-3t would have a digitized overlay and ship with a stylus and, obviously, it does not.  It's fun for Paint but unfeasible for any kind of note-taking requiring even the slightest amount of detail.  With such a small screen (and zero Windows-tablet functionality), even my considerably small fingers were a difficult interface.  As for the dimensions, this is not a 16:9 10.1\" widescreen--it's a little wider and a little more squat.  Screen real estate is already a valuable commodity on such a little machine, screwing with the dimensions further complicates matters when you're rotating from portrait to landscape and etc.  Of course, there are a slew of tricks to maximize screen real estate in various operating systems but, for all of its flaws, none seemed with it for this machine.But that's just me.", "Title": "Maybe this is what you want", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Author": "bluebirdjohnson7", "ReviewID": "R370FT89AKCYJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this netbook a few years ago and absolutely love it.

The laptop was still in new-like condition, besides the battery may be a little bad? (I can only get it to last about five hours)I recommend installing 2GB of ram and installing a clean version of Windows 7 Ultimate or Home.After doing so, the laptop runs very fast, touch screen and multi touch works great.Of course due to the processor it isn't typically made for playing games or archiving files but it gets the job done for most simple things.The keyboard takes a little bit to get used to, the laptop has a lock switch so pushing the power button won't turn it off. (I found this very handy)The touch pad will annoy you at first, but I have finally gotten used to it.Lenovo has many software programs that are useful and are optional to have.The laptop also has 3 buttons next to the screen for rotating, starting the Lenovo Natural Touch program and muting the sound.To get the full touch experience I installed safari, which seems to work well.The laptop doesn't come with an internal dvd drive you so will want to by an external usb powered dvd drive.Overall:Touch screen works great after installing a clean Windows 7. 2GB of ram is recommended. Touch pad / keyboard take a little bit to get use to. Battery life is average (compared to an iPad) The only problem I have had would be finding the correct drivers and getting them to work properly.

It's certainly small enough to fit in along with a small backpack or messenger bag.  The operating system and tablet functionality is very handy for most situations.  Overall, an outstanding computer for the person on the go!But, as with most things, a few caveats.  First, it comes with Windows 7 Starter installed.  The only issue that I have with that is that there are some functions of the OS that aren't available.  The most noticeable, for me at least, was the fact that you cannot change the desktop background.  I understand that it has this version of Windows installed because the computer's hardware is just above what's needed to run Windows 7, but still an annoyance if nothing else.  The update to Windows 7 Home is about $80, but I don't know yet if the improved features will outweigh the price and possible increased demand on the already taxed CPU resources.  Secondly, the desktop can get rather cluttered if you have more than a half dozen icons on it.  But there are several ways to work around that.  Thirdly, there is no CD drive.  If you fortunate enough to have an external drive that you can use (e.g. DVD burner), this isn't an issue.  There simply isn't room in the case for a CD drive.  It has all of the other usual peripheral ports (USB ports, SD card slot, audio out jack, and a built-in camera).  Finally, the touchscreen functionality is very user-friendly, but is a little difficult to use right near the edges and corners.  For closing maximized windows, for example, it's better to direct the cursor via the mousepad.For me, none of these things was enough to discourage me from getting this fine piece of computing awesomeness!
