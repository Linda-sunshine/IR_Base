I've sent in a return request and I received info about the keyboard not the tablet.  This was definitely my first disappointing purchase from amazon.There is also a front camera which I completely misunderstood.  I take pictures of my products and services, not myself and there's no way to look thru a lens on the back of the camera to use the front camera. Didn't  get that feature at all!Finally, too much of a delay in changing screens, even with the best wifi or data connection.
