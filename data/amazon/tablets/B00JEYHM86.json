Packaged well and even gift wrapped so you could just slap a bow on it if giving it as a gift, but I bought for myself. Note pad works well so far and has a good quality feel to it. Best thing about the product is how cheap it is. I can not believe how well it works for the price I paid !!!  I did not even pay anything for shipping and ordered it last Thursday and it arrived 4 days later on Monday, which was several days earlier than advertised. Very happy with this supplier and Amazon on this purchase.", "Title": "Tablet incredible price", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jonathan Guo", "ReviewID": "R3P5AEVNIKZE2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product for such low prices.
