{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RE30QW21E0VBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated Review: April 23, 2014 - For getting close to 1 3/4 years now, I have been totally enjoying this excellent Tab 2 10.1 WiFi tablet and I continue use this very dependable tablet for hours each day---it has never failed me and still runs like a champ! Since I am a techie, I tested this tablet thoroughly and I have found it to be excellent for my everyday basic computer functions at home and on the road. And it is much easier to travel with than my heavy laptop. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding the Tab 2 10.1 WiFi model. Last August, 2013, I updated to 4.2.2 as it has many improvements and my tablet is running perfectly and it is up to date. The update did remove the screenshot, however, I use the Power Key and Volume key and this takes a screenshot when needed.* Update sent by Samsung today December 14, 2013 - Just updated today my Tab 2 10.1 via the OTA (Over the Air) directly on the Tab itself. The update is not that large at 65MB and just took about 15 minutes from the downloading of the update to the re-booting and installing the updates into the tablet. Samsung is rolling out this update now to improve stability and improve the features on the Tab as it updates the 4.2.2 original update.Result I found after this update 12.14.13: WiFi working great, Amazon Videos loading and playing wonderfully. (I just double click the center of the Amazon Video for full screen). Also tried the camera and several apps and so happy to report that the Tab 2 is running smoother and faster since this update.PROS:- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - What a great feature! It is set to accept up to 32g SD, however, you can add a 64gb SD card, however, you will have to format it inside the Tab 2 and it will then be ready to add files. For me, I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area.- WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. What I discovered: The Tab 2 connected very quickly to my home router and has a high rate of speed no matter where I am located in my home (of course the closer to the router, the faster). Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other tablets before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed over WiFi as the Tab 2. **Newest observation--Today, I tested ALL my WiFi devices (phones and Tablets) and discovered this: Using my home router I noticed that the Tab 2's that I own (7 inch and 10.1 ones), connected faster and have far greater distance to my router than even my Android phone did as it seems to have the HIGHEST signal strength and longest WiFi distance). Then I took the Tab 2 outside and even in my back yard (furthest from router), still got a signal, moved in to back porch and got a very good signal. The same holds true when I travel, I am able to connect to many free WiFi hotspots, easily with great signal strength.- Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser and installed archived flash so I have great internet flash video viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline. Even TODAY after almost ten months of ownership, I still enjoy using this tablet for viewing internet pages, videos and more.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.- Printing Using the Tab 2 - Yes, even with my older home printer, I print documents, photos, etc that are on my Tab 2 using the app Cloud Print and PrinterShare Mobile (both free from Playstore. In addition, there are many apps in the Playstore that will allow you to print using the Tab 2. (If you have questions about printing using the Tab 2 or any question, please ask in the comment section and I will answer).- Watching Online Flash Videos Directly From Maxthon Browser (regular one not the tablet one is best) - If archived flash is installed and Maxthon Browser or other good browsers, I can play videos online. All videos I have tried have played just fine. ***Please ask me in the comments if you need more details regarding watching online videos of any kind on the Tab 2 and also instructions on archived flash,etc...- Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).- Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!**** SUGGESTION: If love watching videos and listening to music, may I suggest that you invest in a Bluetooth Speaker. There are many out there on Amazon most are OK and many low it cost. However, for me I use the EasyAcc Second Gen Bluetooth that Amazon sells and the sound is SUPERB! Also, it plays stand alone SD card music and Flash Drive music as it has the ports for that (the Flash drive and LARGE STANDARD SD cards play directly from the ports the music as stored on the Flash drive of SD CARD).- Battery Life-  Excellent! This is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least 8-12 hours using the tablet before I charge it (depending on how long my WiFi is connected).- OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 2). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 2 because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab 2 and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 2 and from Tab 2 to PC--what a time-saver.- On-Screen Keyboard - For me, I prefer to use the large keys on the on-screen keyboard so this one is PERFECT for me to type on. However, there are many great Bluetooth keyboards out there for the Tab2.- The tablet is very well constructed, however, to secure it better, I bought from Amazon a MoKo adjustable stand/case that I set it up in landscape mode and it has 3 positions.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there are many great Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab2. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB2 10.1).- SPECIAL FREE OUTSTANDING APPS I SUGGEST FROM THE PLAYSTORE:* Pocket App (This is a must app you can \"save to\" Pocket and read text later when offline so you can read text articles (you must be online to watch videos or view pictures however).* Cloud Print and PrinterShare Mobile (both free lets you print right from your tablet).* TV SHOW APP (free) is US TV & Radio Free and also get TV Guide app to go with this. This is an app that lets you watch many TV shows (but they are live so you will need TV Guide app to see what is on). These apps I have tried and the tablet plays the shows wonderfully in full screen. This app also has great radio stations on it. (Note that this app is HUGE almost 33MB but you can watch most cable TV shows on it LIVE).* Netflix (free in Playstore), You really need this app if you plan on watching Netflix using this tablet.  * Hulu Plus, I recommend for movies and more.* TV.COM - gets SOME TV shows and some networks, but you can watch pre-recorded shows.Also great FREE apps: WiFi Analyzer (lets you know how strong your WiFi is), QQ Player, QuickPic (better than the Gallery), Maxthon Browser, AVG Antivirus Free, and I list more in comment section.- Wonderful Kindle Android App is pre-installed, and I downloaded several Kindle books with no problems. Kindle loads fast and this Tablet is a joy to read a book on either Kindle or any eBook or PDF booklet.CONS: (Just one con I found, however, this con is NOT the fault of Samsung)- New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos.*****Update August 30, 2013 ***** There is an AUTO UPDATE for the new OS that will be starting up the next time you turn on WiFi or very soon. It is best that you are aware that you MUST has at least 60% battery, or better yet 100% battery as this update takes up LOTS of space and take a long time to complete. (You can also turn off the auto update to prevent this from happening). Note that the update removes your soft key for the Screenshot and moves the soft keys into the center and lots of other changes. So you may want to take a look at the comment section as there is quite a bit posted these on this)...Bottom line: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes I certainly would, in a heartbeat! So if you are looking for a superb Samsung 10.1 inch tablet and you have great access to WiFi, this is the one to buy. Also, since I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.And also, we have a great discussion going in the comments. Should you have any questions, ask anytime and I will answer right away.", "Title": "Samsung Tab 2 10.1 WiFi - Very Detailed Review On The Many Excellent Features Of This Tablet.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "RHZKD6J2W0OMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a month and am still loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.It is now the end of June 2013.  I have had my Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet for maybe 8 months.  I STILL love it.  I have traveled with it and it has done WELL.  I am surprised that some reviewers have problems with battery life.  I can use it CONTINUOUSLY for a whole waking day without needing to recharge!One comment of IMPORTANCE regarding Samsung customer service.  Unlike Apple, Samsung, at least at present, will provide technical support for free as long as you own the product.  AND, their tech support is SUPERB.  I just shot some videos with my Canon T3i and transferred them (easily, via Samsung USB cable) to the 32 GB micro SD card I bought for the tablet.  They are .mov files.  I was UNABLE to play them on the tablet, although they played well on my PC.  I called Samsung.  After a brief time for research, their techie told me that the Galaxy tablet does not come with an .mov player.  BUT, he directed me to the Google Play Store where I found a number of FREE apps to do the job.  After trying five, I settled on one that played both video and sound smoothly and in real time.Try calling Apple and asking a question 8-9 months after buying an iPad!  They'll charge you $63 for an answer that you might not be able to understand!!!", "Title": "With ONE Caveat, I HIGHLY recommend this Tablet.  This review covers many brands and models.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "Z. Falborn", "ReviewID": "RVYTZE2Q7L5JC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When buying this tablet, keep this in mind;  this is brand new but still old.  Brand new in that it comes with the newest operating system factory installed and Samsung changed some of the specs to put a #2 next to the tablet name.  This is old based on the fact that Samsung scraped a few design features off the original tablet to sell this one at a cheaper price tag.  As of the first week of this tablet's release i have yet to find any downloadable software that would enable me to play movies on it(besides Google's play store of course).  At this point tablets of this size are meant for entertainment; do not see how this is going to entertain someone when the only way to view videos is by already having them in the acceptable format or buying the them again from Google's store.You cannot currently download the application HBO-go, Hulu+ is still not supported, and Amazon's streaming is still unsupported (all due at the moment to the flash support).  So until they come up with the patch work to support streaming i wouldn't buy this tablet.Yes, you can view websites.  Music sounds great.  YouTube is cool to watch clips of people doing strange things while eating your breakfast. Its nice to review my photos on a lightweight screen while sitting in bed.This tablet will be AMAZING for the price point that it is when they fix the support issues. I would have thought this to been taken care of before the release date.**Update** (June 24, 2012)For the most part this tablet has been updated and can do exactly what you want it to.  Hulu+ now works.  Streaming Amazon.com's movies is great. HBO-go is still a no go. Accessories are getting better for the most part.  Software overall has been updated to work out the kinks and I WOULD TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS TABLET for someone that does not want to go the Ipad route.***Update 2*** (November 4, 2012)This tablet has been going strong  battery life is still what it was when i bought it on the release date. The app store now carries the HBO GO app so my game of thrones addiction will continue whenever I'm not at home.  Video viewing programs continue to come out on the store as well, adding to your viewing experience with this tablet.", "Title": "Careful", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3SFK4ZAPXFNQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Part of my job is to evaluate media streaming hardware for an entertainment company. In the last few weeks I've acquired an iPad 2, Kindle Fire and this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 to test and evaluate. I also own the original Droid Incredible, which is where my android experience comes from. These are the devices I'll be comparing this device to.Let me start off by saying I really wanted to love this thing. I've been an android user for a couple years and thought that it would translate well to the tablet environment. While there are some nice things, it really lacks is most departments. After a week of using the device, this is what I found.THE GOOD-The device itself looks and feels nice in your hands, even with the plastic back.-Front facing stereo speakers are a nice addition, unlike the other tablets I've seen.-Battery life seems decent so far. Hits about 9 hours, which is an hour longer than the Kindle Fire, but still short of the iPad 2.-Peel's universal remote app is very cool since the device has an IR blaster. Setup was easy with no remote codes to enter. It worked with my Samsung TV (obviously), DirecTV DVR and Sony sound-bar.THE BAD-Unfortunately, this device is barely an upgrade from the previous version. Many of the specs are the same if not worse than the original Galaxy Tab 10.1.-Compared to similarly priced tabs (iPad 2 $399, ASUS Transformer Pad TF300 $379, Acer Iconia Tab A510 $450, Acer Iconia Tab A200 $350) it does not fare well in any of the benchmark tests, even compared to the original. Check the Engadget review for details.-The cameras are pretty horrible and they've removed the LED flash from the back of the previous version. They're still serviceable for Skype and Google video chat.-The display is not nearly as responsive as the iPad 2, Kindle Fire or Droid Incredible. I found myself pressing much harder than i was used to.-Even when my tap was registered, it sometimes took a second or two for the tablet to react. Just not as snappy as you want it to be.-Certain apps DO NOT work on the device (HBO Go, Hulu), others have reduced functionality (MLB At Bat Lite and DirecTV do not stream video)-Oddly, while the device uses micro USB to charge, it does not register as charging when plugged into a computer. It will still charge very slowly, but will take more than twice as long. You need to use the proprietary USB wall adapter that comes with the device for it to charge properly.THE NOTEWORTHY-On the bottom dock you're given 4 soft keys: back, home, app switcher and screenshot. The screen shot button is furthest out from the edge and ends up getting hit often enough to make you wonder why they included it at all. I personally can't think of a reason to take a screenshot of my tab desktop.-The Samsung Hubs for Games, Media and Music are interesting if you feel like paying for extra content, but much like the other bloatware included, you could live without them.-It does not sync with my Mac Mini or Mac Pro when attached by USB. I've been using the included version of dropbox for all file transfers, so this is not a huge deal.When all 3 devices arrived, I expected to rank the Galaxy Tab first, then iPad, then Kindle Fire. That's all changed. The Kindle Fire is by far the most enjoyable experience even though it lacks some of the functionality of the other 2. It's followed by the iPad 2 and then this one.The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is a strange product. It seems like Samsung was trying to reposition the device away from the new iPad by dropping the price and not giving it huge upgrades. In doing so, it's been exposed it to another tougher group of tablets and it doesn't fare well. For the same price you can get any number of tabs that are sure to give you a better experience.EDIT (10/7/12):After initially testing the Tab, I set it down for a couple months. A few weeks ago I read about the amazing update it had received (4.0.4) and decided to give it another shot. There have been dramatic improvements in the responsiveness and overall speed of the device.While MLB At Bat still had issues streaming games, Hulu and HBOGo work like a dream now. In addition to those two streaming apps, there are tons of new video apps which allow you to stream authenticated content (TBS, TNT, CW, Adult Swim, Epix, etc.). One app that I've discovered since the upgrade has really helped change my mind about this device. UTorrent is now available through Google Play on this device. It's a fully functioning Bit Torrent client. You can download any torrent files directly to your device and play audio and video without any issues.One of my biggest original pet peeves has also been remedied. You can now reset the Quick Launch soft key (originally screen capture) to launch an app, search, camera, or disabled.The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is greatly improved. I still have issues with certain aspects (charging, Mac sync, camera quality), but they're almost outweighed by the new features. Apparently it will receive another upgrade to Android 4.1 in the near future, which will make it even more enticing. If you can find a cheaper, refurbished version (since it's been usurped by the Galaxy Note 10.1) I would highly recommend this device.", "Title": "Just not there yet. Maybe one day... EDIT (Huge software improvements!)", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Antoine G", "ReviewID": "R32TKF1QO81PD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi folks. My 2 cents and some.  I own an iPad, the Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 and an HTC Inspire with the SPB 3DShell on both android units so i do have a half way decent perspective on tablets and Androids in general.  I did my homework and read all the specs on the Samsung 2 10.1.s  I must say that I am disappointed at many of the reviews especially on Youtube.  One of the best and most accurate review was from the AndroidAuthority guys.  If I had listened to most of the others I probably not purchased this unit. Some of them should be ashamed of themselves for flat out lying.  It is a spectacular deal for the money.  The SG 2 7.0 with the same specs is not the same tablet with respect to the sharpness and brightness of the screen, performance,and even how some of the software presents.  The \"lag\" between screens swipe with touchwiz as your home screens is probably by design to show \"smoothness\" as you go from screen to screen.If you have Go launcher or what I have, SPB 3dShell you won't have that slow transition. I installed SPB 3DShell and swiping is instantaneous. And I haven't even rooted my device...yet.  I also installed go launcher along with some of their themes and it is as smooth as silk.  You can switch between launchers if you wish to compare how they perform and decide which you like best.  PS. Go launcher is free and so are most of its themes.  I have watched movies on this thing and they are absolutely beautiful.  Great detail, color and no lag or stuttering whatsoever.  I mean movies like Avatar and Green Lantern!  Surfing is joy with smooth pinching, scrolling and no problem with Adobe flash as far as I can tell.  By the way just google Adobe Flash player and you can still get it even though adobe says they aren't supporting it going forward...at least for now.It feels very good in your hand and I purchased the samsung slim hardcase and it is one handsome machine all dressed up.  My apps fly on this thing however if you're a gamer who likes flight sims and anything really graphically intensive you'd probably need a faster processor.  Asus, Acer or Toshiba come to mind.  This is what Samsung intended it for, entertainment, surfing, business apps and some gaming and ebook reading.  They have the Galaxy Note 10.1 with quadcore processor and 2 gigs of ram if you want the Galaxy and gaming experience for $100 bucks more.I didn't get the above for various \"review\" reasons, Asus with screen popout problems, Acer with the hotspot problem and Toshiba with the so called light bleed problem.  To be honest if I hadn't purchase the Samsung and ignored the lightbleed complaints and I would have bought the Toshiba.  I might have prefered the better quality build of the Toshiba with Gorilla Glass and it's sleek design. And to add insult to injury, a company which shall go nameless is sell the Excite 10 for $30 less than the Samsung.  Never the less, after looking at the Samsung display and seeing how clear and natural the colors were,along with very good performance, I am very pleased with my Samsung 2 10.1.  I can see the better quality in some of the software as it presents along with a better screen than its 7 inch little brother.  It aint an Amoled or retina display but if you haven't been using those it won't make much of a difference.  The amoled displays can look a bit cartoony at times due to the color saturation but they are beautiful and good for reading.  The retina is simply gorgeous.  I just like the Android tablet experience better and Samsung does not disappoint.  My next will be the new Galaxy Note and I will sell my 7in and my phone and just have the 2 along with the iPad.  The iPad too has it's pluses and minuses.  But the build quality on it is exceptional and the standard to which every other company compares to. PS.I am no Apple fan, just stating the facts.  I use my androids far more that my apple thingy  I just wish folks were more truthful with their reviews so that we lowly consumers can make educated decisions when we buy technical items like tablets and phones.  I am also a former director of IT for a large medical group and know a little something about how things should perform based on price/performance ratios.  In this device you get a little more than what you pay for imo.Why is a dual core processor able to compete with Tegra 3's in common usage like web surfing, switching between apps etc adn even best some of them? Stupid speed tests be hanged.  Show real world experience.  That's how most of us understand what the heck these techies are saying. And you don't hear of some of the above mentioned problems with the Samsung either.  Just lies about lag, dull screen, \"pore performance\" yada, yada yada.  I'm no Samsung loyalist either, but some of the touchwiz experience works for me and probably for most users who either have never experienced Android in its various forms or find vanilla Icecream Sandwich a bit too well...vanilla.Touchwiz provides some bells and whistles and plenty of software right out of the box and you even get an office product \"Polaris Office\" that actually works well and easy to use.. with tutorial guides to boot!  I still educate end users and believe you me, they want simple and stupid until they get the hang of things and then they can fly on their own.  Most don't have the time to tinker either.  Samsung 2 10.1 gives you the best of both worlds without breaking the bank.  And if you don't want a big tab you can always get the Tab 2 7.0.  Works like a charm and extremely convenient especially for reading and surfing on the go.  The thing weighs practically nothing and you're carrying around power in your briefcase, bag or whatever that use to sit on your desk not 10 years ago.  I know this wasn't the most technical review on the set but hey you can get those from well... youtube.  Just be careful, there's alot of egos out there waiting to deceive.  Get the Tab 2 10.1. I'd recommend it in a heart beat.", "Title": "Be real when you review", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "Xin Ning", "ReviewID": "R7FCWNIYSKGP3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

contrast, which is the signature of Samsung products (I own Samsung LCD TV and Galaxy S2 cellphone). It really stood out from other Android tablets on display. However I balked at purchasing it due to its lacking of some of the functionality. So when the galaxy tab 2 came out, with 100 bucks less price tag, and an Android 4 OS, I had a big leap of faith that I pre-ordered it on Amazon and had my friend brought it to me from the U.S.After playing it for a few days, I have to say I am very frustrated and disappointed. Owning a Samsung galaxy tab 2 is merely for the sake of having an android tablet, it doesn't live up to my expectation.Let me start with some positives:1. Latest Android ice cream sandwich OS. Although so far I haven't been able to take any benefit from it.2. Option of expanding the capacity up to 32GB. This is the big difference from iPad. I plugged in a 32GB MicroSD and the tablet instantly had 48GB capacity in total.3. The 400 dollar price tag is a much sweeter deal for a new release, even though hardware wise it didn't change much.However, so far I found the negatives out weigh the positives:1. The color is blueish and washed out, comparing to galaxy tab (remember that grand canyon screen saver!) or galaxy s2, it is a big disappointment for me. It no longer has the distinguish vibrant color that sets Samsung apart from any other Android tablets. And there is no where in the setting that I can tune the color. The only thing I can adjust is the brightness.2. The response of the tap or swipe on the screen is not consistent. Sometimes it's sensitive, sometimes it is not and you really have to tap/swipe hard or multiple times before it responds.3. The response time is slow. Especially when using Youtube, it takes a lot of time to render the video thumbnails.4. There is a very annoying bug in Youtube. As shown in the video I attached. If you search an artist, all result videos come up, however after you play any of it and return to the result screen, none of the thumbnail responds! To add insult to the injury, Youtube is one of the 'systemware' pre-loaded by Samsung, and for some strange reason Youtube app was blocked on this tablet, i.e, you DO NOT see Youtube app in the play store, so you can't even update it.5. Samsung makes its own skin on top of Android OS. Some widgets/apps are ok, for example, the S-Planner replaces the google calendar, but some very basic and useful default apps on galaxy s2 are missing, for example, 'clock'. Now if I want a stop watch or timer I need a separate app, because the pre-loaded 'Alarm' doesn't cut it.6. Try editing an email is pain in the neck. The cursor doesn't appear where you tap, actually it almost doesn't respond at all. I had to download a different keyboard with cursor to move the cursor around.7. The battery doesn't last long. It takes about 5 hours for a full charge, but when streaming video or radio, it goes down very fast, definitely not the 10 hours battery time Samsung claims it has.8. The camera/video quality is bad, as mentioned by some other reviewers. For me I don't intend to use it for taking pictures or videos so it doesn't bother me that much.9. The pre-loaded Polaris Office 4.0 is still probably in its infancy. I had some document from work that I wanted to read at my leisure time on this tablet, half of them wouldn't work, the Polaris office just crashes the moment it finishes loading the file of the following format: .pptx, and .docx. But this may not be problem of Samsung, but rather the limitation of Polaris Office.10.For people who have Harmony remote please keep it. The function of 'smart remote' app is not even close. It probably works well for people who just have one or two devices in one room, and need only basic buttons.People use tablet for different things. Some are very happy with this tablet because the apps/function they use happen to be flawless, but for me, due to the above reasons I can only say that I am disappointed at least.REVIEW UPDATE JULY 10th. The tablet prompt for OS upgrade to 4.0.4 (jelly bean). After the upgrade the images on the tablet becomes sharper and more colorful, or as I say it, more Samsung like.

This is my 4th day with it and I absolutely love it. I've been wanting a tablet for over a year(I love tech toys) and finally couldn't take messing around with one that wasn't mine so I had to buy one. I have a 17\" laptop that only gets 1.5 hrs on a charge and wanted something smaller that I could do easy internet stuff like twitter, facebook, surfing, and listening to internet radio, podcasts, and music that was smaller and more mobile then my ginormous laptop. While shopping around I essentially looked at mid-priced android tablets, mostly because of my angst toward apple thanks to the awfulness of itunes software.The other tablet that really caught my eye was the Asus Transformer TF300. You can do an easy google search to see where the transformer shines where the galaxy doesn't and vice versa. Ultimately storage space wasn't a huge deal for me and I really have no need for an hdmi out. What won me over the transformer is the display of the galaxy and it is night and day difference for me. Since browsing the internet is 90% of what I'll use a tablet for a great display, where samsung truly shines, was worth more to me then a better speced out transformer. For anyone looking to buy a new 10.1\" tablet definitely give the transformer a look. I also would suggest looking at the Motorola Xoom.Pros:- size, probably one of the smaller 10.1\" mid level tablets- display is bright and crisp, text is very easy to read even when I have screen brightness all the way turned down- infrared sensor that can be used to control your home entertainment center (a very nice option if you don't have a cool awesome logitech harmony remote)- battery life has been great also among the top of the midlevel tablets(do a google search)Cons:- long battery charge time, not a big deal as I'm mostly going to recharge at night- no stock hdmi out- the wtf so tiny charging cord, I mean really who wants a short charging cord? Makes no sense to me- no standard usb port, instead they have an applelike proprietary port- feels like for the price there should be some kind of hdmi out and 32 gb of hard drive space instead of 16Because of the last con I can't give this tablet 5 stars, instead it gets 4.", "Title": "My First Tablet", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Author": "Bit Twiddler", "ReviewID": "R2KVOLPOXUJT5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using an iPad 1 and iPad 2, hearing how everyone praises the iPad line, and knowing that iPad is seemingly synonymous with \"tablet computer,\" I was ready to try the Samsung Galaxy Tab and presumed it would be a good, but inferior experience to those other devices.

With the iPad, I have to hunt for things like the back button, whereas on the Samsung, it's always there at the bottom.  Things just seem more intuitive on Android.- It is easier to program. You don't need a $99 developer license and a provisioning file that allows you to deploy to a specific unit. And you don't need to use a low-level, proprietary programming language.- Samsung's browser works according to existing global standards, compared to other companies that change the way the browser works just because they feel like it.  As a result, on the Samsung Galaxy Tab, all web sites just work the way they are supposed to.- It's less expensive.A few days after trying the Samsung Galaxy Tab, I got the opportunity to try the iPad 3.

M Young", "ReviewID": "R39NVV4K70FOJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought long and hard about a tablet, knowing that for me it would basically be a toy. Plus I already had a Nook Color. When the iPad2 reduced in price, I thought about getting one of those, but decided against it for the following reasons: (1) no Flash--and yes, I know HTML5 is going to make that obsolete, but in the meantime many websites have a lot of money invested in Flash animation and even restaurants use the silly format to show you their menus (geez, just give us a LIST already--I don't need pretty pictures to find out if you serve something I can eat) and (2) I'm already invested in the Android market and would have to buy many iPad apps that I already have free from Android.I have not even used it for a week yet, but this a preliminary review with some information I saw requested in other reviews (not necessarily here at Amazon).UPS delivered this a little before 6:30 p.m. I immediately plugged it into the charger and left it alone. It was charged by 10 p.m. (it might have been earlier, but the unit was away from me and I heard no bleep or flash that might have have indicated the charge was finished). So it does not take six or eight or ten hours to charge as I have seen claimed on other sites. By midnight I was attached to wireless, had gotten into all my accounts and Android apps and was happily surfing and rearranging my home screen.I used this over the weekend at a science fiction convention. I did not use it constantly, but turned the screen on and off all day for about a 12-hour period, reading Facebook and blogs, checking the news and weather, looking at the convention schedule online, playing short You Tube videos, etc. Nothing excessive, but sometimes did have it on for a half hour to 45-minutes at the time. I also do not have a lot of widgets going, like the Accu-Weather and news widgets that come pre-loaded on the home screen. (They delete easily.) In that 12-hour period it never got below 78% on the battery. It's very quick and fast and responds to a Targus stylus (rubber tipped) wonderfully, much better than my Nook color. The resolution of the screen is impressive. Maybe it's not the new iPad's \"retinal display,\" but it's very, very sharp and bright, even though I keep my brightness turned down to save power. I downloaded the Nook app and the magazines I subscribe to look gorgeous and are simple to read; if not, a tap of the screen makes the text bigger. The unit also comes with Zinio preloaded, an app I plan to use to subscribe to non-US magazines. Kindle books look nice as well, but to me this is too large for marathon reading sessions. I prefer my Nook Color for that. Like my Android phone and my Nook Color, it connects to wireless like a dream, which is more than I can say for my laptop.Things that might lead you to choose another tablet: (1) The camera is nothing special. It takes good close ups, but further away was problematic. However, I was in a low-light situation each time. Taking photos outside may be totally different. Why Samsung chose to remove the flash I have no idea. Silly, really. But who buys a tablet to take pictures with? (2) With a stylus I can tap to enlarge an image (like Google Maps), but not make it smaller and there is no plus or minus sign on the screen as on my Android phone. (3) Blogger doesn't work in the browser; you have to download the Blogger app, but that works well. iExit doesn't work on it, either. Rats. (4) As at least one other person mentioned, the screen cap button is right in a place where you can hit it easily. I thought of a good use for it this weekend (took a screen cap of the online schedule for the convention I was at, made a short-cut of it to the screen, then pulled up the screen cap for reference rather than going to the web page all the time). Very convenient! (5) Hate the pre-loaded websites in the browser, but I have seen this on other tablets. Apparently we the public are stupid (or lazy) and can't find our own favorite websites and bookmark them. [eyes roll], and (6) my Bluetooth keyboard won't work with it right now because there is as yet no driver for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).I hope to check back with further comments.[A few weeks later after I bought this, my husband found an Asus Transformer (TF300) at a good price. It appears to be just as good as this Samsung and the camera is better. It has a zoom and does take a better photo. So if you were looking for a tablet with a better camera the Asus Transformer may be for you. Note: It doesn't have a flash either.][Update July 31, 2012 to answer \"How long does the battery last\"?: I was sick and tired of not seeing any Olympic equestrian coverage except for a couple of hours in the wee hours of the morning, so downloaded the \"Live Extra\" Olympics app from the Android Market. This carries live streaming of events as well as archived events. This morning I watched about two hours of live streaming of the jumping finals. When that ended I watched six hours of cross-country eventing replay. Then about an hour and forty minutes of the replay of the jumping. I had my brightness at about 35%. This got me down to 10% of the battery from a full charge.

Bar none!I also own the 7 inch Samsung wifi-only tablet, and this is a bigger, faster, better version of that (by a long shot) in the 10.1 inch size. I love Samsung's tablets. Perfect form factor and shape. And they are absolutely gorgeous.This 10.1 Tab 2 is amazing! It's very fast and snappy. Takes gorgeous pictures, the screen resolution and pixel density is amazing. The screen brightness (when turned all the way up) is brighter than anything I have ever seen on any device! It's blindingly bright! All my apps run perfectly well. It has stereo speakers that are nice and loud. It has Android 4.0 ice cream sandwich and a Samsung overlay over it. It's not overly bloated though. Seems very minimal with the Samsung specific software.The Peel app that allows you to control your TV, Direct TV, and  audio receiver is a huge bonus. You can control any device. It's an amazing app and even let's you search for and schedule recordings, learns shows you like and will present them to you. Very well made IR remote control app for your home theater or television set. It can control everything.Netflix, Amazon, or Samsung Hub movies play in 720p HD and look amazing on this screen. The sound is amazing as well with the stereo speakers. The screen is actually 1280x800, and can do better than just 720 lines of horizontal resolution.The Chrome browser syncs with your desktop, phone, and other device browsers so that all your bookmarks, favorites, cookies, passwords, and recently viewed all show up on every device.Social media apps are optimized for the larger screen in a pretty amazing fashion. Twitter, Facebook, Google+ are all excellent and function very well.Your Google account backups everything, so you never lose a thing. Never lose another video, picture, application setting, or anything if your phone falls into a river. It's all backed up and can be restored.It even has a GPS radio so you can benefit from navigation, maps, places, geo location, and all sorts of services and apps that require location information.Reading books with the Kindle app is flawless. It keeps track of where you are on each page, makes life easier. Whether I am reading on my phone, or my Tab, or my desktop computer, you never lose your place, notes, markup, bookmarks. Pretty awesome.The battery life is amazing. Still haven't been able to run it out. It's been almost 2 days of usage. Not heavy usage, but surfing the net, downloading all my apps and setting them up, rearrange the homescreens, and playing some movies and songs.Samsung is the world leader in smartphone sales and this really shows why. They aren't overpriced products. They are well made and perform better than any other product out there.

Browne", "ReviewID": "R35PVT5LPUOU1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the Samsung Galaxy 2 Tab last weekend, but in the few days I've had it, I can say it's a wonderful device. About a year ago I was looking at netbooks to save weight and space when I travel. Then as tablets made more inroads to the market, I decided this would be the way to go. I'm very hapy with my purchase. The Galaxy is super quick to shift between pages, website, apps, etc. It loads pages quicker than any laptop, desktop, or phone I've worked with. I have an Android phone and through your gmail account, all your preferences and apps will synch up on your tablet too. If you want entertainment on a plane or in your hotel room, you can use netflix or the Samsung media hub to download shows and movies very easily. I like the OS, and the ICS seems to be great. Plus, you don't have to worry about what the folks at Apple like and dislike about IT technology. The 10.1\" screen also seems to have a better aspect ratio than the Ipad, which means websites look good in native resolution. You don't need to view things in their \"app\" form unless you want to. Battery life seems very healthy, I can run about a day and a half of fairly intense use between charges. Which leads to my biggest complaint: the power cord for the charger is only about 36\" long, so you have to find a really close outlet. Overall, I'm very happy with this, and will get a lot of use from this.

I wanted to wait a while before writing this review to be sure I had tested it out thoroughly. I must say that I am extremely pleased with the performance of this tablet. I researched for months before I bought a tablet because I wanted one that wasn't restricted, had good reviews, but most of all, was affordable. I didn't want to drop $500+ into a tablet or an i-pad. I got this tablet and a leather case with a removable/rechargeable/bluetooth keyboard for under $350. That was one heck of a deal to me. Another good thing about this tablet is that it comes the the android 4.1.1 operating system. From what I read, the previous OS was somewhat restricted. I got this tablet from Amazon, so I wouldn't worry about getting an older version.(Update 5-25-13)Loved this tablet so much that my girlfriend couldn't resist getting her own. She too is very satisfied with the tablet. In fact, she likes this tablet over her I-pad Mini that she got from her job.(Update 8-26-13)Now my girlfriends mother got this tablet. Again, all three of us love it! I am now in my second semester using it. Still very satisfied. In fact, Samsung has updated the way the tablet works with external keyboards so now it is even more easy to use. It is much more like a laptop with control v,c,x etc. working better. Before,the tab button would set your cursor off the page instead of the next box down the list (if you were filling out a form like address info etc). Now it all works! One disappointment I still have is that the copy and paste problem still has not been addressed. It's too bad, that is really the only real complaint I have with this tablet.(Update 10-2-13)There was a new software update for this tablet that in my opinion, is an improvement from the previous layout. I have had a few weeks to use it and have enjoyed the update. The best part about this update is that the COPY AND PASTE WORKS!!! Finally, the only huge complaint I had with this tablet has been addressed! My tablet hasn't crashed using copy and paste since the recent software update!  Battery Life/Portability  Every single day that I go to school I put this tablet through its paces. I take hours of notes, study/read books on it, watch videos, listen to music, I use everything daily on it. It's so nice to have the portability of a tablet. Especially in a crowded area with little space like a train. Unlike a computer, I can pull the tablet out and turn it on and off without waiting for it to boot up or shut down. It's also very nice to not have to deal with a permanent keyboard for situations like that. Battery life is amazing too. I start using it on the train at 7 am, go through the entire day at college, and continue to use it until I am back from my train ride which is around 4:30 pm. That's 9 and a half hours of near constant use with the wifi on and it still has around 25% battery life left.  Note Taking  It's very convenient for note taking because unlike an i-pad, Microsoft word, power point, and excel work on it for FREE! It comes with software that will run all of this, however, I prefer kingsoft office which was also free. It's just more user friendly. During note taking, I often get on Google and insert pictures into my notes. I must admit that it isn't quite as easy to do as a computer because you can't simultaneously have a word program up at the same time as the internet browser. But it does save your spot in the word program and in the internet browser so it's very easy to jump back and fourth. I have typed many papers and taken many notes for hours at a time and felt comfortable doing so. This is why I got the 10.1\" vs the 7\". I wanted to be comfortable because I knew I would be using this for long periods of time. I even typed this review on my tablet. However, keep in mind that I don't use the touchscreen keyboard for my typing. I got a leather case with a removable keyboard. GSAstore (tm) - 10.1 Inch Protfolio Case with Removable Bluetooth \u00ae Keyboard for Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 (N8000/N8010/N8013). Black I am very happy with this product and recommend checking it out. The touchscreen keyboard isn't bad, just not efficient enough for long periods of typing in my opinion. There is one thing I discovered that can be annoying. When copying and pasting, it can cause the tablet to reboot. This doesn't happen every time you copy and paste, but either way, it's a pain. I did research online and apparently this has nothing to do with the tablet but with all newer Android operating systems. Phones and tablets are included. I am sure Android will fix this with an update in the future. This is one of the only problems I have found with this tablet.Update 5-9-13 (Note Taking)I recently found out that this tablet can have trouble with documents that are big. I mean VERY big. I have an anatomy notes document that is literally 160+ pages with loads of pictures that I inserted into it. The tablet takes a while to load it to begin with, but the larger problem resides with scrolling through the document. It's large enough to where the scrolling is no longer smooth but \"jittery\". Also, changes take a while to save. This is a HUGE document though. It's probably unlikely that most people will run into this issue with normal sized documents!ReadingI know that some people as well as myself were concerned about this being strenuous on the eyes after long duration's of reading. I have not found this to be the case. The screen can be easily dimmed down while reading your book. You can pick what background color you want behind the text to help (kindle store). Another cool feature (amazon kindle store) is that while reading a book, if you see a word you don't know, you can select that word and the program provides you with a definition of that word.  Web Browsing  Browsing the web is crisp and smooth, so is watching videos via websites like Youtube or forums that don't have apps. The streaming for the apps works wonderfully too (most of my experience is with Netflix and IGN). The screen is amazing and clear, especially when watching a movie or show in HD.MemoryThe 16 GB of stock memory actually lasts a pretty long time. I have put all of my music (about 8 GB) on it, and have a whole lot of documents and apps installed with plenty of room to spare. You can always buy the micro SD card to extend the memory another 32 GB. You can connect this tablet to your computer via the cable provided and get anything you want from your computer. I simply drag/dropped my music into my tablet. Its very simple. Most of my music is in i-tunes, this tablet automatically converts the i-tunes files so they can be used.  Email  It is very easy to sync multiple emails to this tablet and also very easy to navigate those emails. You can attach any file just as if you were on your computer.Sound/SpeakersThe speakers on this tablet are in fact surprisingly loud. I would say they are about as loud as most laptop speakers. Obviously they don't make the music sound \"full\" with bass and other variations in tone but that isn't really a problem for me. I am impressed with the speakers sound quality.Video ChatMy girlfriend and I use our tablets to video chat. It works very well, the picture quality isn't HD, but neither is my $1700 laptop. They look about the same to tell the truth. The system is very easy to use and is much more convenient through a tablet versus a computer!Update 6-18-13 (Screen)I have had this tablet for quite some time now and have no problems to report. I still use it every day even when I am not in school. It is just so convenient to have around the house for various reasons. I wanted to talk some about how well the glass for the screen has held up. I didn't buy a clear screen cover because I read that Samsung used \"their own version of gorilla glass\". I have had it in a case the entire time that I have owned the tablet. I have yet to see any permanent marks/scratches of any kind. I simply use glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth every now and then to clean the screen. So with that being said, I would say that if you have a decent case, you don't need to waste money on a clear screen protector.  I will continue to update this review as I learn more about the tablet or if I run into anything problematic. So far, this has exceeded my expectations. It works so well and is very convenient on various levels. If anyone has any questions about this tablet, I would be more than happy to answer to the best of my knowledge.", "Title": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is a great tablet!", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Vince J.

I currently use an Android phone and like that so this was a natural choice for operating system but it's more than that.There many good reviews here so I'll just touch on some highs and lows.The Android OS4 (ICS) is really nice.

What Samsung gives you it what you get so that means more naving around to some often used apps.>Samsung \"Kies\" is a good idea but like other Samsung pc software I've experienced, it big, quirky, slow, and there are much better choices out there.>At the 400 threshold, other tabs have more connectors, something for Samsung to work on.>I turn on my Toshiba computer, registers itself, I turn on my old ipad, registers itself, I turn on my samsung galaxy tab2 and no such luck. The registrations process was a hassle: 30 minutes later I think I registered it. 2 days later I get an email from samsung to complete my registration, but the instructions in the email are incorrect, 10 minutes after poking around I find it, oh, it wants a number that my galaxy tab DOESN'T have! 40 minutes of online chatting and the rep says I'm all set. Jeeeeez and come to think of it, he never asked for a purchase date. OmG, I had to provide the serial number off the back of the tablet (not the box # according to the website).>>>Well someone should tell Samsung that .005 size type printed in light gray on a medium gray back is just a great way to ensure customer satisfaction, oh, and BTW... it's the same number that's on the box!!!>The smart remote, like Kies, good idea gone bad. It works but the channel guide is just a jumble of TV shows leaving me wondering what's on. It needs a complete, editable channel lineup, not just a screen of programs to choose from (who knows if all the programs are there?) Because it does not have a \"remote control\" type interface, the app presumes the on/off and input state of your components. Just too confusing, this would really be great if it had a simple remote control interface.Initially I was happy with the performance but within a month it seemed to be getting glitchy, locking up every so often and selecting text was nearly impossible, as was horizontal scrolling in a video playback. For $399 I expect better basic performance. The poor performance of the wizbang remote and kies file transfer simply add to other shortcomings.

I played w the Kindle and got familiar w it but I just couldn't get the tab off my mind... So I did a ton of research and ultimately decided to take the kindle back and trade it for the Tab.Boy am I glad I did! What an amazing difference in functionality! I absolutely adore the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. There were a lot of things missing from the Kindle but the Tab isn't lacking anything other than a usb port, however, you can buy little adapters for this. Please note, the charge cord it comes w is teenie so a longer one might be a good side purchase as well.The sound has nice volume for a small device and is crisp. It has beautiful graphics, very clear and vibrant. The accuracy of the touch screen is fantastic, haven't felt like it mistypes or has lagged on me at all. The size is perfect, not too big not too small, easy to cart around. It feels well made like a quality piece, it has enough weight so as not to feel cheap but it's not heavy at all. Having two cameras was cool to me but not necessary, the quality of them is good, not great and there is no flash but it does also do video. Battery life has been excellent so far, I'm on it on and off all day and just charge at night while I'm sleeping.One thing that caused me to trade in the Kindle was the lack of apps. The Tab doesn't have that problem. There really isn't much that it can't do. It comes w some pretty cool apps built in, like the remote app where you can control your tv and view programs. Bonus, it makes a great reader too so you can download the Kindle app and have it all!Overall, I'd say they did pretty darned well w this little gem, I highly recommend it to anyone.", "Title": "Ecstatic!!", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Vincent P. \"Kindle Fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R1CRLEC5INOXG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Android tablet.

The one problem is, in spite of what the specs say, the tablet does not play flash video.  Samsung support says it's  because Adobe has discontinued support for Flash on Android 4.o.x and they are working on a solution.  If you try to download Flash Player 11.1 from Google Play it says it's not compatible with the Galaxy (GT-P5113) with it's 4.0.1 Android. Other than that it's a great purchase.

Pages with many ads load super fast and have no lag whatsoever. I don't like the layout of the stock internet app so that is why i use chrome instead.Movies: I use Netflix for most of the movies i watch and they look really nice on the screen. They stream really fast even if you don't have the best WiFi connection. YouTube movies also look very good. Load really fast and depending of the movie they look really good too. (if a video wasn't taken with a decent camera of course its not gonna look the best).Games: Some of the games i play include cut the rope, angry birds, drag racing, flow, and many many more. All the games load really quick and i notice no lag with any of them. When i first bought it i was worried that the games would lag a little bit but they don't at all.So many of you reading this will wonder how does this compare to an iPad. When Samsung first made this they didn't intend for it to be a comparable device to the iPad, the Samsung note is more of a comparison. But my dad did have an iPad 2 before and i used it before i got this tablet. And i believe that was about 500 (the iPad). I got my tablet new at best buy for 400. Even though it wasn't made to be compared to the iPad, the Samsung is far better than it. IOS (operating system of apple products)is horrible. They have had the same layout of the main pages for years and there is not customizing ability. You cant get widgets(best things ever) and it looks like something from many many years ago. Many of the apps crash for no reason on IOS too. My tablets home screen has a lot of things to customize. U can have apps and widgets. If u have a g mail account u can display your inbox on the home screen which is very nice. you can make a weather widget so you can see the weather 24/7.Productivity: I am a student so i got a keyboard that plugs into the bottom and basically turns the tablet into a notebook. The keyboard was 50 dollars and was for sure worth it. It works great and to type papers i use Polaris office. Its basically Microsoft word, power point, and excel for the tablet. And all of Microsoft documents are compatible with Polaris office so if i download a word doc. i can view and edit it in Polaris office. Also if i just make something like a book report i can save it as a word doc. so my teacher can view it on his/her computer.Actually one complaint but it isn't with the tablet its with Polaris office, it doesn't have spell check. Lol.Another cool thing that this device can do is control your TV. Trust me its awesome and it really impressed my parents. Also its funny to see their reaction when I change the channel and then dont realize that i can do it from my tablet and they think they just sat on the remote. The tablet comes with an app called peel. When u go into it asks you what brand of TV you are trying to control and if you have a cable box and stereo and that such. I can bring up the guide and see what is on and scroll through the channels. Also i can choose if i want the sound to come through the TV or i can have it come through the stereo and i can control that too. This took me about 5 minutes and i had no problems whatsoever with it.Overall: This is a wonderful tablet and even though 400 sounds like a lot, it is 100 percent worth it. Especially if u have a android phone, cause everything u do on your phone you can do on your tablet. It is really fast as long as u dont keep 900 apps running at the at the same time but if u keep 10 or less you will be fine. The battery lasted me about 10 hour and i was chenking my email playing games and using wifi so i guess maybe it could last a little longer. Its great for a student like me or anyone i guess.

That being said, I was not interested buying Apple products, so that was the first selling point for me.The price one may argue is comparable to the Ipad, however as I was intending to purchase a Dropbox account ($99.00 per year), the Samsung, which comes bundled with 1 free year, proved to be a good option. In my opinion this puts the price of the device down to $300.00 which was acceptable to me.The device itself is lightweight and handles well. After a few moments of setting up the different accounts, I was ready to begin using my new device.The stuff I liked:It comes with a Kindle app, which syncs to my Amazon account and pulls all my purchased books for me, this is great for me if it means I do not have to carry around laptop & Kindle, the tradeoff is that I lose the accessability my 3G Kindle gave me when I finished a book without another to read. Also in comparison to the Kindle, it renders PDFs far better and easier to read which was perhaps my only issue with my Kindle.The 50gig Dropbox account means I do not have to download reading material as it would load directly from the account.Using the Kindle app, I can read PDFs and it will remember my location the next time I open the document; It didn't seem to do this with the Polaris App.Skype Works! Well the audio is good and the front facing camera is clear enough for my liking, although, due to its positioning, you have to hold it at the right angle to centre your image, else you're sending pictures of your nostrils. The rear camera shows only the bottom half of the image, I assume this is due to the incorrect hardware being identified. Again this is tolerable to me...It multi-tasked very well, i.e. I was able to video chat while playing Angry birds, without any sticking, delays, etc.The built in print function claims to only work with Samsung printers (which I presume are over priced), however, I downloaded cloud print (Google app) and was able to access and print to any of the printers within my network.I am not a photographer but I liked the rear facing camera & its functions. Particularly the Panoramic function (which I've never gotten to work on a regular digital camera) and the Smile photo (focuses on faces and waits for a smile). Both of these functions amused me greatly. The lack of a flash can be an issue, but in my opinion that's what you'd buy a proper camera for.The remote function works but as far as I can tell the range is limited. As I reside outside of the US, the added functions for the TVs are not available to me. That being said, if I wanted to annoy someone watching TV nearby, I found a new way...Stuff I didn't really like:To start with my last point, the remote seems to only work with a wifi connection, this is a +/- in my opinion. I understand that the App will fetch the codes over the net, however once you've locked the codes in for your devices, one would assume it would still function without wifi access, however it doesn't seem to.The lack of flash / artificial lighting means you have to video chat in bright areas.The device comes without much of a manual, this is fine to a point as it's a fun learning experience, but at some point i will want to know shortcuts etc to unlock the true power of my toy, I hope there is one available online.My Biggest peeve is with the charger, in two parts:1) The enclosed cord is about 2.5-3' long. This is ridiculously short especially in a workstation environment where the power comes from behind a desk / space saver. The cord is a Samsung connector to USB which plugs into the wall adapter, so I will find a USB extender and see if that will alleviate this problem.2) The device is lightweight, and the connector snaps in snuggly. This is good if you have issues with flimsy connectors, however, my constant fear is that I or someone else trips into or bounces into a cord. Given the weight of the device, if the cord is pulled, the device is coming down with it. I'd have hoped for some sort of magnetic connector to prevent this happening.All in all, I like my toy and gave it 4 out of 5 Stars, I'd really have loved to give it 4.5 but since I couldn't I rounded down.

IMHO it has some advantages and disadvantages over IPad.  The IPad annoyingly requires ITunes for moving most pictures, video and music where Android doesn't- but Android doesn't seem quite as intuitive as IPad.  Frankly I think both units have a ways to go before I'd consider using either in place of a decent laptop running Windows 7 or Mac OS.  I often wonder if the limitations inherent in tablet computers are pre-designed in order to try and prevent cannibalism of their regular computers.

The Samsung display is also larger (10.1\" vs. 9.7\"). Both have Bluetooth, but the Samsung runs a newer version (3 vs. 2.1).Unlike the iPad, the Samsung is Flash friendly. Installing Flash from Google Play is easiest on all but the most recently produced Tab 2s. If you have the most recent one, like I do, installing Flash for Android 4.0 from the Adobe Flash archive site was just a little bit more work.Battery life is another advantage of the Tab 2 over the iPad 2. The Tab 2 has a 7000 mAh battery rated at 14 hours. The iPad 2 is rated at 10 hours (Apple tends not to share detailed specifications).The iPad 2 and Tab 2 have comparable forward and back facing cameras. At a little over 3mp on the rear camera, neither is particularly special. The iPad 3 and Galaxy Note include a 5mp rear camera that does a better job. Still, neither the 3mp nor the 5mp camera is going to give you results comparable to even a sub $50 digial camera with a much higher resolution chip and larger optics.When you compare the Tab 2 with the comparably priced iPad Mini, the iPad does even more poorly. For a tablet that gives the Tab 2 a run for its money, you might want to take a look at the new $400 Nexus 10. The Samsung produced Nexus 10 display is the highest resolution on the market at a fraction of the price of iPad 3s and 4s.", "Title": "More Tablet for Less Money (Tab 2 vs. iPad 2)", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Gary Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2705V4H46XNQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned tablets for a long time, beginning with my NCR 3125 and including my Kindle Fire, but as a personal computer my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is the best so far.  With a screen the size of a fine notebook -- noticeably larger than the iPad's -- and access to the full library of Android apps, the Galaxy perfectly fills that gap between smartphone toy and laptop tool.  The ability to link a Bluetooth keyboard, one of the Fire's only serious shortcomings, makes the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 serious technology for serious work.But entertainment isn't forgotten.  Coupled with my www.amazon.com/prime account I've watched dozens of movies, TV shows and other videos (most for free) and listened to hundreds of songs, again often at no charge.  With the Kindle App (included on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) I have full access to my complete Kindle library; though I prefer my Fire for most reading simply because it's easier to tuck in a pocket, reading on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is an enjoyable experience, especially for someone whose eyes, like mine, have given many years of good service.For research, data collection and similar functions the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is simply unparalleled; the two built-in cameras are perfectly usable for record-keeping or casual photos.  The built-in GPS is stunningly accurate, and the internal position sensor lends details hard to obtain from other sources, such as position and bearing of distant (even aerial) objects and navigation info.  I have had a great deal of fun with the astronomy app, which shows a detailed sky map as though it were a window into any direction I hold it, including through the Earth; amazing!I really can't recommend this enough.  If you've been considering a Tablet, go right to the best and get a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.

I've had it for about 8 months and I can't really say there's anything that bothers me. I paid full price and I believe it was worth it. So far battery life is just as good as it was when the tablet was new and I believe even when watching videos ans playing music, the battery holds up pretty well. Aside from the obvious, which would be sending email, browsing the web and streaming music and video, which this tablet does well, there are a few features that I love. First, I love being able to search my files just like I would in a computer by using folders. The integration between the Xbox and the tablet is awesome, being able to use my tv screen by having my Xbox on and controlling music, video and picture slides from the tablet is amazing and it makes everything so easy. Being able to access files from my Samsung galaxy s3 and send files directly to the phone works great as well. There's 2 Samsung tablets and 2 Samsung phones in the house and all the products work great together. Other than that I think the touchscreen and keyboard are both fast and responsive, the system crashes rarely and the tablet seems to handle all apps without any lag or any major issues.

Fedex showed up as expected and everything was intact, nothing missing. This was a concern for me, since this was a refurbished tablet.The unit was charged to approximately 70% of capacity when it came out of the box, so achieving a full charge didn't take very long. Upon initial power-up, it acquired my wifi immediately and was net ready in less than two minutes. It ran through available software updates and all downloads/installations were logged in the status screen on the lower right corner of the tool bar....very convenient. Since I have a Samsung phone, PC and flatscreen, the Tab 2 quickly synched with everything, including my GMail and cloud files. To be sure I had Jelly Bean as my OS, I went to Settings, Device and manually obtained 4.1.1. I also selected the power-saver mode in the settings menu. Once I'd rebooted, JB was in place and running. The next few hours were spent downloading familiar software and setting up my home page. The screen is very responsive, and my daughter (a dyed-in-the-wool iPad promoter,)was a little envious of the vivid images I was showing her, as well as the versatility of the Tab 2. (It's nice when the old man is right once in awhile!) In all, I was on-line for more than 9 hours, and my Tab was showing that it still had 40% of it's battery left. It took another two hours to get down to 22%, at which point I finally plugged it in. By the next day, I was using it to control my flat-screen HD TV, and play movies from NetflixOverall experience so far is excellent. Would recommend the Tab 2 to anyone.UPDATE SINCE INITIAL REVIEW: If you use a lot of apps that employ Java, they will not be supported on this tablet. After many attempts to initiate Java-based apps, I finally gave up and contacted Samsung Tech Support. They informed me that Oracle (Java's owners) and Samsung are in litigation, and Oracle has ceased support of the Samsung OS, so Java is unobtainable. Otherwise, everything else is running great.

Once I turned that off, performance was much better.*  fast start up and switching between landscape and portrait quickly.*  so far, battery life is very good, but that is something you have to wait and see how it goes.*  not part of the device, but was able to get a 2 year warranty and accident protection from Square Trade for $42.  Since it covers accidents with no deductible, I thought it was worth it.  I bought this separate with a 30% coupon and not through Amazon.  If you are buying a refurb, be sure to buy the warranty on the same day you buy the device even though you don't have it in your hands yet.*  Amazon Kindle store and Music work great.*  Email program, calendar & contacts programs work great with my work email (MS Outlook exchange server).  Did not have to but a separate program like I did with my Kindle Fire.Cons;*  was not able to watch Amazon videos until I found a compatible Adobe Flash APK.  It took 2 tries, but did find a version that worked and now I can watch my Amazon videos from the browser.  If you are a big user of Amazon video, you need to know this before buying this product with Android 4.0.4.*  went through 2 upgrades after connecting to WiFi.  The upgrades went well, but probably would not need with a new tablet versus the refurb I had.*  more than 1 app that runs on my Samsung Galaxy S2 phone is not available for this device.

I really like the tablet. I stream Netflix, read books, you name it. The downsides include a bone-headed location for the proprietary charge/dock/USB port. It's on the \"bottom\" beneath the Samsung logo. If you're using the tablet in landscape mode, you can't charge it if it's in a case - unless you pay for the dock. Then it's not very portable. The iPad has the port on the side. Makes a lot more sense.Big plus - it uses Corning \"Gorilla Glass\" - looks and feels like plastic, but it's not.  But, it's obvious that Samsung cut corners where they could. Cheesy plastic cap over the memory card and the frame around the screen is painted.One thing to watch out for, and I reluctantly ;-) give the iPad caveats here - when you close the case lid on an iPad, the iPad sleeps. Not with with the Tab 2. Plus, when you plug in the charger, the screen turns on.  So if you close the case and plug in the charger, the screen turns on - but you can't see it.  I did not figure this out until I charged it a couple of times overnight, only to have the charge max at 90%. I assumed the screen turned on when I removed the charger, as it was on when I opened the case. Nope.  So you either have to shut off the tab (not put to sleep) before charging, or plug in the charger, then put it to sleep.6 month update: Still like the tablet, but there is one major annoyance - Samsung's required website check-in.  The tablet checks Samsung for software updates. I don't use the software and uninstalled what I could - there are much better third party apps out there. Every few weeks Samsung resets your security information - so your password and user name have to be re-entered.  I was in the middle of taking notes when this \"security\" message popped up. I chose \"cancel\" - it came up again 15 seconds later. Cancel. Came up again. Cancel. Then every 10 seconds. It would not stop. The tablet was useless until I logged into the site.  I was not home and did not have access to the email account associated with the tablet - and since I had no idea what password I used, I needed the reset link sent to me.  So I had to put up with the message every 10 seconds.  Had this been a $75 tablet it would have been an expensive Frisbee.

They were my main source for making my decision.I was between getting an Ipad 2, the kindle fire HD 8.9 and the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. I ruled out the ipad mainly because it was so expensive. Its screen resolution is poorer than the tab 2 and it doesn't have a micro sd slot.The kindle fire is definately a competitor pricewise but I've seen the operating system and it just seems so limited to amazon content, plus no widgets. The sound quality is like no other but that's what I have a home theater for. On the go I usually plug in headphones so no gain there.As soon as I saw the tab 2 10.1 priced down a hundred bucks I knew it was the one. I must say it was an excellent purchase!! Completely met my expectations.Even though the galaxy tab 2 10.1 is a weeee bit sluggish, its barely noticeable. I imagine that for intense gamers this may bother you after a while.Pros:- great screen size- new operating system is very clean and extremely versatile (like most androids)- front speakers give off great sound- memory slot can give you up to 32gb more. A total of 48gb for an extra 20 bucks instead of other tablets that would charge you well over 100.- great battery life. Normal use connecting and disconnecting wifi, downloading, reading and typing gives about 8-10 hours.- at 300 bucks. Great price.- 50 gb of dropbox space for a year.... FREE- at least mine came with an extension cable. The usb adapter is way to short but with this i don't have any troubles.Cons:- processor is a bit slow but for everyday use, movies and small games its more than enough. Make sure you free up tasks and memory.- keyboard is difficult to type with. I'm always tapping the shortcut button thats just below the spacebar. can't get beyond typing with two fingers either. Considering getting a bluetooth keyboard.- I'd avoid using the camera except for videochatting. Leave taking quality pictures to digital cameras.-touchscreen precision could be much better. Maybe its because of my butcher hands but I tried using a stylus pen and it was a bit off and wouldn't follow through when writing. I wanted to be able to take notes with a pen but it would be extremely frustrating. I read somewhere that the touchscreen precision is set by samsung but you can tweet it using the touchscreen tune app.All in all I must say this is an excellent purchase. If you're looking for a tablet for everyday use and doing some light work with office docs I highly suggest this tablet. I also recommend you get a case with it while you're at it.If I may suggest a few apps:- google chrome. Fast web browsing plus compatible with the PC version- google currents. Get news from different sources. Cool interface- Repli Go Reader. View, edit and add objects to PDF files. I use this for work all the time. Well worth the price.- flash player. Yes, you can use flash on this. The only thing is that it doesn't work on chrome but it does work on the default explorer. Just google adobe flash archives and download the APK 4.0 version.

I wanted something with 32 gig, so the Apple would have cost $599 for WIFI, and $729 for 4G.  Way too much money to surf the web and check email.  Finally, I hated the cult mentality of the whole Apple scene.I liked the Asus TF700, but was completely put off by the build quality issues, and the glass gluing problem discussions that were hitting the forums.  Why pay $499 for something that was poorly built?Saw a Galaxy at Sams, and was impressed with the build quality.  Rugged, nicely put together, and seemed fast enough.  Although it was only 16 gig, I could add a cheap SD card to bring it to 48 gigs.  Plus, the price was only $399.

The Galaxy doesn't even come close.  I've used a number of customer's Ipads, and they work amazingly well.  When you touch the screen, the right link comes up. On the Galaxy, you have to click multiple times to get it to respond, or you have to enlarge the screen to be able to touch the right one.  It's slow, and if something is downloading (like email or an update), the ability to touch the screen stops until the CPU catches up.  Worse, it seems that every week or so, the software plugs up, and everything slows to molasses speed.

Never wipe your screen without some type of lubrication, if your just using a soft cloth out of your towel collection.

This is Samsung's replacement for their earlier 10.1 inch tablet which, if you got the 32GB version, cost a lot more. The reason that this is a step-down from the earlier model is because the Samsung Galaxy Note coming out in June will be their premier tablet. However the Note will cost a little over twice what this one costs.If this is your first tablet you will be very happy. It is easy to use, especially for anyone who has been working with an Android smartphone; if you've had a Samsung phone you will find most things work the same as your phone. For any of these products (smartphone / tablet) the best thing to do is pick a platform and stick with it. Having a mix of Apple, Microsoft, etc., will only cost you a lot of money. Once you have purchased apps, music, etc. from one you should stick with that company for your other hardware appliances. It just makes life a lot easier.One big con I have about this tablet is that it is sometimes slow to respond to my selecting a button or key. I've found that you sometimes have to press a button three or more times before it reacts. Music and video playback have been good so far, although I have gotten the occasional skip or pause -- nothing major though.I like the Polaris Office app that comes included as it works with Microsoft Office file formats and makes it easy for me to work on projects while traveling. Another app that is really cool is the Peel Smart Remote. At home I can control my TV and satellite receiver while viewing the on-tablet TV show guide; however, I've found that at a hotel it may control the TV but will default to wanting to connect to a satellite or cable control box, so it doesn't really work at a hotel like I had hoped it would.If you were planning on using this as a digital camera I would advise you to get a real camera. The rear-facing camera is OK, but the one in my phone is MUCH better. The forward-facing camera is great for a video chat; again, handy if you are traveling. The Skype app works great on this tablet.Get a good class 10 micro SD card for storing music, video and data files. There are some inexpensive class 4 micro SD cards out there, but you will not be happy with how they respond.I'm giving this tablet a 4 instead of 5 because of the response issues. A dual-core processor should be able to handle things better. Seems like Samsung is pushing it too hard because of the 10.1 inch screen. In a smaller size tablet (7 inch) it would probably be fine, but Samsung should have put a better processor in this unit.Overall I would rate this a very good starter tablet; good for what you pay for it.", "Title": "Good entry-level tablet", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "3 Cedars Farm", "ReviewID": "R1LC59TB4UT6JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh my.

The only thing I didn't know is that the newest versions of Flash isn't compatible with the newer Android OS's. I see that some people are giving this tablet bad reviews because of this, but this problem is very easily solved by downloading an older, archived version of Flash from the Adobe website.

It is a lot cheaper. I got it for $449 elsewhere.I have been an Apple user for 15 years. I have been hearing so many great things from Android users so I decided to try this device. Here are the things I liked, didn't like, and what I ended up staying with.The expandable hard drive space is a great feature. There are are microSD cards that are 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. I played movies from a 32 GB card and the movies played really well. The video wasn't slow. This to me is the best part about the device because when you buy an iPad you have to choose what you want upfront. Also when you buy a Samsung you get 50GB of cloud storage with Dropbox so you won't really need a card if you didn't want one, but you will of course need wifi or cell service to access the storage.This has a quad core process which means you can multitask and the tablet never slows down. You have the option to have a dual screen or cascade screen where you can have multiple apps opened at once. Just so you know this does not apply to all apps. The interface is really designed. There is a nice selection of apps. Not as many as Apple, but good. It sucked to find out that if you buy an app from Google Play you have only 15 min. to return it and get a refund. So for me the Apple app store is much better and feels more solid than Google and Samsung.The pen is why I chose to try an Android device. Many of them come with a stylus that has a tip that is more like an actual pen. I wanted to sketch on the device and send the drawings to my Adobe Cloud. Drawing with the pen was not a nice experience and I couldn't find the Adobe apps on this device that I used on my iPad. That was disappointing. You have the option to write while the device typed the words out. This seemed like a great feature, but it was annoying. I still had to type some things because it would put spaces between letters and punctuation marks.The screen resolution is clear. I didn't feel like it had a lot of glare to it so that was also nice. I had to put a screen on my iPad to tone down the glare. A plus for the Samsung. When reading a book in portrait view I felt like Moses holding the 10 commandments. This tablet is longer than it looks. Reading in general on this device wasn't great. Holding it in landscape view was better for working and watching movies. Landscape view is the best option for this tablet. The tablet weights slightly less than the larger iPads. It felt really light and I never got fatigued holding it.Coming from Apple it was harder to navigate, but it's not bad once you get the hang of it. Doing simple task takes a few more extra steps than on the iPad. I will say that the PC world has done an excellent job with offering alternatives to Apple products. Either way you choose, Apple or something else you're going to get a great product. The prices are the same. When you look at cheaper alternatives remember they are cheap for a reason. There are missing features. This Samsung Galaxy Tab is the same price you can get the iPad for and the Samsung performs as well as the iPad and has a few extra features anyone will love.In the end I did end up choosing to keep my iPad over this device. I returned the Samsung after 15 hours using it. I honestly got bored with it. I found that the advantages that most people like about the Samsung I found to be just okay. The pen wasn't very good. The external card wasn't useful either because I use Dropbox and Google Drive. My 32GB iPad mini turns out to be more than enough space for me. Like I said, the iPad and the Samsung in terms of functions and features are the same. It all depends on what your preference is and if your preference is anything that isn't an Apple product, then this is a very good tablet for the money.", "Title": "An Apple user decides to try something else and was pleasantly surprised", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Roger Greenberg \"rgreenbe\"", "ReviewID": "R3NCEQZ7Z7AXZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a laptop that finally crapped out and based on reviews, I decided to get this tablet.

This Dock is an OEM Samsung product. Works great when I use the tablet as a mini PC at home.Purchased the Samsung USB & SD Connection Kit EPL-1PLRBEGSTA from Amazon. Again the price was less than the price Samsung wanted and all the contents were OEM Samsung products.Both the Dock and Connection Kit connectors fit the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 connector perfectly and were easy to disconnect from the tablet.I purchased the i-BLASON Leather Case Cover in black that fits this tablet like a glove. All necessary areas of this case cover necessary to access the tablet controls and access points are available. This is a premium leather case and is well made.

Overall, not a bad tablet.  The sound quality is quite good.  Better than the Asus. Two major draw back is where they put the SD card slot and the power plug. They would have been better on the side.  It's kind of difficult to take the SD card in and out when you have the tablet in the case.  The other problem is that the power plug is on the bottom of the tablet.  So it makes it difficult to charge the tablet as you are watching a movie. Over time I think the USB cord will have to be replaced because the tension will cause the USB cord to brake. When compared to the Asus Memo pad (279.99) this has a slower processor and I believe less RAM. But the Asus tablet has a issue with dying on you. Also the Tab 2 blocks apps not downloaded from Google.  So you have to change this in the settings.

Most of what I think of it has already been said in the prior positive reviews and I did this review primarily to add a little info that some might find useful.1. Adobe flash WILL work. You have to download the the latest flash from a third party, install it and use a browser that supports flash (stock browser, Dolphin, Firefox). Chrome, unfortunately, does not support flash so it's a no go. Just do a google search for more details. Works fairly well but has some issues.2. IMPORTANT If you have a micro SD card loaded make sure you unmount if before updating the Android operating system. If you don't there's a good chance it won't work after the update. Mine was set to automatically update and after the update to Jelly Bean and subsequent reboot my tablet would no longer read my card correctly (reads fine in other devices though).Update: 1/6/14I'm still impressed with this device and have had no major issues. It has, however, slowed down since the update to ICS 4.2.2 and is not quite as zippy as it once was. For anyone interested in USB audio out, I tried to get this working with an OTG cable, Hifimedia DAC, headphones and USB pro audio player. It sorta works. It plays the audio but frequent pops and other glitches make this non viable.

It's extremely easy to use and very efficient. It uses the Google Play Store. The camera is reversible and takes clear pictures. But, it doesn't have a lot of ways to edit pictures, other than the basics and filters. The software is Android 4.2, it's the \"Jellybean.\" The display is amazing! It comes with a USB cord, too. It also comes with Bluetooth that's already installed. A feature I really enjoy is adding G.B. All you do is buy a new SD card , put it in, and you have more G.B. instantly. It also has great resolution: 1,280 x 800 pixels. The size is great. It's nice and thin, but not so thin that it'll fall out of your hands. It's simple to transport, too. The sound is crisp, clean, and not fuzzy. You can do downloads very easily. Downloads include fun things, such as, movies, music, videos, games, and much more! The Play Store doesn't supply you with every app that Apple has, but it has most of them. I would recommend this product to someone who needs a computer that isn't very big. Another nice feature is, if it's loading slowly, you can stop running other apps by going to \"Settings.\" The battery, time, date, notifications, settings, and more can be accessed by tapping the bottom right corner.

I have had this tablet for a month now, and I'm still just scratching the surface on customizing it; recently been having fun with live wallpapers, gaming, etc. Just completely functional fun, and works very well pairing with a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse 5000 and Logitech/Zagg Bluetooth keyboard case (the aluminum one from Amazon). I'd suggest getting a 2 port USB wall charger, because if you're like me, this will be sitting next to your bedside on a table alongside your Android smartphone, and you'll be able to charge them both on that one adapter overnight to 100%.

I thought this hit a sweet spot for me.  As a 10\" tablet, it has the good screen size to watch movies or TV or just to surf the internet on.  The speed of the tablet will depend on how many widgets you have running at a given time.  Widgets can be very appealing since they can display information you want to see regularly right in the main desktop window.  They can be visually appealing since they help breakup the look of a page from just being a list of icons.  The downside is they can use up a lot of memory, just remove a couple widgets you won't normally use, and the tablet performs just fine.  For better or worse (and arguments can be made on both sides), you can only use Widgets on Android and not on iOS.Watching videos is a very good experience.  While you don't have the access to iTunes videos or Amazon Instant, you do have access to Google Play for movies and TV and can download apps for Hulu Plus, Netflix, Vudu and Flixster (Ultraviolet).  I used Flixster to download and watch some of the movies I have Ultraviolet copies of thanks to the BluRay, and it works great.  The movies load fast and look really good.  It is great to have access to my movies while on the go.  Each movie can be streamed over Wi-Fi or downloaded at 800 MB to 1.2 GB of size each.  As with all Tablets, wach your space as videos can eat it up quickly.Speaking of storage space, the tablet comes with 16GB of memory installed, and this is a pretty good size and can last you bit.  However, unlike the iPad the Galaxy Tab 2 has a slot to insert a micro SD card.  I happen to have an extra 16GB from an old android phone and now have a full 32 GB available.  That expand-ability is a nice feature.  Overall construction is good, it feels more solid than the Galaxy S phone, has a good weight and seems pretty durable so far.You give up the iTunes App store, but gain Google Play.  Review what is available in each and make your own decision, but I did not find anything that would be a dealbreaker.  All in all, my wife has the iPad 2, and now I have the Galaxy Tab 2 and for my purposes, I think the Galaxy is a great alternative and better suits my personal needs for a tablet.EDIT: I forgot to mention that I purchased a Refurbished product.

I refuse to spend that kind of money on a product that will just be replaced in 6-9 months with a \"new and improved\" version that adds another $100 onto the purchase price.

I had originally considered going with the 7\" model, but I do tend to watch movies on my tablets so the larger version seemed optimal for that reason alone.

Between the great size, speed at which it connects and wakes up, to the overall ease of use--- she admitted that she really likes it. For me since I use an Android powered phone, it was refreshing to have something that felt native and easy to integrate with all of our gear. The other good part is that when we travel or go anywhere, I hotspot my phone and she has 4G or 4G LTE speed internet. For that alone, she likes it as I can drive and she can surf--- and if she finds someplace we want to go and needs directions--- key up Google maps and navigation and you're good to go.Battery life has exceeded my expectations by far. I know that there may be better displays out there, but for the features and price this is a very solid tablet. I also like the fact that it is light and most websites display as they would on a PC. To date no drawbacks and if it weren't for a handful of programs that I run... I'd get one for work. We have put off on getting one for a while and compared to others that I have seen (mainly  the iPad) it definitely above it in terms of quality and functionality. There will always be an i-anything group of followers and I am definitely not one of them. I was going to go for a Lenovo tablet, but I couldn't resist the price and with Samsung seeming to do us well as far as phones, TV's, and even appliances... it was only natural.Although I did not purchase it through Amazon, I still wanted to leave a review. Their price is fine and honestly I would have, but I walked into our local Costco and as an impulse of sorts to do it right then and there--- I bought it.

I loved the Ipad 2. Very refined and stable. Now, I'm a big android fan and decided to get a tablet for work since android / samsung has improved greatly on their phones (I own a Samsung Epic 4G touch which is near perfect and blows apple iphone away).This new samsung tablet is almost there. It has everything you would want. Applications don't crash, very customizable. Good enough camera. But here is the thing. The graphics processor hesitates and stalls. The apps don't crash, the transitions hesitate and stall. The only browser that is good for watching integrated video is the chrome browser, and even that has issues (can't even compare with the ipad 2 when it comes to watching integrated video. ). The browsers (no matter which one you use) still lag and freeze with almost every website.If the tab didn't have the hesitation, the choppy transitions between apps /screens, and the browser lag, the tab would be perfect. Almost there! I may return it and wait for the quad core samsung to come out. we'll see. Also, avoid the Asus TF300. It lags, freezes, crashes, and is NOT touch responsive.

I also can no longer see the clock, battery usage, etc. when using many apps.  The worst thing though is that my Tablet will no longer shut down.  It just restarts when I attempt to shut it down.  This means that I will no longer be able to take it with me on airlines that require a complete shutdown of electronic devices.  Being that I use it for everything when I travel, I may get stuck having to buy some other tablet for travel purposes.  Finally, when I attempted to contact customer service to see if there was a way to shut it down, I kept being told by each department that they couldn't help me and then directed to another department where I got the same message.

Once you download the flash, it works flawlessly! The tablet it is pretty light, easy to nagivate and the setup was pretty easy. I am pretty computer savy and currently have the EVO 4G Android phone.

I noticed many prior reviewers comparing the Tab 2 to the iPad, and many others hadn't owned their Tabs as long as I've owned mine. I will start by saying that I am a bit of a techie and love cutting edge technology. I hate Apple, not because they aren't the best at what they do, but because I cannot afford them. When my birthday approached this past August I asked my girlfriend for an iPad, but due to the price I was told to make another choice ;) which is when I decided on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.Be aware that Apple is the holy grail of tablets, bar none! They created the market and redefine it every year. When Samsung, Asus & et.al, make a new tablet they compare it to Apple's current generation iPad. When Apple releases a new generation iPad, they have to compare it to their current generation iPad. Both Apple and its competitors realize the standard is set by Apple; everyone else is vying for second place. Having established the Tab 2 will never be a serious competitor to any generation iPad, consider why it was created. Samsung created this item while being sued by Apple for design infringement. This tablet was created to avoid direct comparisons with the iPad. It was engineered to be adequate in all areas, so that could provide an affordable alternative to more high end tablets on the market, and it succeeds very well in that purpose.I have owned my tablet for a bit over 4 months now and it is truly a jack of all trades although, master of none. If you want to perform mobile gaming (distinct from social gaming due to a loss of flash support) this is a good option. Less hardware intensive games like Angry Birds play well on it, but I have purchased and played a few hardcore shooters on this Tablet and it handles games that are optimized for the Tegra 3 chipset even though this tablet does not have that technology within its build.As for media playback, this is a solid performer. It handles HD video, streaming video from Hulu +, Netflix and Vudu through an app call Flixster with ease. Songs (even those streamed through Google Music or Tunein Radio) and video sound great through the side offset speakers while the front and rear cameras do a respectable job at taking photos and engaging in face chat based applications such as Skype. There are even apps built into the device that allow sharing of media to Smart TVs as well as an IR blaster that allows you to control TVs, cable boxes and even a specific one for DirecTV.For productivity, there is a native Office-like App (Polaris) an email client that will sync with your work email and compatibility with Evernote, Dropbox and Google Drive. The plastic build of the Tab ensures a solid and stable connection to wifi, (even with weaker signals) built in expandable memory for presentations and a split keyboard option for extended typing sessions. There's even a security feature that allows you to track a lost/stolen tab through samsungdive.com.Overall this is a niche tablet that is designed for cost conscious customers who want a robust mobile experience whether it be for business or pleasure. It excels at being a mid-level entry. It is NOT a high end tablet. Apple creates products that have best in class screen resolution (except the Nexus 10) fastest processors and most durable products on the market. The big difference between the Apple and the Samsung is Apple gives most consumers more tech than they'll ever need, where Samsung allows consumers to decide how much to pay for their tech based on usage needs.", "Title": "Jack of All Trades", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Consumer Joe", "ReviewID": "R2Q5Q7QB9SZ641", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this table.

Unfortunately, Samsung just had to leave their mark on it. The from factor is nice. It's super light, and Ice Cream Sandwich looks good... almost.Android 4.0 and above is a very solid good looking operating system, so it baffles me why Samsung feels the need to dump their crummy \"enhancements\" all over it. Let's go over them-The settings screen is customized in a way that is inconsistent with google's own UI guidelines for android-The bottom bar has an added \"screenshot\" button. I might be unique, but I don't really need a screenshot button that can be pressed at a moment's notice. How about a settings button instead?-There is a lame OS X style app drawer that pops up at the bottom of the screen. I can't customize it, and it doesn't seem to do anything useful.-Samsung breaks the simple colors of the holo theme by adding random colored icons into the notification and battery area. Android looked fine without them.-Samsung's UI adds bugs into android. I write android apps for a living, and we have to test specifically on samsung devices because their customizations break our apps in strange ways.The long story short is this tablet would have been great if it ran stock android. Samsung made it substantially worse by putting their mark on it. If you want a solid android tablet, get a Nexus 7 instead.

I should have waited...It's not that I hate this pad, but knowing what is soon to be released is why I should have waited. Again, I don't hate it overall but I do hate certain aspects of it.  I'm going to go a little backwards here and list the cons since they are the reason for this review.The keyboard: I can't tell you how frustrating the auto correct is. It makes even entering passwords a chore. Typing on this thing is like hearing fingernails across a blackboard. Turn off the auto correct you say? Well, it's actually more of a headache than having it on.Samsung Apps: I have to mention the music player. I cannot believe the developers even use this app.  It's horrible. Try to shuffle songs from a certain artist.  It usually took me three minutes to get it going, no exaggeration. Also, it grouped my Google voiemails in with my music when on shuffle play. So, I'd get to randomly listen to my voiemails in between songs. Annoying!Performance: this thing really lags. Scrolling is really choppy and the touchscreen doesn't respend often.Ok, now for some nice things about it:Screen: great brightness when needed. I like the auto brightness setting a lot. Not a retina display, but nice.Design:  sharp looking, feels good in hands.Ok, I need to wrap this up. Again, I don't hate this pad but it is frustrating to operate. Really, I think most of the .problems with it are poor user interface on many of the Samsung Apps. I know I can load a new music player but I'm rating this thing as is.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi) has so many neat features. But by far the biggest selling point for me is the battery life. I recently took a 6 hour road trip. Let me tell you the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 kept my kids occupied for most of the trip. It was a lifesaver. They were having a ball playing games and watching movies. Plenty of juice left on the battery after 6 hours. I don't know about Apple iPad battery life but Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 performed quite well. I also love the built-in IR Blaster, you can watch and control your TV right from your tablet. So you get a smart remote that would cost a few hundred dollars alone.The only thing I didn't like was the fact that description stated it was compatible with Adobe flash sites. However, when I first tried to get on a site running flash I got a message saying this site doesn't support your device. I was able to find a plug in to run Adobe flash. I think it's called \"Adobe flash 11.1 plugin\". Once the flash issue got resolved everything was smooth sailing.

The boxes were very professional and purpose designed so they managed the trip to Australia with no problems.We are delighted with these units and they represent good value for money.  Highly recommended.Only one cautionary note to do with shipping. I used a third party shipper and got caught when they charged the shipping based on volume, as they are allowed to do, instead of weight. So the overall shipping cost doubled and almost wiped out the savings.  But as these units (wi fi only) are very scarce in Australia - like almost non-existent - then there was little choice but to buy from overseas.Would we do it again? - yes we would.

My husband had the smaller 7 inch version, and loves his. After lots of debate, reading reviews and finally 'pick a hand', I chose this model. When it first arrived, I was in love. It was fun having a larger touch screen than on my phone, and I could read everything so much more clearly. The sound is actually better than my laptop, and it's lightweight and turns on/boots up lightning fast. But then I noticed...After comparing with my husband's 7\" model, I noticed that my pictures were not as clear as his. The smaller version had the better display.When surfing, I noticed that many things wouldn't load properly. Gmail opened at first, but then the screen would refresh by the millisecond as if it couldn't completely load. I couldn't see it at all in the standard Firefox browser, so I downloaded Dolphin. The Dolphin browser did allow me to read gmail, but that browser frequently just closes up for no reason.The battery cable attachment is inconveniently located at the base of the tablet. So it's hard to have it on my lap and plugged in at the same time, because I don't like to press up against the cable and bend it. However, the battery life is excellent, so it's not often that I'm faced with having to plug it in while I'm using it.EDITED to ADD: Most people won't have an issue with this. Thanks to a comment on the review, I realize that most people will just turn the tablet the other way. I've got mine in a very snug case that fits most comfortably one direction longways - and I'm a \"widescreen person\" which is why I bought the larger 10 inch screen.The screen response to my finger is not nearly as sensitive as on my phone. Sometimes I have to tap a field many times just to get the keyboard to pop up, and sometimes it still doesn't recognize my tapping, and I just give up and move on to something else.Overall I'd give it a Meh.", "Title": "So close, yet so far", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Alexandre Guimaraes \"GUIMA\"", "ReviewID": "R3FY8DXPRGCLGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung is the best phone/tablet company.The only cons that i found is that it doesnt support flash and the sites see it as a phone, not as a computer.", "Title": "great tablet", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Madeline Lebron", "ReviewID": "RBNS74Y2J1ZMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this one better that the IPad.

I purchased 2 Marquis MP977 tablets from Amazon and one from ebay and all 3 were DOA when received. Went through hell on earth getting those straightened out and getting refunds because in every case, the manufacturer said to send it back to the seller for a refund or replacement. But I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 at auction and it took right off with blazingly great performance as soon as I got it home. Everything was perfect. the only thing that I was disappointed with was that it only had Android 4.0.1 (Ice Cream Sandwich) installed because I know through several friends and reviews that the later version 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) had much greater capability and stability. BUT, this thing was running so well that I was willing to overlook this as a minor drawback. Much to my surprise, three days after cranking up the Galaxy, I had it connected to my WiFi and registered it with Samsung and Google Android. Immediately after registration, the unit went into an automatic upgrade mode which I believed was just to assure that all the utilities were up-to-date. It seemed a little slow but I didn't mind all that much and finally it gave up all its extra activity and said that it was through and turned the system back over to me. Being a little concerned, I went to check out the system state and what I found astounded me. Although the update did all that I thought it would do, I was almost bowled over to discover that the operating system was now up to 4.1.1. After a thorough check on installed packages, there were more useful system packages than I had ever hoped for. I had a like new, state-of-the-art tablet that was performing at breakneck capability and speed. All this and I never even asked for anything. What a difference in company support!!!Angers me now over the fact that I went cheap to start with in getting the Marquis tabs and I think that I have learned a lesson. The BIG plus is; I'm so happy now with the Galaxy that it makes up for all the misery I went through.

I've owned the original 7 in tab which was nice but too expensive and slightly under performing compared to this tablet. I also own the Toshiba 10 inch tablet and the Samsung 7 inch Tab 2 which are OK but really are not in  the same league. This tablet outperforms these other tablets in just about every way. The other tablets had either short battery life, were too slow or not as responsive as the Tab2 10 inch.This tablet is very sharp, easy to read, very responsive and the battery life is spectacular compared to the other tablets I use. Is this good enough to replace a notebook or laptop? I don't think so. I've seen tablets used in very creative and productive ways but it can't replace my desktop or laptop. I find even my old very slow net book will outperform this tablet and any other Tablet (surface excluded). This tablet is just a great electronic toy that is also very useful for web surfing, video, displaying camera images, and a 1000 other uses. I think most purchases of a tablet will use it as a very portable computer which it is but not their sole computer. There are so many application for its use most of which I haven't discovered yet.The best thing about this tablet is it works almost as well as the very best tablet out there but is now very reasonably priced. Why spend $500 or more for a tablet that will be replaced in 2 years. I mention this period because the batteries are not user serviceable and it's life is unknown (probably 2-3 years)The tablets available in the next few years may match laptop power of today, who knows.Overall I like the Tablet a lot. I use it along with my Kindle for reading, Pandora, driving a creative stereo speaker via Bluetooth, checking email, a few games, Amazon, and Netflix, and viewing my cameras digital images which works out great in the field. I could use it more but I like using my big 17 laptop with 17 core, 8 GB memory, Windows 7 and big solid state drive. It boots much faster than the tablet between 5 and 15 seconds. If you are tired of long boot times on your computer try a SSD, you will be pleasantly surprised.If you love Apple products, you may not like this Android device, however if you have any Android phone, I feel confident you will probably really like and be glad you bought this tablet.

I checked Amazon reviews, CNET, PC World, comments in forums, and finally decided on this tablet. I've had it about three weeks. Learning has been an adventure, but I am a \"user\" even if I don't understand the difference between Jelly Beans, Ice Cream Sandwiches and Gingerbread (other than how they look and taste! haha). Seriously, those things don't mean anything to me so they don't matter. I had a list of things that did:play movies, play games, be able to write & save it, needed a USB port for flash drives and ebook capability if I wanted it (do not have one nor have I wanted one - I prefer real books).So I got this Samsung. Graphics are beautiful but I do use powersave mode so I keep it a bit dimmed most of the time. Still, the visuals are fab. The audio? No complaints. I've downloaded the Amazon cloud app and listen to my cloud music while I write. I downloaded Dropbox app from Google Play Store and am using it for writing and storage. Tablet came with Polaris Office but it kept shutting down on its own so I ditched it in favor of DropBox. (I understand that Kingston Office is avail free too, just in case others were wondering. I wanted to do MS Office docs so this was one reason I did not go to the Apple side).I purchased an adapter plug for the available port so I can plug in my flash drives to download and use files. I haven't done it yet but I now have the ability to do so. I also got a longer plug with wall adapter for charging. Beware cheaper plug options, they often do not fit tightly in the tablet. Get xtras directly from Samsung as I did. No problems with anything. (Some advertisements say the products are for Galaxy Tab 10.1. Be SURE it specifically says Tab 2 10.1 - P5113).What I'm mad about is the lack of a Flash Player!  One of the reasons I got this tablet instead of Apple was its ability to play Flash. Well I was wrong. You can't. It is no longer supported (there is a work-around to download an older version of Flash which I intend to do). Samsung should have said this up front and I feel cheated that they didn't. I can't watch some YouTube vids or any Amazon movies because there's no flash!!  And I wanted the movies as one of my main reasons for having this while traveling.I've played a few games. And I have downloaded Chrome instead of the installed \"browser.\" Everything seems to work fine, no lagging or dragging.I also got a Kensington Pro bluetooth keyboard/case. Fabulous accessory. So I'm totally portable, much more so than with my 17\" laptop.I do really like this tablet. I'm disappointed in having to do a Flash workaround because I feel this info was deliberately kept from us (But that's on Samsung, not Amazon). I will say that I got the HBO.Go app and I did watch Game of Thrones from HBO. It played perfectly.For anyone who isn't geek oriented but wanted a tablet with ease of use and portablity, I think you will like the options and quality of this Samsung.

Many tablets have 16GB of internal memory (with half used by the operating system) and tha'ts it. This one let me put in a 32GB external SD card, giving me a tablet with massive storage for an extra $15 (cost of the SD card)The battery life is VERY strong. I charge this about once a week.

Now that I've used the Galaxy 3 for a few months, it's served an incredibly useful purpose, as a companion to my work, and as an essential part of my leisure time.I'm pretty familiar with the Mac OS and have had an Android phone in the past, so using this tablet out of the box took mere moments.  Keep in mind, this is an indispensable tool and I'd be ridiculous not to acknowledge that I'm pretty set in my ways for what I use for what purpose.I primarily use my phone to upkeep on my social media, although Facebook is pretty much up for grabs.  Using it on the Galaxy Tab is a pretty solid experience.Streaming video has been a wonderful experience on the Galaxy Tab.  Although the sound is fairly low without an external speaker or headphones, the picture is crisp.  I primarily use it for Netflix and HBO Go, and would use it for Amazon Streaming if and when an app is released.Reading has been primarily accomplished in the past by my Nook.  Since the Galaxy Tab also has a Kindle app, there really isn't anything that I can't read on this thing.  And everything opens as it should; making the experience simple.I've always been mixed on reading comics on a screen.  I'm not a fan of the Comixology navigated view, but reading books via their regular app, PDF and cbr/cbz files has been pretty fantastic.  Navigation is smooth, and it's easy enough to sit down and read for a bit.I've also used it for shopping (Amazon primarily) and unlike the fruit named tablet, a big caveat is the ability to add memory via a SIM card.  The touch screen is a bit too sensitive, and personally, I found the battery life to be far shorter than I'd expect when just reading.  The placement of the two buttons also tends to cause a number of accidental presses.  The lack of ability to sync to my iTunes account is another disappointment.For me, the Galaxy Tab works, and does so as a secondary/tertiary device.  It delivers, but nothing is particularly amazing; it's just good enough.  The large number of apps available is attractive, but ultimately I found it to be an excellent supplement to my digital arsenal rather than a primary device.", "Title": "Solid Introductory Tablet", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jonnathan Duarte", "ReviewID": "R3AV56WYTPYAYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good product is what I needed met my expectations. thanks for apoyo.espero in future keep buying good as the one I bid produtos", "Title": "fino", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Author": "Marius", "ReviewID": "R2RSR7KZLLQLSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (it was like 100 usd cheaper than the new one) but it was exactly like new.

I got it to study during my breaks at work and when I took a job overseas, of course it came with me. It went everywhere with me.Then the display started blinking to funny colors--all neon green, yellow, orange and pink. Just occasionally at first, then it just stuck there. So movies became a thing of the past. But the screen only glowed an ugly mustard yellow while using Kindle, so it was fine (if a bit unpleasant on the eyes) for reading. I contacted Costco to obtain my purchase information from them since the warranty has two months to go, but the receipt is packed into a storage unit in California and I'm in the Middle East.Then this morning it died. Oh, it responds to the power button. It glows a very dark grey. It makes the appropriate noises for rebooting too. But charging it, rebooting it, and resetting it to the factory default has no effect. The screen turns dark grey and remains blank as a slate. It's hard to troubleshoot a product when you can't see anything on the screen. I went ahead and called Samsung internationally because I'd received the purchase information via email. I would rather not go into my customer service experience there, but I will say I do not intend to buy Samsung again.

Some applications which I favor on my Samsung Droid phone did not transfer as they are currently not compatible with the Tablet (Example CamScanner and others). Note that \"Amazon Prime Instant Video\"  content is not currently supported on this Tablet. However, Netflix is supported.I removed the factory default home screen widgets (Game Hub, Movie Hub) as these are not important to me and replaced the home screen with application shortcuts, widgets and desktop background of my choice.The Tablet is a great \"convenience\" bridge between my laptop and Samsung Droid phone. For some applications, I prefer using the Tablet's  larger screen rather than using the phone.The HD display is stunningly crisp and clear for watching movies or for reading books. Netflix streams flawlessly on the Tablet and the picture quality is ...stunning. The virtual keyboard is very precise and responsive even though I have the Otterbox screen protector over the screen.The built in camera is unimpressive in picture quality but I did not purchase the Tablet to be a camera. I have Nikon Pro DSLRs for that purpose.I did find that file transfer to the external microSD card was painfully slow but solved that issue by removing the card from the Tablet and doing my file transfers to the card while it is in a card reader instead. (32GB Class 10 microSD).Overall, I love the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 considering the price point of the product. It it simply a great product.Update: June 28...

There was not good reason for the iPad to fail, as it was never abused and hardly ever left our home.  My wife was typing away on her iPad when it suddenly FROZE.  The Apple Genius diagnosed the problem as a failure of the internal Sold State Drive.  No reason given and 2 months after the warranty ended.  So I researched options to replace it.  Best option was to sell the nonfunctioning unit on Gazelle ($68) and apply that to purchase a new Galaxy Tab 2.  The Tab 2 is every bit as nice as the iPad.  It's about the same weight and size and similar battery life.  The screen is slightly higher res on the Tablet too.  One thing we like better about the Tab 2 is that it functions more like a PC.  No need to stumble through iTunes for those of us who prefer PCs.  You can add files and move them just like you can on a PC.  It has more memory because of the SIM card that can be added and it's less costly than an iPad.  Frankly, as an owner of Apple stock, I don't know why they haven't improved the iPad more after all these copy cat products came out.  They ought to at least offer USB support, something missing from both of these tablets.", "Title": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 2", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R1DOAAB56HZGOS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet is very possibly better than the iPad.

Basically, if you're happy with Samsung, then you'll love this, and maybe even if you're an Apple Fan.  The Price is right.  The Twin Speakers on the Sides are Pretty Good, not Over Powering, but you're going to plug in your Stereo Earphones on the plane anyhow.  Wi-Fi works wonderfully, and tethers from another Cell Phone well.  The 1080 HD Screen is very Sharp and Crisp with Vibrant Colors.  There's not much of a Camera here, but I bought it to view in the Living Room while watching TV, and find out the Filming Location on IMDb, and to Track Shipments and to read Email.  Once, you get a Tablet, you wonder how did you survive without one, and then you find that no matter how big your Cell Phone's Screen is, it's nothing compared to viewing anything on the 10 inch Tablet, I take the Tablet to Church, and read from Olive Tree's Bible with a Lexicon from Spiros Zodhiates Complete Study Bible, or I Tether it to my Cell Phone and my family Watches SlingBox in the car.  With Sywpe or Google Voice Typing or other Speech to Text Recognition Software, you almost don't need a KeyPad anymore.The Amazon Tablet app works on this Tablet, but let's just say Bye-bye to the No-Frills, No Icons Limited Page Mobile Apps, and you'll be glad to note that you can run everything including Amazon on this Tablet in it's Native Internet Explorer or Google Chrome Window, with Full Pictures and such. And you can set BookMarks on the New Internet Page.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is running Android Version 4.1.1, (Jelly Bean#, so it does all the Tricks you're used to, like organizing Folders, and bringing up all Active Apps.  Reading with Kindle or watch a YouTube Video is so more better than on the Cell Phone.  The Unlock Screen gives you Four Choices, Google Search Plus Weather, Tracking, Stocks ; Video Gallery, Internet, Picutre Gallery.  And this Comes with AccuWeather, and it's pretty easy to set up several different Email Accounts.  The 1.0 Dual Core Processor seems fast so far.Cons:Old School DOS Structure is gone, and is a little more Difficult to go to a Drive just using the Drive Letter. Example, #instead of just switching from C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents to J:\\Users\\Public\\Documents, I now have to go to the Drive 1st to Computer\\GT-P5113\\Card\\Users\\Public\\Documents#.  I had to Change some of my BackUp Batch Files to represent the new File Structure.You probably want to get a Leather Case for it, as the back was Slippery and it's sort of heavy.  CrazyOnDigital Stand Leather Case with Charger and Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 #6-item#The Calulator is not as Good as I would Like, but it's the Stock Samsung Calculator, #I use and highly Recommend getting the RDev Calculator App).It was nice to have the Alarm Clock back with the \"Good Morning\" Melody, as I had gotten my Cell Phone prior to the Samsung Galaxy S III, so I have a Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX, and I had to import the \"Good Morning\" Melody into it and had DownLoaded Alarm Clock Extreme, so I now got both.Which reminds me, The Cool thing is that all my Apps that I had DownLoaded started DownLoading to the Tablet, and except for SlingBox, which had a different App for the Android Tablets than for the Android Cell Phones.and I didn't have to reinstall all my Bible Apps.  I did have to put in the User ID and Password,And I put a SanDisc 64Gb Ultra Micro SDXC in mine, and the Tablet picked it up and runs fine even in the exFat Format, now I have 80Gb.

Consumer Reports listed the Galaxy Tab 2 as a great value and recommendation.3. We planned on using it for email, browsing the web, and watching videos and are not heavy gamersAfter using the tablet for a month or two, we love the look and feel. The picture is clear and bright and the sound is decent.The battery life is great, my kids can spend a couple hours watching videos and it will still be at 85% power.Every game we've downloaded has run smoothly and works perfectly. The kids have a blast with it.I have tried the iPad 2 and 3 and must say that it is much faster and more responsive than the Galaxy, however it is also $200 more.The Galaxy can use a micro SD card so memory is not an issue. Also, with the latest Android update, the screen has been much more responsive and everything is loading faster. Browsing works great and so does email. I use an iPhone and love the iOS operating system, but after using Android I must say it is just as good (maybe better if you consider that you can use 3rd party apps to do almost anything).All in all, it's a great deal if you want a table to leave in the kitchen for calendar, looking up recipies at dinner, or moderate gaming with the kids.

My girlfriend bought it for me for christmas 2012 after doing a ton of research that I didn't know about. Usually I would be horrified if she bought me any electronics but when I opened the SGT2 10.1 (5113) and set it up I almost proposed on the spot. First some background, I recently completed my Masters in Comp. Sci I wanted an android tablet to do some software development. At first glance the tab hit a home run. The IR port made me dizzy with happiness, the micro-SD slot caused a single, glistening tear of joy to roll down my cheeks, youtube worked out of the box, and my private collection of classic movies (streamed over my home network) never looked better. The last time my GF saw me on Christmas day was two minutes after I opened my SGT2 10.1.But then issues started to rear their ugly heads. During the initial setup Android decided to install all of the apps that I use on my Nexus One on the SGT2. For reasons I can't explain this immediately caused the Tab to lose sound and the ability to play all videos (they'd be extremely choppy with no sound). After googling around I did a factory reset and did *not* let Google sync my android devices. The video problem did not (immediately) come back.Then I decided to make use of the IR port. Samsung has an IR remote control app, it's name I've now forgotten, that comes with the Tab that I used to configure my Denon Audio receiver, my Tivo HD, my Samsung Bluray player and my Mitsubishi DLP TV. They all worked well enough but not perfect. I'll give it say a B- but it wasn't a deal killer. I figured if Samsung didn't get it's act together I'd write a remote control android app myself.Then after about 8 hours of using the tab for everything under the sun, the battery was still only at 40%, amazing, but I didn't want to run out of juice so I figured I'd plug it in while I kept working/playing. Samsung in their wisdom decided to send what feels like a 1ft power cable with the device. I say 1ft because I could not find one place in my house where I could have the Tab plugged in *and* use it at the same time. To make matters worse, samsung does *not* seem to sell an official Samsung 6-8ft cable. The only one's I could find were 3rd party and I don't really like using $0.99 third party junk on my $400 tab. Of course non of this would be a problem if samsung stopped using garbage proprietary connecters and just went standard micro-usb with docking pins.So I ended up using the device on the ground while plugged in and started looking for  the accessories that I'd need: docking station, HDMI adaptor and a case.I'll start with the docking station. After begin totally frustrated with how difficult it was to find the official Samsung dock for this device I decided to just buy the Samsung Galaxy Desktop Dock (EDD-D1B1BEGXAR) Turns out that it's only compatible with the SGT (1) 10.1 and *not* the SGT2 10.1. It ALMOST fits for the SGT2 but not actually. You can force it if you like but this is the reason I like looking for official devices so that they just work.Next was the HDMI adaptor Samsung EPL-3PHPBEGXAR Galaxy Tab HDTV Adapter. It turns out that's it's a lesson in frustration. Not only did samsung, in their total lack of wisdom, not include the HDMI connector in the dock but they don't make it clear that it doesn't work on all SGT2's only the 5113 model has the HW for a second display. This I learnt at the XDA forums. So even though I got lucky, as a developer something else snagged me that I haven't been able to  find anywhere else on the net. When I plug the HDMI adaptor in the Tab doesn't see both data and power, only power. Which made it impossible to do USB debugging during android development.Now this minor detail doesn't concern most tablet users but what should concern anyone looking at purchasing this tablet or any other devices from samsung is that even the Samsung app store stuff didn't download after notifying me of an update. Everything Samsung related on the Tab feels like it wasn't thoroughly tested. There is a consistent level of not-quite-ready with the experience that I've had with this tab that is clearly on the Samsung side of things. I'm pretty much invested in the Google ecosystem and want to continue down that path, even though I do have the iPod and a macbook pro is my daily machine. But at this point there is a noticeable lack of quality control that Samsung has that is sorely needed.This tablet is close enough in HW specs to challenge anything out there, however Samsung is not yet ready to be the big boy in town yet, they are the best that Android has to offer outside of the Nexus line. So I'll be getting my refund and holding on to my (girlfriend's) money until I can find something better.", "Title": "Really dissapointed", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RT898HU0GWW2H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In order to cut the price by $100, this tablet has lower hardware spec than the first generation Samsung 10-inch tablet.

However, it seems every time I want to use it for something, there is always some kind of limitation that prevents it from performing as well as I would like it to. When I first got it, I thought it would change my life! But, in reality, it sits in a closet, useless.My first disappointment was realizing there is no reasonable way to use it in class to take notes. Samsung did a very good job of making sure one must buy the Galaxy NOTE Tab (or an iPad) for that function.Second disappointment: I haven't been able to find a decent keyboard to use with it. It's not an iPad, so it seems to me desirable accessories are few and far between. And, anyway, my laptop keyboard works great.Third disappointment: I haven't been able to figure out how to connect it to my TV. I was hoping I would be able to use it to watch HBO Go on a TV.Fourth disappointment: There is no USB nor Mini-USB slot.Fifth disappointment was learning this tablet cannot scan barcodes. It has a 3-megapixel fixed-focus camera. Because of those limitations, the camera is unable to focus on barcodes, therefore, unable to scan them. There is supposedly a workaround of putting a magnifying glass over the tab's lens. Ridiculous.The one somewhat useful function I once used it for was to download and read a digital version of a fiction book required for class. I am PRETTY SURE it will work as a Point of Sale cash register (but without being able to scan items). It also has a cool factor, which keeps hope alive that someday I will be able to find a significant use for it. But, overall, there doesn't seem to be much point to having this tablet.

Samsung is loaded, loaded, loaded with game apps, I'll never use.  Checking status of accounts, reading, shopping, very minute tasks are a breeze, the battery life is long.  In the begining I kept receiving update notices for every app.  How outdated can they be??? I did manage to down load eprint from hewlett packard wireless printing, otherwise printing is not accomodated unless it's via a samsung printer.  *** 4 out of 5 in my household have ipod touch, they say my tablet is weird, odd ball I know, but when the two year warranty ends and this dies .... actually before it dies, I just might go ahead and get full size HP.  It's always easier to get used to more than less .... I want more, I want more!  Don't discount the positive reviews, it may suit your purposes supremely.  At a time when we think we're at the height of technological progress ... there are those who produce software according to what is right in their own minds.  On an occasion when I considered downloading an app a little robot appears if I choose it a window appears and essentially says samsung does not approve it .... on an other occasion of a download it  asked \"prove to me you're not the robot.\" ; )", "Title": "re-orientation!!!", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jean Leach", "ReviewID": "R2NLA9HK1UYZ8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do like it but have some problems with it.

First off, I was promised Flash support (full support for Adobe Flash Player 10.1 for accessing Flash-enabled websites), but that was when Ice Cream Sandwich was out, but Jelly Bean was fast on its way. Now Adobe has pulled its support, unless you just don't want to update your tablet. There are workarounds, but it entails installing rogue APKs and then they only work with certain apps.I tried to like the built-in Samsung keyboard, but not with its native Swype. So I downloaded the Swype Beta app and it's awesome! I used to have an iPad and absolutely hated having to tap out words and worry about auto-correct. Now, I can slide my finger around the virtual keyboard. You may still have to add your personal words, and it will offer to save them in its built-in dictionary. Hey, it's one of those rogue APKs, but it works on pretty much all software in the tablet, so I'm good.This tablet is about the price and specs comparable of a used iPad 2. But it's much more open-source as far as adding your music, photos, apps and videos. You can either use Kies or simply plug your tablet up to the USB slot of your computer and drag them over. Also, the microSD can handle a 64GB card! I took my card out of my Galaxy S3 and popped it in with no problems. All of my music was there and it reported correctly storage usage and space available.Now for the cons: Every once in awhile, the edges feel a little loose like there's a bit of screen separation. Sliding it into a case helps big time. But the charging jack is on the side and facing the inside spine of the case. This means that you have to leave your case open when charging and it can get dusty. Also, there is a dreaded copy/paste bug that has plagued Samsung devices for over a year now. Your device will randomly soft reboot after a copy/paste or just crash altogether. There are other occasional crashes and freezes, but they're very rare, at least in my case.I did have one problem during setup: don't change the time-zone so that it can set itself up. If you do, you will get an internal clock error. Just let it do its thing and then when you login to your Google account, it will auto update your clock and Sync up everything.

As I said in the begining the camera does not auto focus which makes close up pictures a little fuzzy. I downloaded a gocery app the can scan bar codes but that feature does not work because the camera cannot focus on the bar code.

NOTE...I HAVE THE MAX INTERNET SPEED MONEY CAN BUY ALSO..Checked with Amazon to have something done, i just missed my return window but I can sell my $299 mint condition tab back to them for $140, not happening. Called up Samsung to have somthing done, only to be told even thou under warranty,  I wolud have pay to ship & returned back to me. Even if I do all this, they cant guarantee that they will fix or replace it if they deem it work properly, i would hope this is not a properly working device because I would have to say this Samsung product & customer service SINKS & Amazon isnt any better for selling it on there website. As much money we spend on these products & being under warranty, we shouldn't be spending anymore to have problem devices fixed or taken care of by the sellers & manufacturer.

Overall, it's pretty good, however the included web browser is very sluggish (download and use Chrome instead) and the device does not come preloaded with the Jellybean 4.1.2 OS as advertised. What I've found disappointing is that Samsung's customer service is lousy, so don't believe what you read (about how good the customer service is) in other posts. I recently tried chatting with a Samsung rep. regarding access to Jellybean 4.1.2 and even sent the rep. the link to the product listing here in Amazon (which incorrectly shows the OS as 4.1.2). I was informed by the rep. that this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with Samsung!

Too bad?10:02 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): Hello Giavauna, my name is Aljen.10:02 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: Hello :)10:04 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): I'll be happy to check this for you.10:04 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: If that is the case then I guess I won't be making anymore purchases through Amazon, rather I should go back to Ebay. If I had no choice and if this problems exists again in the near future, what is that to say that Amazon is not trust worthy with online purchases anymore? Just saying10:07 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): I'm sorry for that this cause you.

No worries, I will note this on your account and make sure to forward it to the appropriate department.10:09 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: Alright, I thank you for that. Now what am I supposed to do, hang on to the item and save it as a souvenir from Amazon? I am sure I can try and sell it on Ebay.10:11 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): You're welcome. Once again, I'm sorry for this and cause you for the trouble of the item.10:13 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: Let me ask you this then. I'm not gonna run and hide from Amazon, but to better myself in future purchases, what would you recommend with future purchases that I won't have to go through this again? Any friendly suggestions?10:16 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: Also, the item I sent back for trade or whatever, I made certain there were no scratches as how it is kept from day of purchased, they are telling me that there are scratches on the item. Of course when I got it back, guess what I discovered, scratches. So was I set up?10:16 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): I see. I'm sorry that I can provide any details on our items on the website since all the items on the website are covered with 30 days return window. Also, all items are coming from our third party seller have the own shipping policy, restriction and return window policy.10:18 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: SO that means I can't escape the problem like I experienced so far?10:19 PM(GMT) Aljen(CSA): If you want I can send an email to the seller and ask them again to return the item to them. However, I can't promised you if they will give you an exception to return the item to them since the return window of the item is expired on their records.10:23 PM(GMT) Giavauna Nguyen: You can try but I'm not gonna even stress it. I mean what is the point. I am just gonna cut Amazon for a while and go back to Ebay. I could be back sooner than later. Never know. Of course this won't stop my feedback for the seller.

Still can't turn it off, and it still won't RUN key apps such as banking bill pay and others.Samsung and its proxies have been totally out of touch with reality on this horrible mess. They should be paying us $20 a day for holding on to what's an essentially useless product. Customer service is beyond useless. \"Sorry for the inconvenience\" - I've heard that far too often. Next time, I'll buy an Apple. For now our cheap Acer laptop will do. It is running just fine.*****It's now been a month since the Samsung/Android firmware update and there's still no fix from the supplier. Still have to go through the plug it in to shut it off rigamarole, and many of our must-used apps don't work. After reading reviews of the new iPad Air, i know what i will be buying instead of another Samsung.*****Update: It has now been two weeks + since we updated firmware. The device has not worked properly since that day, and is nearly non-functional.Samsung rep says there is no way to back up to previously firmware version. And Samsung/Google are working \"as fast as we can because we know a lot of people are upset.\" No s__t! You can see how hot customers are by checking the various forums.I cannot believe that a manufacturer and its software collaborator - Google/Android - would release an update so fraught with bugs and errors.Learned my lesson: iPad will replace this POS!*****We bought this device in hopes that it would replace our old Dell desktop. Not so fast, bucko.While it's handy to use sitting on a couch, and acts much like my (now broken) Samsung Galaxy S3 phone did, the tablet apps aren't nearly as intuitive. And we have never gotten it to connect to our wireless printer (we did make the connection with my MacBook and iPhone). So, it doesn't work to print selected emails as intended.Android recently dropped a software \"upgrade\" on it. The device has since become almost totally non-functional. To turn it off, we need to plug in the charger and hold the power key down for about a minute. On top of that, our banking app, YouTube and a few other oft-used apps have stopped working. I deleted them from the device and attempted to download new versions, but couldn't connect. No more billpay off the tablet. Called Samsung tech support but they were unable to help.So, I have bought an inexpensive laptop computer I hope will last 3 years or so.So, anyone want to buy a used Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 wi-fi?

Never owning a smart phone, or anything powered by android and being my most current tech device is a apple powerbook g4 PPC running Tiger, I am very confused as to why people would wish to own this piece of work.I received this item and, for one if you are not a \"Google Person\" don't even buy one, you will have to set-up Google account to do anything period!  Me I am a yahoo-ian and at 60 years old just enjoy news, a book and watching a movie on my top, and of course shop on amazon :)Right out of the box this tablet fails on so many levels it is sad that so many people have embraced this device, it is more technology stupid than a early 2000's ibook.1. Will not play flash movies or games unless you download, upgrade several items and if you watch amazon movies forget it, download & install new browser, download & installed outdated, unsupported flash and hope like hell it works, and the video is equal if not less than what plays on a Ibook, WOW, what a leap in technology.2. Will not print to anything , unless you download more crap and install it and pray it works.3. Does not come with any word processor to just type a note and woosh send it away to anyone, unless you download more crud and install it, and on and on again.4. Will not print unless you download and install and and and and and and5. If it crashes, and it will, you will have to do a factory reset and lose everything you have done to make this machine actually work for you.  Seriously this is a $250.00 machine that should work for you, not you have to do minutes, hours, days of work to get it to do anything for you, this thing is a joke and not a very good one at that and I am sure that the folks at Samsung are laughing all the way to the bank on this.O.K. enough of being a hard-case, I bought this so my wife and I could read e-books, watch movies, check mail and cruise the net, and listen to our music on the road, instead of lugging old and big and chunky laptop around.  Since Amazon does not support Apple PPC machines anymore, we cannot access e-books, but can do everything else, with much more ease than this machine, we decided to give it a try, and it's screen is beautiful, it has excellent battery life, speakers are great, touch screen is great unless you have fat fingers (like me) then it is a pain (so get the pen), it is a very well built excellent unit with front and rear cameras and accepts memory cards, everything anyone would want, but yet an operating system that takes me back to the future (less flux capacitor).  So in finals, if your a Google/Android person you will luv this machine, if you enjoy downloading and installing everything you need to get going, well go for it, if you want a machine that helps you, works for you, then forget it, stick with your windows, apple, whatever puter, save your money, for this is just a smart phone that doesn't make phone calls.Thanxs.Ordering a Kindle next (I know it is droid, but hey grandpa has to try,,, Right??)", "Title": "Really people, Really.... an old Ibook works better.....", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Martin Sweet \"Martin Sweet\"", "ReviewID": "R1K1142YC0L8ZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 16G came with a 'Find my Tablet' feature that will locate your tablet with Google maps should you misplace your tablet.

I have both an iPad 2 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I own a Galaxy S3 phone and have had other androids and iPhones. So I know each has advantages and disadvantages. I started out with the 7 in Galaxy after doing A LOT of research because I carry my iPad instead of my work laptop but as anyone with Apple knowledge knows, there are a few holes that an iPad can't fill in a PC business world. I immediately decided the 7 in was too small for my taste and replaced it after very little use for the 10.1 in version. Had I kept it longer, I might have discovered the major shortcomings and just sold it outright.I specifically bought the Samsung Tab 2 to be able to send attachments created in common programs such as word, excel, pdf, etc. The big selling point was the free versions of Polaris and other office products available through Google Play. For those who don't know, you can buy similar versions on the iPad, however, if you create a ppt for work on the iPad, you have to reformat if it will be shown on a pc once it is sent to the pc. Same with the other office like products. You also cannot \"browse\" and attach items such as resumes or files if you are on certain sites from Apple. So I specifically needed this on the Samsung. There are workarounds on iPad for sending attachments. On Samsung, there are no workarounds. It is just impossible. If you do a search on forums (which I should have done before) you will find that it is a common complaint and the developers do not seem inclined to address it. HUGE for a product using google (translation gmail) and yet you can't send a document via gmail from anywhere on the tablet.Still annoyed by that, I lost all copy and paste functionality. ???? Seriously??? Searched forums again. Widespread. It can be made to work intermittently by doing the hokey pokey or a seance, however, it will not last. Ever tried to copy some text so that you don't have to retype all of it....even iPad had this fixed in the very first update when there was a minor issue.Then there is all the talk about flash, java, whatever....I wasn't too worried as I primarily use the Tab for work stuff until I realized that even amazon videos, youtube content and many other standard types when you are doing a search and need a tutorial or watching the news are not supported. It also limits the amount of internet windows you can have open.It also has some function that keeps toggling between english and multi language on keyboards so that the alternative letters pop up, severely hampering my typing as you have to hit space, accept the change, then backspace to change it quite often.Add all of this to my latest inability to get a stylus (unless it is over 20 bucks and/or you root the device and download an app to make what the selling feature of the product was supposed to be) to take notes in apps designed to take notes. At my last meeting I was defaulted to my fat fingers and the note taker so that each 4 sentences took up a page. I was really looking forward to taking notes this way during meetings with clients.I also am less than thrilled with the proprietary charger plug but am not knocking off for this since Apple recently went to the thunderbolt plug on their new devices, essentially screwing everyone who owns older devices in the process.There are pros...which is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 1 that I would give for the lack of these items. The way it opens windows in the internet is really cool despite the limit. I like the auto open in new tab. It has a great interface and Apple and other UI designers could really learn a thing or two about back buttons. And aside from it pushing out unwanted ads and spam, google play does have a lot more free apps. Plus I have always applauded the availability of an external sd card although putting stuff on it or accessing it is not easy.For playing games, watching netflix and google play, this is a decent tablet and it competes with the iPad. I have been carrying both for work when I travel, hoping that I can rely on one or the other but so far the iPad is coming closer and that is a tragic shame give the proprietary nature of its product.

First off, I bought this because I didn't need a full laptop, or so I thought. The sales associates at the store said it was basically like a laptop except for the optical drive. When I got home I realized it was far from a laptop.the first thing I noticed was there was no manual. It was as if they expected you to know how to work everything from the beginning. Once you get into the programs there are no help menus and icons which are fairly ambiguous are used instead of simple words.  so it takes a few times pressing different icons and hoping you don't accidentally erase somethingbefore you know what the icons are for.secondly, when typing it tries to guess words for you which are mostly always wrong, and the only way 2 change something is to press on the screen instead of using arrow keys. This makes it incredibly difficult to pinpoint the cursor over your mistakes, and typically means that you must erase more letters or words then are really necessary. I am a stickler for good grammar and competent spelling, but I have nearly given up on it all because off this ridiculous tablet.next there is the issue of simple actions that are missing from basic programs. Take Polaris Office for example, you cannot send hey file through email. By the way that quote Hey on quote was supposed to be the letter a.  again there is no help menu to show you how to send these files through email.there is no flash available for the tablet so mini sites won't work.the tablet acts more like a large cell phone than a computer.lastly I cannot tell you how many times you have to press on the screen 4 a link to work. And then sometimes if you accidentally brush the screen it send you to a site you did not intend. I have written all of this using the speak to write app. Possibly the only half redeming quality on the tablet, except that yet obviously gets plenty of words wrong. 40 instance that 40 was supposed to be 4 the word, and the word yet in the previous sentence was supposed to be it.if you're simply looking for A device to use for apps, music, and searching the internet this would be a fine choice, however if you plan to write more than 3 emails stick with your laptop.", "Title": "worst purchase I've ever made", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Shawty27", "ReviewID": "RJ73XO1QBUVUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this product.

I cannot figure how this thing works, or what the designers were thinking. God help someone like my grandmother. I sat with a few coworkers, and we spent 5 minutes trying to figure how to go into the app store and download an app. Couldn't figure it out. Refused to consult a manual or Google it, so we just gave up. Fortunately this was a work owned tablet, so we didn't care. We both went back to our iPads and didn't look back. The iPad just works, whereas this tablet is work (as in a chore).(Some people reading this review haven't understood this is hyperbole. It's not that you literally can't figure out this tablet, it's that what takes 3 intuitive taps on an iPad takes 10 non-intuitive and wandering taps on this tablet).In terms of fit and finish, the button to actually turn on the screen is a tiny little invisible button around the trim ring. On an iPad, there is a big button on the front. Want to use the iPad? Press the big obvious button. Want to use the Samsung? Hold on, where's the button? Which way am I holding it? Let me check the edges. Wrong edge. Flip it upside down, then look there. Ok, found it. Now it's on.This tablet has widgets. You can move stuff around. It shows the weather on the home screen! Cool, except: This kills battery life. It takes time to organize all this fluff. Once organized, no one else can find anything on your tablet. With an iPad, everything is there. No fluff. Want the weather, click the weather app. No need to install a weather widget. Hand the iPad to someone, they immediately know how to use it.Just buy an iPad. You can get a like-new refurbished iPad for a few bucks more. Buying this instead would be like buying a Ford when you could have had a Mercedes for almost the same price.

For one day, I'll need excel to process some work spreadsheets and reports while I'm on vacation.  So I actually bought the tablet to test it out.It works a lot like my samsung galaxy nexus phone, which I love.  the speed, graphics, netflix, angry birds, chrome surfing on the internet--all beautiful.  i love that i can speak at the tablet, and it will take my words and do a search on it. that's something i often wish my laptop would catch on to.  just a matter of time, right?as for spreadsheets, there is an application called Polaris office. with much effort, i figured out how to paste raw data from an internet page (text and numbers) to polaris spreadsheets.  i saw that a bluetooth keyboard and mouse might be helpful for moving numbers/data around.  however, without the official microsoft excel software i am used to, there a few functions that i just couldn't get to work.  one was \"text to columns\" data parsing, which i needed to paste the data i got off the internet onto a spreadsheet, with numbers falling into different columns.  and i also could not convert data, once in the spreadsheet, into pivot tables (a sort of database function).  i should have known, as this is a more advanced excel function.  and i'm sure microsoft is not going to be doing any favors for android/google.if you're contemplating using the tablet for intermediate excel or spreadsheets, this is not a good laptop replacement . . . yet.i hope this helps someone else wondering a similar question.  otherwise, i still gave the tablet 4 stars.  it is quite impressive and much faster than my kindle fire (does not get stuck one bit).  you can even expand the memory with a micro sdhc card--and those are getting pretty cheap and fast now.  for me, there didn't seem to be a ton of bloatware on the tablet, and if there was, i could remove things very easily using their operating system (drag to trash).  my only disappointment for the fun software is not being able to find a new yorker magazine application for samsung tablets yet.  on my kindle fire, it makes the new yorker a thousand times better to read. so that would have knocked my kindle fire out of usage.", "Title": "Not a good replacement if you need intermediate spreadsheets (like excel)", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Daniel Kalip", "ReviewID": "R1JVBKHTXJE7H5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not so good. lagging is the biggest problem.

This week the screen suddenly started flickering and flashing bright colors... yellow and pink. Every time I touched the screen or tried to scroll it would just go crazy flashing so badly I had to close my eyes.  I'm thinking anyone prone to seizures should beware!  I couldn't get it to stop.  Very disappointing!  It's going back tomorrow.  :(I have to say that even before this screen problem, I was not all that impressed with this tablet.  It's my first so I have nothing to compare it to, but I somehow expected more.  It's not overly fast and scrolling isn't all that smooth.  It's kind of jumpy when you're trying to zoom in or out.  Seems like it overcompensates a lot.  It also seemed to suddenly jump to another page or app when I don't think I even touched on them, but I suppose maybe I accidentally touched a spot on the edge of the screen or something and didn't realize it?I'd have to say that I found this tablet a generally frustrating experience.Update 12/8/12:I purchased an Asus transformer tf300t and so far it has been amazing.  Definitely outperforms the Tab 2.  It is very fast and scrolling and zooming are very smooth.  So far no problems.Another update 8/04/13:  I just realized I never came back to update this with my end result.  I ended up returning the problematic Asus also and bought an ipad 2.  My son is an Apple guy but I kept refusing to listen to him when he kept telling me to just buy an ipad or to at least go to a store and play with a floor model and see the difference. Well i finally did.... and much as I hated to admit it HE WAS RIGHT.  Ok, I said it.  Ugh.  The best way to explain it is It simply WORKS.  Smooth as can be and a delight to use. The quality is amazing.  I also love the shape of it.  It's not as narrow as the other pads making it much nicer to view online content.  So there you have it.

Part of my decision to buying this tablet is based on what I read in those online reviews and the other part is because of the fact that I already have all my online contents in Google friendly platforms and this tablet being Android OS I can keep all my contents synced up across all my devices. I could without a sweat (within 2 minutes after I unpacked the product) get this device to sync up with my other device contents - awesome. Then downloaded couple of my apps, visited a few of my favorite websites, played a few videos and movies from Netflix and other sites. That is when I noticed how poor the resolution is on this tab, especially the text during the film credits practically not readable. I am comparing the resolution of the same film credits on my 1440x800 Mac screen, Samsung 1280x800 - it is night and day. For discerning eyes, you could easily notice the poor video quality also. I must say the text of eBooks have good resolution though.Having used iPad, lack of zooming, pinching, gestures etc, makes this tab seem less user-friendly and non-responsive. I feel the touch screen is less responsive sometimes, I need to touch harder to launch apps or sometimes I need to go back screen and come back to the current screen to launch an app - weird - I am thinking the screen may be less sensitive to the finger pressure.  Not very many apps available for this tab to be useful beyond basic functionality.I haven't tested the SD card reader etc. so can't say anything about that feature yet. Some of the reviews I have read, expandable storage capacity of this device via SD cards as the positive feature of this Tab over iPad; so I haven't tested the salient feature of this tab yet. I paid less than $290 for 16GB of storage which is a lot less for a comparable iPad device.

(Hey, it was $50 cheaper there than at Best [oxymoron alert] Buy, and I didn't have somebody trying to stuff an overpriced and probably useless \"Extended Warranty\" up my left nostril, either. Plus I had the tablet in hand for a snowed-in weekend. Which may not have been the case if I'd bought it here.)I figured I'd write something up for myself and for others in my situation, a/k/a spiritual descendents of Ned Ludd. So my comments probably don't apply to the propeller heads out there, as much as I and everyone else rely on them these days. You guys (and girls) doubtless have a far better grasp of the ins and outs of this device than I ever shall, but for all that I can't see that (in this case) my ignorance necessarily invalidates my thoughts.Or, to put it bluntly, \"user experience\" is a subjective and NOT an objective thing. Got it? Some of my thoughts may be unfair, in that Samsung probably has no control over some of what follows, but so what? I bought the tablet hoping do certain things. If I can't get them to do those things, or at any rate not easily, I'm a less than happy user. And I'm gonna honk like an angry Canada Goose interrupted mid-turd drop at your favorite local pond, lake or river. (Doubtless some auditors of this review will think that said metaphor applies to this review as a whole, but such is life.) Contra that, this admitted ignorance is also why I'm marking this review as a \"Work in Process.\" If I figure out how do some of things I'm less than thrilled about, I'll come back and say so. Not sure if I'll be able to edit the rating, but I'll cross that bridge when and if I come to it.Anyway, enough bloviating.PLUSES:+ It is not Apple. I've had it with Kupertino Krap, and will never again drink any Kupertino Kool-Aid.+ The YouTube screen-tap issue cited by Xin Ning in their review seems to have gone away, at least for me. (The artist selection screen looks different, though, so possibly they were talking about going in via a channel and not a plain old search? Dunno, since I've never done that and am not certain how to.)+ Very sharp looking screen.+ The camera and video features seems above average to excellent from where I'm sitting. Not sure what is expected in that department, but I'm more than happy with what I've got+ The integration with Gmail and Google Drive. Much easier than I expected.+ Kindle and Overdrive - I've read library e-books via both. Both have worked flawlessly thus far.+ Did I mention it is NOT Apple?MINUSES:- The Flash thing, Part I: Why exactly should I install something on the device that the Adobe website itself says:****Below is a list of device and OS combinations that are certified for running Adobe Flash Player. Installing Flash Player on an uncertified device may result in unexpected behavior and can potentially destabilize your device.Please note: Flash Player will not be certified for any device OS beyond Android 4.0.x.****Great. Frickin' great. So I put something on the device that can potentially wreck it, and also invalidate whatever warranty might otherwise be in place. And that's if I can figure out which iteration of Flash I'm supposed to be installing. This is like one of the Kupertino Kool-Aid drinkers claiming that their [overpriced and equipped with training wheels whatever] is just wonderful NOW that they've done a Jailbreak on it.- The Flash thing, Part II: I realize Amazon is in this business to make money. I get that. I also get that the main reason I signed up for Amazon Prime had nothing to do with the video service. It is still a flaming hemorrhoid that there's no app, free or paid, that will run on anything anything but an I-Pad or a Kindle. In sum: Very, very lame, Mr. B. And you'll not be getting any rentals or purchases at $2.99 a pop from me, either. At least at present.- The Flash thing, Part III: (OCD a bit? Well, maybe.) I tried jinkying around with various browsers: FF, Chrome, and Samsung's default, and none of them would run Amazon's streaming service. I've not yet tried the MX Player or Dolphin, so possibly one of them will work. My point here being is not that I might or might not get it to work ultimately, but that I'm irritated that I have to jump through all these hoops in the HOPE I'll get it to run. Seems like way too much work to finally get to watch Operation: Nazi Zombie or some other uplifting fare in bed at night.- The sound - The speakers sound tinny to my ears. A bit better with headphones, but the problem with them is that they don't seem loud enough. (Whether or not that is the result of a misspent youth of one too many Judas Priest concerts, well, I'll leave that as an open question.) Even via the auxiliary jack in my car, with the bass all the way up and the treble reduced I can't say I'm thrilled. Though it gives the best sound I've yet gotten from the Tab 2.- Samsung's App Store - The games section is a HUGE bait & switch operation. \"Free\" typically means free for two levels and then you either have to buy something, join a dating service (WTF is THAT about?) or apply for a credit card. Samsung is doubtless relying on outside vendors here, but since it is at their site I consider this a completely fair criticism. They could and should do a better job policing what is, after all, their own playpen.JURY STILL OUT? Samsung's App Store - Other than the games, that is. I've d/l'd a few apps, some I like, some I'm annoyed with or about. Or have already deleted.? Other App Stores - I d/l'd a supposedly free wallpaper from Amazon's Android App store last week. It looked like it downloaded, claimed it downloaded, but wound up nowhere I could see on the device. Since I haven't gotten buried with ads for Russian mail order brides (yet), I'm assuming this was either a failed download or something otherwise benign. At least I hope so.? Device Documentation - I know I need to do a bit more reading in this area, but I'm thinking this device is still not all that inuitive to use? Device Layout - If I had nickel for every time I've shut off the screen while meaning to turn adjust the volume, well, I'd probably have about $5.00. Maybe I'm the only fool on the planet who does such a thing on a regular basis, and maybe I'll get used to it. Still a bit too early for me to say.TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONDevice is okay. Nice, but no \"wow\" factor at all. It does some things well to very well, but it also has its share of quirks and liabilities. I'm certainly not going to be shifting back to Kupertino Kool-Aid (shudders). But am I going to be wondering if I overpaid for this device compared to some other Android OS tablets out there?

Since you can buy a used old generation iPad for the same price as a new Galaxy Tab 2, there is no real reason to buy the later unless you love the Android environment (which sort of sucks) or you are a developer or there is a certain app that is not available at the Apple store.Note: Ignore the 5 star reviews, they are all fake.
