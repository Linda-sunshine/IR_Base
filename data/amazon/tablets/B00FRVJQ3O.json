Two weeks after receiving it the charging dock came loose and wouldn't charge anymore. Then I sent it back for a replacement, FINALLY got a new one almost a month later and after being on it for 20 minutes it shut itself down and won't reboot. They won't give me my money back because it's been more than 30 days-they want me to send it back for repair. Ridiculous. I will never buy anything from this company again.", "Title": "Negative stars weren't an option but one star is too generous of a rating", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "Tuesday Aziz", "ReviewID": "R2D1ME6WGL2IZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased these for my nieces and nephews.
