Anyway, I decided I would go shopping for a tablet PC that would be good enough to satisfy me until I have enough money saved up to get an iPad, and this tablet is just... \"Truly Amazing!\" I wanted it fast, so I requested the \"One day shipping.\" and of course it came very quickly. I ordred it on Sunday the 19th, and it arrived Tuesday the 21st, it was $20 extra, but totally worth it. Anyway, it came packaged in a VERY nice box with ANDROID printed all over it. They even included a free screen protector! After I opened it up, it was fully charged and ready to go. And my first impression was that the tablet was absolutely stunning. It is fast, vibrant, up-to-date, and has surprisingly loud speakers! I cannot believe this device only cost me $100, and it does such wonderful things! It's equipted with Android 4.0.4, and is very speedy. It has a good weight to it, and it looks sturdy. I do have to say that RARELY it can slow down a little bit, but 95% of the time, it is very smooth and crisp. I will also say that the screen isn't MARVELOUS, but I would like to write a note to anyone scared of a \"Cloudy Screen\" ...Please, read EVERYTHING about the tablet before purchasing it.  The screen resolution CLEARLY LISTS that it's 800X480 pixels, what did you expect, an iPad Retina Display? haha, It's $100 , it certainly will NOT be the best display you have ever seen, so don't scare people away by saying \"Dull screen!\" It honestly isn't that bad, it's just fine! Thank you(:Anyway, this tablet is absolutely fantastic! It has a very fast processer, and when you watch movies and such on it, it's a very nice mini T.V.! I cannot get over how fantastic this buy was! I absolutely LOVE this tablet, I already have 10 apps, 150 songs, and 10 notes on it, and it runs VERY smoothly. It downloads apps and songs EVEN faster than my Galaxy phone! And my phone is very fast! The webcam isn't the greatest though, but it's okay and still get's the job done! After a full month of searching for a tablet to get... I thought this one was it, and for a hundred dollars, this thing is brilliant! GET THIS ONE! And plus, the screen is FINE! And VERY responsive! You will LOVE this tablet if you buy it! This ones a keeper! I really hope my review helped some of you \"Tablet Searchers\" out there. In all, this tablet is nicely sized at 7\", very fast, very responsive, and... Just awesome! Deffinately get this one, you won't regret it!(Ignore any negative comments about the \"Cloudy Screen,\" because it's NOT cloudy. You can definitely see pixels on the screen, but nothing to complain about!)-Thanks for veiwing!:D", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "I bought the 4gb version of this tablet and never got to rate it", "Author": "Ray P.

This thing does everything i want it to. Very responsive screen and very nice video playback. Youtube seems to load and run faster than my home computer. Again i have the 4gb version but I would think the 8gb is much better. I added a 32GB flash card and loaded 1200 songs on it. The sound quality is amazing! The camera sucks so go buy yourself a good camera ;) I would recomend this pad. Its my first one and I have been using it for over a month with zero issues. Battery life is about 3-4 hours. All android games seem to work fine and i have not loaded one that does not work. Its so cool to have a nice hand held computer and learn to use android. I hope the US can come out with a good line of these. I would really like to buy USA made!", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't beat the price", "Author": "Glenn L.

I wanted to do some comparisons between my tablet and her ipad:1) Download Speed: My tablet was a little faster than her ipad.2) Bootup & Shutdown Speed: The ipad was faster to bootup but the tablet was faster to shutdown3) Internet Speed: The tablet was much faster than the ipad as far as pulling up websites.  Oh, and yes we both were connected to my network.Overall:I am very pleased with my purchase.The touchscreen is very nice.  The size is perfect.  My only complaint is the owners manual, not very technically infofmative.Would like to purchase a TF/MINI SDCard but not sure what the max size this can take.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic buy!!", "Author": "D.A..", "ReviewID": "R26U0E3TVMSRAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After countless hours of research, I decided on this tablet. I ordered 2 of the Tursion 7\", 4.0 Android 8GB tablets. One for myself, and one for my 16 yr old daughter to use at school. I had originally started looking at Kindles. I like to read and thought those would be great, but after researching I discovered I could get a whole lot more for a whole lot less. Why get just an ereader when you can have that AND the apps AND the net? Exactly. The tablets arrived one day ahead of schedule, which was great. The manufacture packaging was simple, but secure. The actual shipping packaging, not so great. The box had a rip in it, and one side looked very similar to an accordion. Out of the box, this tablet is very sturdy. It doesn't have a generic feel to it at all. The buttons are nice, great screen, and an overall feel of a more expensive tablet. Friends have even commented on how they would like to have one after seeing how nice mine is. The tablet comes with a wall charger, USB plug, and a screen protector! That was a nice bonus! The manual however, is quite worthless. My advice on that is to just play with the tablet, I did and was able to figure everything out fairly quickly. I also ordered 2 Sandisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC 16GB cards for added storage. Both work amazing! I wasn't sure which card to order, given the SD vs SDHC, as not too many reviews were helpful on this & I am new to the tablet world. However, it says right on the card packaging \"Ideal for Android smartphones and tablets\", so I chose this one, and it works perfect! The tablet recognized the card right away. After plugging the tablet in to my home computer via the included USB, I was able to transfer photos & music with ease. Now, some of the reviews I read said they had trouble connecting to Wifi... Not the case for me. As soon as I turned the Wifi on, it recognized 4 different Wifi connections for my location, and I was sitting outside of a friend's house. One of those connections was hers. I typed in her password and I was connected, with a great signal too! I went to the Play Store, and made a new account, and downloaded SEVERAL apps. They all work great! Then I browsed the web, no trouble there either. Very responsive tablet. I bought a stylus pen to help with clicking on the small stuff as my fingertips seem just a tad too big for some stuff. Some of the other reviews also said that the screen was \"cloudy\", it's not. This isn't an Ipad, but it still has a great screen. Don't let a few bad reviews keep you from purchasing this tablet. The speakers are also pretty great, so I don't know why a few people were complaining about that either. I think some people just have to find something to complain about. My 16 yr old loves this tablet! She's a tech junkie, so if she's impressed, it's pretty great! I haven't had any lagging problems, or not responding issues either. Everything downloads just fine. Now, I've only had this tablet for 2 days, and no issues so far. I will update if anything should arise. But my overall opinion would be if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet with all the bells and whistles, this is the one. It does practically everything an Ipad does, and at a fraction of the cost. I give it 5 stars! It's pretty fantastic! Buy it, you'll love it!!***Update*** After using this tablet for almost 2 weeks, I wanted to add that the Kindle app is FANTASTIC!! There are TONS of free Kindle books on Amazon too! The battery has around 3-4 hours of charge, not bad. There is only one disappointment so far, and it's not with the tablet... the official Netflix app for Android has been updated and the updated app doesn't work. It's not the tablet, it's the app. When the app is repaired, Netflix should work without a hitch. Everyone is having the same issue, but I really wanted to stress that it's not the tablet. Crackle works just fine. I have watched full movies on the tablet through Crackle without any problems.

Basically a full featured iPad at 1/5 the price. No notable flaws; allows me to read books on the go, listen to music and browse the internet at high speeds.

Not bad at all", "Author": "Juan Manuel Garcia \"Juanma\"", "ReviewID": "R3KBUEHVYO9AW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the 4Gb version of the Tursion tablet and have been using it for around three to four weeks now, everybody at home (wife and kids) believe that this is cool for the price (well, mostly me since iPaid...)  There are a bunch of other reviews, but I will just highlight what I like the best and what I don't like of this small, but not bad at all 7\" tablet, keep in mind this is a budget tablet good for WiFi navigation, e-reading, accessing social networks, playing and maybe very casual MS office files editing.Likes:+ Good, responsive capacitive screen+ Charging time around 4 hrs+ Android system, 4.0.4 version, menus are pretty intuitive+ Micro SD port (up to 32 Gb)+ Sound level from the speaker is decent, includes headphone output and a physical button to increase/decrease volume+ Screen rotation works pretty good+ Able to download apps and games from Google Play channel from scratchDislikes:- No HDMI output (I know it is too much to ask for the price range, but the technical information stated it included one)- Only 1 mini USB port- Only 1 camera (front)- No SIM card port- Instructive is pretty much uselessAt the beginning I had problems to link to my WiFi router and since I read some complaints on this from other reviewers I thought I had received a bad unit... but after searching the web I found some comments related to using all caps for the SSID and password, changed my password to CAPS (I *think* it was originally configured that way, duh!) and voila!The tablet came in a box labeled \"Android\" all over it, included the battery charger and 1 std USB to mini-USB cable. Included the  screen protector from the factory (disposable), but no extra screen protector. I am still looking for a protective case that fits this tablet.*** EDIT 11/28/12 : Finally found a case that fit this tablet almost perfect. The Tursion tablet has almost the same dimensions - but not the connectors layout, beware - as the Kindle Fire 7, and since this case has openings on all the sides (all connectors remain clear and it does not cover the camera), it fit very good: YooMee Black Amazon Kindle Fire 7 Inch Android Tablet Leather Case Cover Folio with Multi-Angle Stand and Hand Strap (Black)(NOT Compatible with Fire HD)Also got a screen protector (includes 2) that fit very good (even the camera cut out fit quite right): eForCity Transparent Clear LCD Screen Protector Film for HTC Flyer (Twin Pack)...More or less 10 bucks for both: what a steal... hope this helps.All in all, if you don't want to spend +250 on a 7\" tablet, this is a very good option, with the basic features at a great price tag... Enjoy!*** EDIT: 11/12: Tablet still working fine, however after falling from the bed (it was inside its case, from about 2 feet tall) it showed a message telling that it needed to be reset... apps installed were lost and a couple of files that were downloaded, other than that, it seems to be working still fine. The main point here is: be gentle with it, keep in mind it is kind of cheap solution, I think it is not designed to survive even light abuse.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbelieveable tablet for the price", "Author": "garyznola", "ReviewID": "R2X5807YF62OJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have orderd nine, 7\" tablets of various makes (Ployer, Momo, Ainol, Novo, All Winner, and even a refurbished Acer Iconia A100) ranging from $90-$150 to give as gifts.  All were good tablets in there own way and work just fine and exceeded my expectations.  I just wish I would have discovered these tablets first.  I was only able to order 3 of these as they were the last 3 of the nine.  Not only was the price much lower than the other slightly more expensive tablets but these tablets were able to accept all the apps that I wanted to preload to each.  For example these tablets are able to install both yahoo messenger and the video plugin while the others were not.  Some of the more expensive tablets would not allow the install of a couple of the Angry Bird apps while this tablet loaded all of them.  I own an iPad 2 and I am tempted to get one of these myself.  For $80 I just might. Yes, it isn't as responsive and not up to par on the quality of a iPad 2 but what you would get for $80 vice $800 you can't go wrong with this tablet.

I did a very thorough review of tablets to find this one as I did not want something expensive (iPad), fragile (iPod Touch), or overly-proprietary (Kindle, Nook, Nexus).  While it does take some time to learn how to navigate the screens and actions (it is NOT as intuitive as an iPad), it is PERFECT for my eight year old. I have loaded movies and music on the SD Card--everything plays fine, no problem. I have downloaded content from Google Play (Angry Birds, Turbo Grannies, Wreck-it-Ralph, Kindle, Nook, etc.)--all apps work, no problem. Now, the speaker is certainly not great; but for better sound, use headphones. Also, the WiFi antenna range is weak, at best; but, I don't not plan on having my son accessing the Internet in his bedroom any time soon. The touchscreen is not great, but I am using a screen protector. Additionally, there's not a perfect case that matches the buttons and jacks for this tablet. I just purchased an generic folding cover that is adequate. Finally, on the downside, the charger is VERY unique to this tablet and cannot be misplaced or easily replaced--so keep it close.I have NOT used the tablet for streaming movies (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon), so I cannot comment on that function. But, as I mentioned, the wireless range is minimal, at best. So I would imagine that to get good streaming quality, you would have to use the tablet in the same room as your wireless router. I have also NOT used the HDMI connection.Overall, for my son, this is a great product. I would definitely recommend it to folks wanting to purchasing a tablet for their young kids, but not wanting to spend a fortune.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mindblowing!", "Author": "Wolfyforever", "ReviewID": "R1KT6GOSQ7KXDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For eighty bucks this is a fantastic tablet.

Price", "Author": "A. Stapleton", "ReviewID": "R3J9TAZB9U6UBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Tursion 4GB tablet with Android 4.0.4 on it for more than 8 months and have had little trouble with it.  Has all the features listed except for the HDMI output (which I already knew it wouldn't have, not for its price).  All the features is does have work fairly well for a bargain tablet:Pros1) Capacitive screen is responsive and fairly fast.2)  Screen output is clear and sharp, good enough for someone who wears reading lenses to happily watch TV programming and movies on it.3)  Mini-USB connection transfers reasonably fast data or varying sizes and types.4)  SD card slot (something a lot of name brand manufacturers STILL won't put in their tablets!) works like a charm.  Got a generic 32GB SD card in it that works beautifully.5)  Audio is very good, but I haven't found a case for it yet that doesn't muffle it a bit because the speaker is on the back.  Even with it in a case, audio is still quite snazzy.  It's my pr6)  Headphone jack is solid and works nicely with anything I plug into it.7)  The 3 touch buttons on one side (depending on its orientation) on the front work exactly as designed (standard Android options).8)  Auto-orientation is quick and works well for Android and all apps designed to recognize it.9)  Battery life runs 8-10 hours without WIFI engaged.10). One last detail: it's 3G capable according to the onbard device listing.It's not as fast as a laptop or desktop (of course not!), nor as fast and powerful as an iPad or other high-end tablet (of course not!), and I'm very satisfied with using it to read books, watch movies, listen to music, occasionally check email and visit the rare website with it.  Do not expect full-sized performance from any tablet, including this one.Cons:1)  Battery life only 4-5 hours with WIFI engaged.  Install anything graphic intensive (like Live Wallpaper, movies and/or other eye candy) and it will cut life down by 1/3 or so.2)  The 1.3MP camera is pretty bad, even for that range.  Either Android handles it badly or the hardware simply sucks.  Not a big deal for me, I have an Android phone I depend on for pictures and video.3)  I've had the occasional odd issue where it won't come back out of screen shut-off, but that's been solved by holding down the power button until it forces a shut down and then powering it back up - same thing I do with full-sized laptops and desktops when they're being flaky (don't let anyone fool you otherwise - ALL computers, tablets to desktops and everything in between flakes like this now and then).4)  Mini-USB and dedicated power connections are loose and tend to fall out if not watched.  Could use some minor engineering improvements.5)  Can't find any linking information online to Tursion or any company that supports these units (spec information on tablet says it's a model F721).  Basically, it means that if you want tech support or to upgrade Android on it, you're out of luck as Tursion is most likely a subsidiary of a larger Chinese manufacturer who doesn't support the unit after distribution.

I read some reviews mentioning a cloudy screen, but I don't see any problems with it.  It's not HD but  it's still fine.  It found my internet connection fast, loaded youtube vids quickly, so no complaints there.  I had searched for a lower end tablet for a couple of days (just couldn't justify spending hundreds on something I didn't really need) and finally decided to listen to the reviews and decided on this one.Overall, I got a lot more than I expected an am happy with my purchase, barring any unforssen issues arising of course.(I will update my review should any issues arise)EDITOk, so I've had this tablet for a bit now and, wow, still impressed!  My cat has a nasty habit of getting on the table and knocking everything to the floor and he couldn't resist when he saw this tablet laying there.  The cover came off, the button covers went flying and there i sat horrified!  Anyways, I popped everything back together and it didn't miss a beat.

Now on to a realistic review after 4 days of use.Pros:1.  This little tablet is impressively fast.  It is running at an average of 1.2 GHZ and it may actually go to 1.5 GHZ if an appliation demands it.  I've played a couple of games that seem pretty intensive for a tablet and it runs smoothly.2.  It connected to my home network with absoluely zero problems and it connected at 150 Mb/second.  Also connected at the network where I work at the same speed.  What's with the negative comments about WIFI on this thing?  I think the people writing the negative reviews should probably steer clear of computers in general.3.  Wifi signals on this thing show higher than both my smart phone and  my laptop computer, so it's got a great wifi card.4.  Video looks great on this thing, especially if you rip an HD DVD.  Beautiful. No, not an \"eyebright\" screen, but to my eyes, movies look fantastic.5.  It was $85.99!  I got this tablet, a keyboard/case (haven't received it yet) and a 16gb memory card for something like $102.00!Note:  The micro SD slot works fine and this tablet recognizes the card just fine - BUT you have to push that sucker all the way in!  The reviews stating that \"it won't recognize the SD card\" are most definitely from people that aren't used to the little spring-loaded slots and don't realize that if the card is inserted properly, it is FLUSH - not sticking out at all.Amazon AppStore works great on this thing, as well as the Kindle program for Android.  I've downloaded 2 games and 7 books and they all work/look fantastic.Cons?:I had one issue where the battery meter read 26% and the thing would shut off suddenly (out of power).  I charged it back up and the same thing happened.  I downloaded a program called Battery Calibration from Google Play and followed the instructions - still had a problem, so I ran the thing completely dead again and when I plugged the charger in and got it charged enough to boot again, the battery meter properly read 3% charged instead of 26%.  I also downloaded Battery Doctor so that I could perform full-cycle charges occasionally to extend the life of the battery. Anyway, now when my meter reads 20% or so, it really is at 20%.  Not sure exactly how this was cured, but I listed the steps I took for the hell of it.  This is similar to \"bump-charging\" a cell phone to get it to a \"true\" 100% charge.This still won't connect to my work VPN. Not the fault of the tablet, but Cisco Anyconnect for Android just doesn't work properly - so I will have to lug my laptop on business trips if I want to connect up to my work's network.  Not much of a con, but an FYI.  I don't understand how Cisco can release their own tablet that runs Android, but still not have fixed their program to work with higher-security VPNs.  So I guess the only \"con\" is that this isn't a Windows tablet.  :-)Now, I understand this in't the most technically savvy review on the planet, but I can honestly say that most of the people complaining about the WiFi and the SD card just don't know what they are talking about.  There was one review stating that \"it doesn't really have a USB port!\"  I can assure  you that it does (a MINI-USB port).  Adapters are cheap if  you require standard-sized USB for some gigantic keyboard...So far, I'm a very satisfied customer.  I'll update if the thing takes a crap on me (like I thought it did during the battery issue).  As for now, I have no problem at all recommending this, especially for a Sub-$90.00 price.***P.S.:  The screen ISN'T scratched!  It comes with a very think plastic screen protector that is very hard to see, but it's there!  I had the same first reaction as many people who think it came scratched and sent it back, but had the sense to look a bit closer and see that it is just a screen protector (with 2 VERY thin pieces of tape that say right on them \"please remove before using application.\"11/20/2012 update:  The strange battery issue is still there.  I'll be watching a video or surfing the internet (Wifi connection is still superb, by the way), and at 26%, it will shut off like a plug was pulled.

The first two worked smoothly once they buffered, which wasn't terribly long. The touch screen was decently responsive, I didn't have any significant issues, just occasionally having to try and retype something. The Android is a real android OS and all the games and other apps we downloaded from Google Play were compatible with the tablet. We never had any trouble connecting to WiFi. She carried it with us everywhere so we connected to probably 50 different hotspots over the tablets life. There was no front facing camera and the rear facing one was quite low MP. Was never an issue, I have a camera. The speakers were a little tinny, but not very loud. She used headphones and the sound was fine.

The device itself is very sleek and it powered up immediately, with a nominal charge on the battery.  As I installed apps and played with the settings, I went to adjust the brightness and the screen went dark.  Nothing I could do could bring the screen back. After searching on the internet, I discovered that this was described as a \"voltage problem\" and that flashing the device with firmware update should fix it.  This, however, did not work for me.David at Value Max was polite and seemed concerned, but had little-to-no knowledge about the device.  He promised a return call after talking to the person in charge of QC, but three days later I have still not heard from him and when I went to call him back the second day I got a busy signal.  I began to fuss around with the buttons and after pressing and holding both the volume up button and the power button, the screen came to live in some sort of programming/recovery mode.  I deleted the cache and then selected factory reset.  The device booted up with no trouble and the screen was normal again.  I had to reinstall all of the apps, but my e-books and other content were still on the device. I am not sure if this brightness thing is a common problem or if it affects my tablet in particular.Since the reboot, I have had no trouble at all.  I purchased this tablet to use as a e-reader for books and graphic novels and it does the job amazingly.  The Netflix app worked, but it was a little slow.  Also, the  video resolution on the screen was less than ideal. When I uploaded an HD movie to the device, it played and looked fine.  Not iPad clarity, but good enough.  I don't keep many apps open on the device at once and, especially with the Wifi turned off, the battery lasts.  Three hours of reading reduced it by about a third.  After the screen had been off for a few hours, the battery hadn't diminished any further.It's not very sturdy. I think one good drop would wreck it, but for $100 it is a great device.  It works well for reading books or e-mail.  I don't plan to use it for video, but it performed well when I was trying it out with the Netflix App, YouTube app, and movies on the hard drive.  All in all, I am pleased with it thus far.UPDATE: Device eventually went tits-up right after Christmas.

I will give the company props for running what seemed to be stock ICS without any additional odd \"features\" like some of the other cheap Android manufacturers (here's looking at you LG!) but he hardware was absolutely atrocious in quality.  The battery would completely die at anywhere from 10-30%; no warning, so if you were in the middle of say, writing your thesis on Microbiology with Kingsoft Office, you would totally lose all of your work.Additionally, the screen seemed very cheap and flimsy, sometimes when holding the back of the tablet with a firm grip, I would notice my finger made a mark on the screen, which sometimes the tablet's interface recognized as a tap and would initiate some other part of a program.  Very annoying. Occasionally buttons seemed to want to press themselves and do very strange things.  No idea why, but I'm sure it had something to do with the lovely quality of that screen.There was also an odd rattle inside the tablet, never did figure out what was just hanging loose in there; but needless to say, I returned it and spent the extra $100 and got a Nexus 7.

I HAD DECIDED THAT I WOULD TRY THE DEVICE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION BEFORE GIVING IT TO MY GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS. ONE OF THE REVIEWERS SAID THAT HIS DEVICE CAME FULLY CHARGED UT OF THE BOX. THIS ONE DID NOT. THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID A FULL CHARGE TAKES ABOUT SIX HOURS. THIS ONE WAS FULLY CHARGED AFTER TWO HOURS. THE SCREEN IS CLEAR AND FUNCTIONS WITH SLIGHT TO MODERATE TOUCH AND IS EASY TO READ. DID NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE FONT AND THAT WAS A SURPRISE BECAUSE I USUALLY HAVE TO CHANGE TO FONT ON MY COMPUTER AND MY KINDLE SINCE I WEAR GLASSES. IT IS LIGHT ANS EASY TO HANDLE. IT LOOKS LIKE I SET THE TIME AND DATE WITH EASE. COMES WITH SOME APPS AND I DID NOT TRY TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. WILL LEAVE THAT TO GRANDSON. SOUND APPEARS TO BE GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE.
