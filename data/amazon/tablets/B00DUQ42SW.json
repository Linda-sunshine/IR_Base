I had a question, when the tablet first arrived and emailed the Tuvva support team. They got back to me right away and answered my question, clearly and concisely. The only negative so far is that the charger cord did not fit securely into the device and would fall out when charging. I emailed Tuvva team once again and they said they'd send out a replacement right away. Within 4 days I had a new one and it works fine. So far a great value overall. This is a Christmas present, and I believe it will be a hit.", "Title": "Tuvva 7\" BuddiTab review", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "jane m tipton", "ReviewID": "R328Y1X5DW3RQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My grandson loves this, sad to say though his mother says he is on it ALL the time !

It's inexpensive and if it lasts 2 years I would be happy. The screen quality is very poor however and if you do not look directly at it you cannot see the image. The camera on it only faces \"IN\" so only selfies can be taken BUT the camera is unusable and takes terrible pictures. They should not even include this feature on the device it is that bad. For what we bought it for it does the job but if you intend to use it for reading or video watching do not buy this item. I actually had thought of buying their 10\" device for $159 but definitely would not even consider it after seeing the quality of the 7\". I will stick with Samsung for my devices.", "Title": "You get what you pay for!", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lisa Bosten", "ReviewID": "R1P8UIZ9MKGVTL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first I had problems connecting to my internet but once I did it has brought joy to my 7year old niece.", "Title": "problems at first", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "kris", "ReviewID": "RF2OZWWY5MG77", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The tablet takes to long to charge.
