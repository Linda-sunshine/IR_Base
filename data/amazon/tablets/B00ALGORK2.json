You definitely get what you pay for. It has android 4.0 but it lags. The touchscreen is not as responsive. The USB port does not function, defeating the purpose for which I purchased the tablet.  My prepaid phone works better than this tablet.  Save up your money and get a Samsung tab because you will be disappointed with this item.", "Title": "Not worth the money", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.99", "ProductID": "B00ALGORK2", "Features": "Cellular Band - Android Tablet - Wi-Fi Only", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417kx3FSZML._SY300_.jpg", "Name": "BLU Touch Book 7.0 Lite P50 Tablet PC with Android 4.0 OS, Multi-Touchscreen, MP3/MP4 Player, Wi-Fi and microSD Slot - White"}}
