{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2FR1JSO0K7H8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked one of these up just to try a larger screen than my 7 inch android tab. I am very pleased with this tablet. Plenty of room for apps, speed seems great compared to my little tablet and my android phone. It feels good in my hand/hands even when using it as an e-reader at night. Wifi range is fine..have had no issues connecting, and the on board lan jack is very convenient since a hard-wired lan is much faster than wifi. (I happen to keep an extra cable in my living room).The only reason I was going to ding a star is I did feel the battery life (about three hours in full use) was not the greatest, but then again it is one fourth the price of an IPAD... I have had two opportunities to use this side by side with an IPAD and frankly the differences were negligible in terms of surfing speed, loading apps, etc. Obviously an IPAD screen has higher resolution and a slightly better touch response, but the Irulu is still easy to read, very bright and videos look great. I enjoy typing on the 10 inch much more than the 7.I did order a case on EBAY that is kind of a flat leather folio case, as it did not come with one, and I like the folio cases better than the zipper cases, especially when using the tablet as an ebook at night.One issue that came up was the wifi sometimes would not come back on after sleeping. A free app called \"wifi-lock\" corrected this immediately so that was resolved. It also contributes to saving battery life. I also found, via experimentation, that a cheap USB wifi device works well in this tablet, and has a larger range than the on board. Did not have to run an app or install any software...ICS 4 just defaulted to the usb wifi...very cool!  However, I don't use the usb device since the on board has been just fine. Nice to have as a backup, though.Overall, I highly recommend this tablet; it had no hardware issues at all, runs great, and its nice having the lan jack feature and two usb ports. Lastly the stereo speakers are pretty nice.Now, one of the ports does not respond to USB 2 cables but does read thumb drives, but I am told that this is because it is an exclusive USB 3 port that will allow me to charge via USB. Once I check that out I will post back.I should also mention that I dropped this tablet on a hard tile floor from about 5 feet, such that the binding of the front screen popped out, yet the tablet still worked perfectly and the binding just popped back into place. So I would say this is also a very sturdy device.addendum 11/19/12: Still working great, but I discovered some nice apps that let you send files wirelessly from your pc to the tablet..pretty amazing..your tablet's folders will appear on your pc desk top and you can just drag files into them. Just activate the app and set your tablet down anywhere, and you can move files, no cables at all. Only about 2 bucks for the pro versions that have no size limits.Addendum: some people have asked about a case. This is a 10.2 inch tablet, so just search Ebay for \"android 10.2 tablet case\" and you will find them. They run about 10 bucks with free shipping.Addendum 2/6/13: Tablet still working fine, no issues.Adedendum 8/30/13: still working, no issues.", "Title": "Great value for the price", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "Nelmun", "ReviewID": "RB7LLGLRUPAJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the money is a good tablet, good response, nice graphics, nice pictures, can play videos without lagging (netflix, youtube), comes with android 4.0 operating system(ICS), wifi, hdmi, 1gb of ram, multiple languages.

I am a musician and plan on using this mainly to display lead sheets while I perform and to have as a reader for ebooks and audible books.  It looks like it will do both just fine.  The \"English\" instruction manual is another story...I have NO clue to what it says - it makes very little sense, primarily due to the syntax usage from translation from Chinese to English.  The manual is amusing, but not very helpful.The screen type is clear but the operating system takes a little getting use to, but since I am Windows guy, I assume I would have the same problem with an iPad if I tried to use one.  Nothing is instantaneous on this, so if you are use to touching the screen and having something happen, you'll be a little disappointed...there may be an adjustment for screen sensitivity but I haven't had the opportunity to play with that yet.For the price, I can't see how anyone would complain about the tablet. It looks well made and feels sturdy although I don't think I would drop it to test out its durability. It needed to be charged when I received it and it took an hour to do that.  The camera and video work fine and the resolution is pretty impressive.  There are two little speakers on each side of the tablet and I haven't tried them out yet but I assume they won't be mind boggling.The wi-fi work flawlessly and quickly, and the Documents-to-go app installed in about 20 seconds which allowed me to read .docx files and .xls files with no problem.All in all, this puppy is a good value.", "Title": "First impressions", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "cmehta82 \"CKrish\"", "ReviewID": "R17292ERDYTNNU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th tablet, I have Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, Le Pan TC 970 and Coby 7 inch MID. Trust me, this one is way better than other's in terms of performance. No doubt you can not compare Samsung with this peace as this is too cheap thn samsung. But you will get what you are paying for. The tablet's first impression was not that great I thought I made mistake for getting this one in hurry. But eventually I started liking it. I ordered 2 peace, one for my self and the other for my friend.Screen: not good to be used directly through finger, just use it with stylus and you'll feel you are using a very expensive device. The responses with the stylus is too good. Ofcourse you can not play some games as it is not comfortable to play some 3D games using stylus but if you want to use this to watch video, netflix, youtube, it's a great deal.Sound Speaker: The sound is too low, it has 2 stereo speaker but still you will feel that you are watching a TV at volume level 1, the good part is it has a 3.5 female audio jack, you can attach any speaker available in market which has self power can get power from internal USB port with the tablet. I have Coby woofer system with 2 speakers and I am listening the music from last 2-3 hours and enjoying the sound with Coby. Ofcourse it's not the internal speaker, but I am happy that I can attach the external speakers. Charger's Specification : Output 5V, 2000 mA, with a 2.5 mm charging pin.USB: I attach an external mouse on the USB port, but only one port is able to recognize my mouse and then shown me a pointer to click on icons and use keyboard or any other application though external mouse. But mouse has lights and it takes too much battery from the tablet so not worth using mouse. I ordered keyboard case, will get it soon and then will update the review about the USBThis one doesn't have Bluetooth, so can not attach any Bluetooth keyboard or headphone.Wifi, I leave in a small studio apartment so can not comment much on wifi as I am able to watch 720P HD Videos of youtube pretty smoothly. No problemo, but as I told my house is studio and the wifi modem is hardly 10 feet away from my bad.Reading book for like 2-3 hours will be painful for eyes and hands as you have to hold this tablet in certain angle only to read the book and clearly or else you'll have strain in your eyes. So not that great but okay while reading the books.The 1GB ram internal is great value addition to the performance, I am using like 10-11 apps running simultaneously without killing (No Advance Task Killer) and didn't find any issue till now. But sure it boots up slow and shut down is not that quick than le-pan but I guess it's because Le-Pan is on android 2.3 and this is on 4.0 may be because of OS difference.Don't expect too much with front camera. It not great for any video chat, but still is okay to atleast use Skype and talk to your friend on video call. But still the quality is tooo poor. Poor than VGA, was not in my priority list as I hardly talk to friends on skype, that too I use my smart phone (Sony-XPERIA) for that so of no use.HDMI, it has a MINI HDMI port, I didn't tested it yet, had ordered a cable for the same. Will get it soon and then will test and update the review.Screen protector, It already comes with a screen protector, but there are air gaps in mine one so ordered that too separately. Will update about that too soon.Last but not least, this is not a great revolutionary device, but worth buying for the amount you are paying for.UPDATE: 12/01/2012 - I broke my charger. This is just a second day and I broke it. Not happy with that but awesome customer service. I just asked ACCDEPOT to tell me from where I can purchase the charger, they tell me that they are sending me a new charger (shipped this Monday) free of cost.UPDATE: 12/03/2012 - I thought it's because of my mishandling the charger got broken. But it's not the case, the chargers they are sending with the tablet is of really low quality. They did agreed to send me 2 new chargers (as I purchased 2 tablet and both the charger are broken) free of cost. And I can not use the tablet till than. so pretty disappointed with that. Let's hope the new charger's come in good condition. Will update once I receive the charger.UPDATE: 12/12/12 - I am still waiting for the chargers from Accdepot, not sure when it will arrive, mean while I ordered I found a cable on e-bay just search \"New USB2.0 A Male to 2.5mm X 1.0mm Power Charger Cord Cable for TabletPC MP4 GPS\" and you'll find a 1.99$ cable. This one fits the tablet and is really very nice quality better than the one we got originally.UPDATE: 12/12/12 - HDMI Out: I have ordered and HDMI cable from amazon which I got couple of day before, but just tested that today as the charing was out. The tablet is showing the best pictures through my dell M110 projector, even the HD Video with 1080P is also displayed very smoothly. No issues in video, but the issues is with Android programming, once you plug in the HDMI, the audio jack (3.5 Audio Jack) no longer produces sound. So if you want to use it as Home Video Entertainment Player, it wouldn't work with only HDMI cable. I have ordered a splitter for HDMI Out with Audio, I will update for them once I get them.UPDATE: 12/15/12 - Got a new charger finally from Seller today. Amazing and shocking difference on the chargers while comparing with the one sent with tablet. you can just see and decide the difference of the quality and decide that the one with tablet was not at all good. The new charger is really firm at the end of pin, and charging very smoothly, attaching is also very easy as compared to old one, overall now I can give chargers also 5 star.", "Title": "Great peace, worth buying, Chargers 1 Star", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R23UTUZ10ZG92C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I order 2 10 inch iRulu Tablet PCs model AL101(iRulu 10.1 inch Android 4.0 Touchscreen Tablet PC Support MID Google 3G WiFi Network & Bulit-in 1GB DDR3 8GB Nand Flash With RJ-45 Connector for Ethernet/ ADSL).

Moore", "ReviewID": "R3HRR0HFS1S4IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly I'd like to start and say this is an amazing electronic device for the price!  I have had my share of Apples products, Ipad 1 and 2.  and so has my Tech Man and this device is amazing!1. Turning it on its super fast, comes up with their Irulu Logo,  and then android, it opens up to a very nice ICS 4.0.4 OS, the sliding from screen to screen on the home screen is very smooth, the apps work great.  I will say that you will need to callibrate your device to get the most out of it.  Sometimes it is unresponsive but 95% of the time, it is outstanding in the touch responsive part, im quite satisfied with it.2. Battery life on this is GREAT  I was at a half charge when I got it and it lasted me about 2-3 hours more before it got to where I needed to charge the device.  When the brightness is high, your running wifi and several apps like twitter, facebook, and instagram the battery life is about 3 hours.  When I had only an app at a time, or a couple apps, the brightness to half or all the way down,  the battery life sustained atleast 4 hours.  It charges quickly probably typically of what a cellphone would charge (droid Razr user) And it takes about an hour and 30 to charge fully.  from say 75% to 100% only about 30 minuets.3. This device comes already preinstalled with Google's Play Store.  I thought I was going to have to install it myself but with my surprise it already came with it, so I was very satisfied about that. All the apps have downloaded and worked properly there was only 1 app that wasn't compatible with the device and it was a lesser known word search app.4. Games are amazing on this, I love to play the SNES games, and have nearly 100 stored on this tablet via a Micro SD card, it doesn't stick slow down it plays smoothly,especially with games like the Donkey Kong Series, the Zelda Series, even Mario Cart; a continuously running racing game did superb on this product I am trying to see if I can hook up a xbox controller to it to play wired but even without the controller and just the tablet its wonderful! Disclaimer though, make sure you try out a few emulators with the product if it runs slow or choppy it MIGHT be the emulator your using, I had this issue and I switched emulators and everything ran smoothly.5. The WIFI speed honestly depends on your connection, I have a high speed wifi connection which makes pages and various websites load quickly.  I have even tethered my phone to this device wirelessly and still pages loaded fairly quickly, even larger sites like twitter, facebook, JPL, NASA, and MSN, and finally yahoo.  The tablet does great with websites that run a lot of slideshows such as yahoo or MSN.6. Ebooks are amazing on this device!  I have 22 (had 50) books on Kindle that I added myself (Was too broke at the time to buy any so I looked u the titles and added them myself) and the pages and everything on the device are stunning very very well worth the money especially if your someone who liked to read.  Just beware that on this device the kindle reads Mobi files no Epub files.7. The device is durable and sturdy I have already dropped this thing atleast 3 times, and it has held up pretty well!  no cracking no shattering the device is very very well made.8. If you download an app that plays AVI files I was very impressed after dropboxing all my season of Family Guy to my device it ran smoothly, the speakers are pretty alright too though I suggest wearing headphones with this device.9. Did I mention the company was great enough to place on a Screen Protector with the purchase??  So you can save yourself from buying some.10. The only thing I didn't exactly like about this was the fact that I couldn't have a Pattern, Pin, or Lockcode for my device.  But I am sure that I will be able to find a way to lock the device thats the only thing that made me frown for a second or two.Overall this product is outstanding for this price.  My family are full of computer and electronic geeks and after they tested this out, they loved it and will be buying themselves one this christmas.  Go out and buy one, great for kids too!

There is an issue with that.So far I havent encountered an issue with flash videos other than the HD videos not being able to play. If you click on non HD quality for youtube it will play. It also plays flash videos on numerous other sites.I found that in comparison to the iPad, there is a major difference to touch sensitivity. You really have to press on the screen for the touch response to work (especially when navigating websites). However there is a stylus pen which comes with this device and resolves this issue. The pen works far better than your fingertips for some reason.  Calibrate the screen once you turn it on. It made a huge difference for me.Netflix- works fine as long as you have a fast internet connection. Watching TV shows or movies doesn't make the device lag and the quality is OK.Skype - I wished the camera quality was better. The sound is acceptable but you may encounter very low quality video due to the cheap camera this device comes with. If you Skype often and this is one of the main reasons you are getting this device then I would recommend spending more money on a device with a better camera because this certainly is not satisfying for Skype purposes.Note: there was an improvement using an ethernet cable to skype instead of WiFi but still I wouldn't recommend this for an individual who is counting on a quality video chat session.If you are  using this tablet to check e-mail, surf the web, store some music and videos then its perfect considering its price and functionality. The SD Card slot and  mini HDMI are cool features that will allow you to store media and watch Netflix on your TV.You essentially get what you pay for. If you want to amaze your friends with an HD Screen, Touch sensitivity like iPads/Smart Phones, high quality video chat then this device isnt it.  Having said that, if you just need a cheap, affordable, functional device for email, surfing the web, and media storage then $119 bucks isnt bad for what you can do with this 10\" media device.I hope this was helpful for those interested in purchasing the iRuLu Tablet.", "Title": "Not bad for its price but not a quality device", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "C.

However, it's not the fastest device for surfing and or perusing through articles online.

As some of the other reviewers stated, the touch screen could be more responsive.  The person that gifted it to me also gave me some tablet styluses to use with it, which does improve the responsiveness - it's better with the stylus than with my finger.  Also, I calibrated the screen several times, which helps as well.  Turning on the pointer indicator makes a little glowing circle where you touch the screen, and this makes it easier to see exactly where you're touching it.Typing is frustrating due to the speed and lack of precision with the touch screen.  I might get a keyboard case for it, or I might just rely on my laptop for extensive typing.  This review is being typed on my laptop because I just couldn't do it on this tablet - it was driving me batty.  I've installed several apps on it so far, and any game app that requires speed/precision touch is NOT going to work.  So.... apps like Netflix -- awesome on this tablet.  Apps like Fruit Ninja or Scramble with Friends -- not good at all.  Surfing the web is OK as long as any embedded links have a large enough area to touch easily.  Same for any apps that do the same kind of thing.  Scrolling is haphazard, but I think I will be able to adjust to its particular quirks.Ok, next.  Headphone jack on mine is a little persnickity.  It doesn't work when the earphones are plugged all the way in, but does when they are *almost* all the way in.Screen clarity is good.  There's a glare, like another reviewer mentioned, but it's not really any different than what I've seen on other tablets (I've played with iPads, the Samsung tablets, and the ASUS tablets as well).  They're all pretty glarey in directional light.  Videos and movies look good on this screen.Battery life kind of stinks.  I tend to use this sort of device plugged in anyways, so that's not a big deal for me, but it probably is to other people, especially if you intend to use it to watch videos or be online on-the-go.  I read that one of the USB ports can also be used for charging, but I have not tried it yet.Getting connected to our home network was kind of entertaining.  There are at least 3 different MAC addresses on this tablet, and you have to make sure you use the right one.  Trial and error, but not a huge problem.  So far I have not been able to get it to recognize my Bluetooth, but I'm going to poke at it some more.I'm also going to be trying out the HDMI output on it soon to use it to stream Netflix to a TV.  Hopefully that will work, as I'd love to be able use it for that purpose rather than buying a separate streaming device for occasional use.All in all, it's no comparison to an iPad or similar device, but not a terrible choice for a lower-end \"starter\" tablet.

The only one I could get to work for some reason was crackle.  I don't know if doing a system restore might fix this but I am considering it, even with the ethernet cable which should be faster, netflix played for two minutes and began to lag and buffer and the rest don't work at all.  Makes the HDMI jack pretty useless too.No usb direct connect for computers.  It will not directly connect to any computer except through a wifi network.  If you have at least windows 7 it would only take a minute to set up a shared folder for your network that the tablet could connect to for file trading.  Just download something like ES File Explorer on the tablet side and this won't be much of a problem.  Wifi will solve this, but the file exchanging takes considerably longer this way.  Or you could use a thumb drive/minisd if there are a lot of files.Now the positives:In the questions section it says that you cannot use the two finger zoom, in the Chrome Browser at least I can but consider that there are different models of this same tablet, mine is AL106.It's cheap, its a savings compared to other 10\" tablets out there.Expandable memory via mini SD card or usb thumbdrive.Large screen great for reading books or surfing.Decent battery life, mine hasn't been plugged in for 10 hours.

After looking at lots of tablets I just couldn't see someone spending a huge amount for the features that come on the pricier tablets.  It does not have a capacitive screen but I don't notice this, you can still swipe and tap to your hearts content.  I have tried out some friends iPads and have not found them to be intuitive or easier to use.  I was mostly looking to upgrade to a bigger screen size from my previous android e-reader and this is fabulous for that and I would highly recommend it to those looking for a larger screen reader.  I installed the kindle app and can now even read my kindle books on this thing.  All of the apps I've loaded run smoothly and it came with the full legitimate google play store to find new apps for it if you like buying them.  The battery life is not as long as my smaller tablet was but seems good as long as you don't run the wifi perpetually and there's even a control console on the main screen that lets you toggle the wifi on and off which helps a lot with battery life.  I'm not really into playing graphics intensive games on a tablet so I wouldn't be able to judge it's efficiency for this(I don't know if you can play Angry Birds well on it) but I have watched a couple of videos on it so far and they seem to run really well on it.  Overall I'm very happy.Update:  I've had the tablet now long enough to play with it a bit and have to remove a couple of stars because after only a month it is already starting to get really squirrelly.  It is still awesome for reading pdf documents and books on which is largely what I wanted it for however it is having a lot of trouble with apps.

One of the usb ports has also already stopped working.  Because it was so cheap I actually still consider it probably worth it's price as a 10.1\" pdf reader and it makes a really nice video player which is still working properly but it's functionality is becoming limited enough that I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting an all-purpose tablet.", "Title": "Really nice tablet for the price", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Author": "red417", "ReviewID": "R1NG4CDMX6CT29", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My son was thrilled when he opened up his Santa and got this gift.

I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. When it came in early December, I opened it up to make sure it charged and that everything worked. Indeed it did. I reopened it on Christmas and having been using it daily since. I'm thrilled with the performance of this tablet. You can't expect the speed and touch response of an iPad or similar device, but for the price it's outstanding. The model number I received was the iRulu AL101. Although the screen resolution is listed at 1280*720 in the product description, it's really only 1024x600. This wasn't a huge deal to me. It still works fine. It also lists the processor as an Infortm x210 ARM11, 1GHz Processor but mine only had an ARM8, 1GHz Processor. This still isn't that big of a deal.Both USB ports work very well. As a matter of fact the top port is USB 3.0 which surprisingly allows me to charge my tablet via a double-ended male USB 3.0 cable which I purchased on amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTZ07U/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00). This has been a very nice thing to add to my tablet because not only can I charge it on my laptop or using a 5V USB charger, but I can also download movies, music, etc. to my tablet via my laptop or desktop. The iRulu only comes with a charger which has a small connector, not USB.Another addition I made on the purchase date was a keyboard case. I bought the case and tablet through ACCDEPOT and they gave a small discount for buying both. When the keyboard case came, it didn't work. ACCDEPOT immediately sent me another case free of charge and it has been working since. The case is a fake leather and keeps the tablet well protected. The keyboard itself is a USB keyboard which I plug into the bottom USB 2.0 port. It's a very handy thing to have when typing anything - web browsing, taking notes, or even using any of the Apps that allow for Microsoft Word/Excel/etc. use. The keyboard itself also works really well - haven't had any problems with the second keyboard.I also bought a 32GB microSD class 10 flash card (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QZH7BU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) to add space to my tablet. At the time (Christmas Day 2012) the card cost $25 so it was a great deal. The iRulu comes with 8GB onboard, split up into several partitions (why it came in several partitions I don't know, but the full 8GB is there). With the microSD card I have a total of roughly 40GB to play with. I was easily able to put all my music onto the card and I've attempted to put a few TV shows and Movies on which all seem to work just fine. When I view any pictures, movies, or music in the appropriate media manager app, it automatically finds the pictures, movies, or music which is awesome. I don't have to tell the tablet where to look for the media. I'm sure this is probably an operating system feature, but it's very handy.With all my music and apps that I have on the iRulu it does seem to be a bit slower on boot up, but I think that's standard of any device when you've loaded numerous things onto it. Mostly it occurs when the home screen appears and it starts to load my e-mail, google calendar, and google tasks in their respective widgets.Overall I give the iRulu 10.1\" tablet 5 stars. With the ability to add more storage via the microSD card slot, the ability to surf the web wirelessly or via the onboard ethernet connector, the charging options, the mini hdmi, the speed which is very good for the price, and the price, this tablet is unbeatable. It's not perfect, but you can't expect perfection for $130. It's a great buy for the price.

No major issues with the device. The touch screen is not very smooth and responsive. The worst thing on this device is the ac/dc power plug. It uses a 1A plug which is the smallest plug and it's too long for the tablet. Which makes it weak and will break. We bought 2 of these and both adapters had broke on the same day. Wish we could use these tablets. Radio shack sells new ones for $47 each. This added expense kills this deal!I would suggest to stay away from this item until they change the plug to at least a 2A.3.5 Stars if this was not a problem.No customer service and no guide or warranty", "Title": "Design flaws and will cost you more in the long run", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "mdawg", "ReviewID": "RR28RIDHK0A87", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So my mom bought me this tablet for christmas. i started playing with it and like 20 minutes later it dyed! so i charged it and couldnt get it to turn back on! so i reset it, and contunued playing games.

Sharp", "ReviewID": "RBIH6QI4TLSCO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I bought this it was 30 dollars less then its currently be sold for and even that was too much.  The battery life is pretty bad, which means reading books or watching videos can't be done for extended times.  On my unit both Netflix and HULU PLUS are incompatible, which means no meaningful video watching can be done anyway.  That's common on lower quality tablets, especially HULU, so I was kind of expecting that.  The biggest concern is the touchscreen, its horrible.  I'm always having to rotate the screen to find the \"spot\" where touching it actually works.  I have liked using it as an e-reader, haven't had any internet issues and don't play games on it.  I like its having 8GB of memory, I loaded a couple of gigs of music and, using ear phones, liked the quality of the playback.
