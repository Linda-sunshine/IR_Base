The one I got has Android 4.2 installed.  It is very light, mostly made with plastic.  The screen is covered with a sheet of plastic to protect it during shipment.  It already has some charge but you would want to plug it for a full charge the first time you use it.  You can charge it either with the included AC adapter or with any existing USB charger you have in the house using a microUSB cable.  Battery seems not bad at all and I do not really expect it to lasts as long as my iPad's battery.What you get:Tablet, AC charger adapter (100-240V world voltage with 5V, 2,000 mAh output), microUSB, short USB extension and a short manualI put in an 8 gig TF card (otherwise known microUSB card) to expand the memory.  This will be very useful to put most of the pictures and videos.  Not much of use for the apps as the apps will reside mostly in the internal memory.  I think this is the biggest drawback as some apps can get really big and will put serious limitation to the number of apps you can install.The volume can be adjusted through a physical rocker switch on the side or with the touchscreen control.  Screen brightness can be adjusted as bright, medium and low via the touchscreen.I am impressed how it performed with some of the games (maybe because I was expecting a lot?).  Angry Birds Go which is crashing on my son's first gen mini iPad plays OK.  It only stalled on the training sequence but played fine on the actual race.  Temple Run2, Frozen, also played fine.  I am more used to IOS navigation so there was some learning curve, but after using it for a few hours, I feel it was not that difficult at all.  One thing I really miss is a physical home button.  The tablet represents it with the house-shaped icon at the bottom middle screen. The touchscreen is responsive except when it gets hampered by the internet.  I like the looks and how the clock, timer and stopwatch works.  I have not seen any compass if it has one.Kindle app synched into my account right away and I was able to open the books with almost identical interface.Finally I tinkered with Skype. It works. My daughter was having a blast video calling to her brother and cousins.  You can switch the camera back and front like Facetime. Again, the main difference is the cameras which is inferior to what we are used to.I didn't like that the 3.5mm audio jack located on top which makes the cord hangs in front of the screen when watching.What it can do:- Watching YouTube works great- Works even with recently released games like Angry Birds Go and Temple Run 2.- You need more light but you can call via video SkypeLimitation:- Cannot place a lot of apps as they reside mainly in the internal memory rather than the external memory.- According to the description, it can play Netflix. I downloaded it alright and navigates smoothly through the menus, but only audio and captions show up. No video. I tried downloading an apk to fix it but it won't install. Amazon Instant Video doesn't work likewise.- Capturing pictures and videos through the cameras are low res, muddy and distorted. Low light performance is much worse.- Resolution: 800*480 pixels- Screen brightness doesn't do much.  It is only bright, medium and low.  Still, you don't see much difference at all.Cons:- It behaves erratically at times, some of the apps would work alright and then stops working after a few days and requires to be downloaded and installed again.", "Title": "A decent budget Android tablet", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Author": "Geraldine Gregory", "ReviewID": "R8O9GBL27YG06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my 6 year old granddaughter loves this so she can play games by herself it arrived in just a few days earlier than i expected to great deal.", "Title": "love this tablet", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "Frank Jetton", "ReviewID": "R21GSCKWCOMNP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tablet came with a screen protector.
