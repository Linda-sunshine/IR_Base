Fearing that she would break a >$300 device we bought this. I sent it back 2 days after it arrived for several reasons. The leapfrog2 came out in 2012, so i figured it would at least have decent hardware on par with like a first gen ipad with a worse screen. I was wrong. This thing is simply archaic.1. There are no usable apps pre-loaded on the device. I know it says there are like 10 apps int eh description, but none of them are worth spending 30 seconds on.2. There are no free apps available in the leapfrog app store. The decent ones are all $10, which is rediculous in 2014, when most apps on real tablets have free versions avialable to try out and are less than $5 to buy if you like them.3. No wifi connectivity. Installing software required hooking up to a computer via USB cable. I knew about this before we bought it, but still super lame.4 The camera is terrible. It's like a cell phone from 2006.5. The screen is tiny, and also terrible. Again like a cell phone from 2006.6. The stylus is unnnecessary and an eye poke hazard. In the 10 minutes that my daughter played with this thing, she nearly poked herself in the eye twice.I don't know why this thing has so many good reviews on Amazon. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, much less $90.

Gilbert \"Fantasy Fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R2C8Q21BC2WUNV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We thought we were being smart by purchasing this LeapPad verses the Ultra because of all the poor reviews from so many disappointed parents.  Our 6 year old showed a lot of interest when we first introduced this to him, of course he did, it was new.  However, the games for this are ridiculously over priced for what you actually get.  We would buy him a game and he either beat it or lost interest with it within a day or two.  The apps and games are also ridiculously priced, and most of the games are way...way to \"generic\".  They have a few Disney/Pixar themed games, but most of them are lame....sorry.  LeapPad's in general, in my opinion at least, are a major waste of money.  The video camera that is built in is horrid, all grainy and very low quality.  At best this is a possibly \"OK\" toy for a 3-4 year old, kids are WAY to advanced nowadays for such a limited tablet.  It's freaking incredibly annoying because it constantly repeats directions over and over again regardless of how many times you've played.  Like the art app, every 5 seconds it repeats the directions until you want to throw the thing out the window.  It's a money trap for Parent's, they keep sending all kinds of promotions to keep buying the apps and games...and very few of them are worth the money they ask for.  No...sorry, if I could I would tell anyone to stay far far away from LeapPad.

My older kids all had Leapsters and I'm a big fan of LeapFrog and their products.  However, I think they need to realize that they can't charge $25 for an app these days, when my kids can buy an app for their Kindle Fire or iPad for 99 cents.  I understand that cartridges used to be $20, but the market has moved on.  I also hated that I had to hook up the LeapPad to my computer via a USB cable to update anything.  The advantages of the LeapPad is it's much more durable than a typical tablet (not sure compared to the Nabi, and the LeapFrog games have been tested and perfected for years.  My kids love playing the games\u2026but more than the other apps? I can't say that.I loved (and my daughter loved) the Doc McStuffins design.  It's adorable.  The LeapPad is pretty easy to set up.  You have to put the rechargeable batteries in (put the square like tab in first\u2026then the cylinder)\u2026and charge it, before connecting it to your computer to download the 9 free apps.  The $20 card it came with is great, but once again, with the price of the apps, you can still end up shelling out $5 for a lot of apps, or might get one to download without additional money.Once again, I'm a big fan of their products, but I don't see that this is any better than the Kindle Fire with FreeTime we have for the kids, or even a regular iPad.  The price point for the LeapPad is less, but with the $30 off deals for KindleFire, and the Prime deal on Free Time which gives you new monthly content for your kids, you'll end up saving long term.If LeapFrog dropped the price on their apps, nothing should be more than $9.99, and most should be under $5.00, then I'd give it five stars.  But with the price of the apps today, I can't.", "Title": "3 Year Old Loves It, Mom Thinks Apps are Too Expensive", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Gertrude, the Innocent \"Live well, laugh loud...", "ReviewID": "R3J46WLU6YTWQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are huge fans of all things LeapFrog. Our children have grown up with a variety of LeapFrog handhelds and other devices that have served them well in teaching them reading and math, and even logic and reasoning skills. I love the effortlessness of the games and education. Education should be fun and should be rewarding: it sets children up with a lifelong love of reading and learning.This is the second of our themed LeapPad2s and this is another winner. These colors are a welcome change to the longstanding green or pink variations - which really were a sad selection of colors - oh, and before that, the white didjes. Our first Bundled set was LeapFrog LeapPad2 Disney/Pixar Monsters University Varsity Edition Bundle and it is just gorgeous. It even has little horns on the top of the gel skin featuring Mike.I like these bundle packages especially. The value to them is better than buying the parts, separately of course. The included battery pack is also a great improvement to these devices. The battery pack is a game changer.Once you set this LeapPad2 up with the basic info and connect it to your computer, the update should happen pretty quickly. Mine didn't take a full minute. It downloads the apps: Learning Songs, Art Studio, Clock, Calendar, NotePad and calendar and one app you choose from the 3 offered. Every time I have set a LeapPad up lately, I have been offered a discount based on how many apps I buy, up to 30% off from 3 or more. This deal is far better than the discounts that come in emails and I try to make sure I take advantage of them, even using my extra digital download cards to stock up.Multiple device app downloads: For a long time, you needed to purchase one app for each device, unless you ordered the game cartridges. LeapFrog has become a lot more reasonable lately. With these more recent LeapPad 2s and Ultras we are now able to purchase an app once and download it on up to three devices. This was a long time coming but they certainly made me appreciate it when it happened. There is something of a guessing game that goes on when I run up against a usage limit on one of the apps and then have to find which device it is on. This has happened to us with Stretchy Monkey, Reef Builder, Letter Factory, Elements on the Loose, Scooby Doo Spelling, and Disney Planes. These have been the favorite apps, by far. It is still better than only being able to download one app to one device.You can buy download cards on Amazon at various prices. I keep them in my shopping cart and watch the prices. The lowest I had ever seen was at $14, except for one brief shining moment. But when you combine these cards with the discounts you will get through emails, they can bring the price of apps down significantly. I buy them on sale and then wait until I hook up a new device so that I get the first hookup discount. :DAnother thing that I love as a teacher, a parent, and a grandparent, is how responsive LeapFrog is to suggestions and requests by parents and teachers.", "Title": "Bright, shiny, and pretty!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Andrea Thomas", "ReviewID": "RYN9RYZ53UCKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this as a gift for a 22 month old girl.

Based on LeapFrog\u2019s reputation and the reviews of this tablet posted on Amazon, I purchased the \u201cLeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet\u201d for my four-year old grandson.  I also purchased the \u201cLeapPad get Ready for 1st Grade Game Bundle for Boys\u201d directly from LeapFrog since it was not available from Amazon.Weighing 15.8 oz., the LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet is sturdy enough to withstand young, enthusiastic users\u2019 handling.  The 2 9/16\u201d X 3 7/8\u201d screen is quite small and images depicted on it are less detailed than adults might like.  However, children do seem to find the cartoon figures and graphics appealing.  Instructions included with the tablet were lacking in detail and provide little assistance when it comes to setting up the LeapPad2.  Games in the bundles I purchased are not particularly engaging.  My grandson liked watching the Cars cartridge because it included Lightening McQueen and Mater; I was less than impressed with the educational value of the cartridge.Although my grandson loves his \u201cpad\u201d, I think a Kindle Fire HD would have been a more practical and useful choice.  It has a larger screen, the cost of the game/learning apps is less than the price of LeapFrog cartridges; and the support for Kindle is far superior to LeapFrog\u2019s.  If you are looking for a sturdy tablet for younger children, you may want to consider the \u201cLeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet\u201d.

One thing I can say about LeapPads is that the absence of WiFI is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  Being they are targeted for much smaller kids and primarily for education, without WiFI it is a safer device in terms of contents and the risk of getting viruses.  But without WiFI, it also limits the device's capability.  Specially annoying when you need to download a game or needs an update.  You will always need it to be plugged with a cable tethered to your PC.Difference between the regular LeapPad2 and LeapPad2 Power:- The biggest difference is the rechargeable batteries and AC power adapter- Calculator, Calendar, Note Pad and Clock.  My daughter is excited the most with the calc.Comes with:- MicroUSB cable- 2 styluses- AC adapter- Rechargeable batteriesPros:- No WiFI- Educational- Will also work with regular four double As- We have dropped it many times and still chugging-a-long- Rechargeable- Can play purchased movies from the LeapPad site.  She love the Barbie movies.Cons:- No WiFi- Disappointing battery life.  You will find charging it more often compared to an iPad or Nintendo handhelds- Downloading a game or an update is not user friendly.  Sometimes you would need to do it a few times and sometimes it would not even update.", "Title": "More convenient LeapPad2 rechargeable", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Author": "Celeste \"Vodka, Apple Pucker & Sweet 'n' Sour\"", "ReviewID": "R2VPIGRZB0RCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I just assumed that this came with a Doc McStuffins game. To be clear, it does not. At the time of this review, this version costs about ten bucks more than the pink version.

I\u2019m not sure how much use you will get out of the extra stylus as the stylus connects to the LeapPad. Generally, I would say that unless your child is a pretty hard-core Doc McStuffins fan, going with the plain pink LeapPad2 may be a better option.As for the LeapPad itself, it has some great upgrades from the previous LeapPad.

Then when we move the batteries around or plug in and take batteries out or do some sort of trick, we can get it to turn on.  Then eventually it just turns off and you can't get it to turn back on.

I was a little apprehensive about giving it as a gift as she hadn't asked for anything like it. She loved this game system. She is constantly using the camera and switching the skins. She knows how to do everything she needs for it to function. I like that it came with a charger, so we aren't wasting a ton of money on batteries. I also like that it came with extra styluses. The cons I have found were that it took a very long time to set up. I wanted to make sure it was charged and completely ready for Christmas morning. I believe it took 2 hours to set up! I had to update the Leap Frog connect on my computer twice before I was able to download games and then put in her information. I am also disappointed in the computer software, but that is another story for another day. Oh, and the games are expensive. Thankfully it comes with a few and I was fortunate enough to find some ebook cartridges for alot cheaper at a local store. It would've been very disappointing if they didn't include the $20 giftcard.Overall,we are very pleased with this product.", "Title": "Great Deal!", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Author": "Gadget Girl", "ReviewID": "RUUTEYD8V5OLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have two other Leappads (A Leap Pad 1 and a Monsters Univ. Bundle Leap Pad 2).  The Doc McStuffins LeapPad 2 Power Bundle is my favorite and in my opinion the best value.  This bundle includes a battery recharger and AC adapter, which is worth its weight in gold (actual value: $40).  It also includes a $20 download card for the LeapFrog store, two extra styli (one purple, one pink) as well as a USB cord.We already have a variety of games and eBook cartridges (Cinderella, Bubble Guppies, Dora, Phineas and Ferb, iSpy, Jake and Neverland Pirates, etc). The downlard card can be used in LeapFrog AppCenter to purchase games, ebooks and videos.  Browsing content and uploading to the LeapPad is simple.  You can install the same content on multiple LeapPads in your family.  We've mostly purchased videos such as episodes of Dora and Bubble Guppies for restaurants and car rides.  The drawing app that comes with the LeapPad is also a favorite of my daughter.Setup is relatively simple using LeapFrog Connect software.  The features that the LeapPad 2 adds above the original Leappad is a front-facing camera, more memory (4 GB vs 2 GB) and better battery life.  The LeapPad 2 Power adds the battery recharger and AC adapter but is otherwise the same product.  (Though this bundle comes with 2 extra styli and usually you get 1 extra).Let me tell you, the included battery recharger is worth its weight in gold!  The Leap Pad 1 drains batteries and the battery case was difficult to open (had to use stylus or a penny).  The Leappad 2 adds a better batter compartment, but the LeapPad 2 power includes the battery recharger... it's easy to use and lasts about 8 hours of use.  It can be recharged using the AC adapter without having the remove the batteries from the compartment.  In an \"emergency\" you could still swap out the battery recharger for four AA batteries (regular or rechargeable), but with the longer battery life, this should not be needed in everyday use.The Doc McStuffins design is very cute - my 4 year old daughter is a huge fan of the show.  The Amazon frustration free packaging made it easy to open and get started.  No clamshell or excess packaging, just a few cardboard separators and a few twist ties for the cords.  The batteries came with some charge and you can set up the LeapPad right out of the box.  You can create a profile for up to 3 children on the same device, plus a \"Guest\" user.  However, to use any of the content you must first hook to the LeapFrog Connect Application via a computer.  If you are giving this as a gift and you know your child will want to check it out right away, you could set it up and put it back into the box without much trouble.Overall, the LeapPad 2 Power is a great product for kids age 3-9.  Some of the apps are a little challenging for my 4 year old, but she will grow into the device with time.  I don't have to worry about durability or her breaking it.  It's nice and solid, her LeapPad (original) is still going strong (though no longer used often since we've upgraded due to better battery life on the LeapPad 2s).

A modest \"app bundle\" is $80. He said he's \"dropped at least $200 worth of apps\" into his son's unit. Also, there are some things that are really painful for little girls: click on the 'Tangled' icon and you get NOT a princess app, but an ad to buy the Tangled app. grrrHaving said all that, if you are happy spending and spending (as the LeapFrog folks intend that you do) then this could be OK for you.

The styluses are a different shade of purple than the normal ones, plus there's a hot pink one too. The wallpapers are cute-but-not-cutesy. The $20 gift card will buy three or four non-movie-tie-in games, and LeapFrog has some great educational games (the cooking one is teaching our preschooler fractions).I have some trouble with LeapPads overall - they're very slow to start up or load games. Clearly one of the reasons this devices can stay under $100 is because they don't have top-of-the-line processors and such, but start-up can take so long that my kid actually wanders off and starts playing with something else instead. Some of the apps are also very pestering, like the drawing app that takes 5 seconds of inactivity as a cue that it should remind you, for the billionth time, how to select a drawing tool.But as i mention above, amidst the money-grab movie-tie-in games that'll set you back a pile of cash for very simple gameplay, there are the LeapFrog games that teach math, science, logic, problem solving, and other useful skills. My preschooler is already starting to resist 'work time' at school, with number and letter worksheets, but will play the cooking game for half an hour straight and clearly have learned from it.A full charge of the LeapPad battery pack lasts longer than four AA batteries, too, which is great.

Overall, they're all great products, but this is the first \"Power\" version we've ever had (that wasn't an Ultra). In the past, we've typically used rechargeable batteries, but it's nice to be able to have a LeapPad 2 that is rechargeable. Overall, it makes it more simple, and the kids can even plug it in to continue to play if the batteries die.In terms of this being a Doc McStuffins specific bundle, my 2 year old daughter is a big fan of Doc. We had previously given her a green LeapPad 2, but this one was so much better for her. She loves the included Doc backgrounds, and the designs on the device itself. As others have said, it is a bit sad they didn't include the actual Doc McStuffins game. That being said, we did already own it, so it wouldn't have been much of a benefit for us anyway. I do feel like other bundles I've seen had the game included, but I may be mistaken. The $20 download card is always a nice plus, and could certainly be used to purchase the game. Leapfrog always has discount codes, so it's pretty easy to get a game like Doc McStuffins for under $20 (regularly $25).Other than the above, it's a pretty normal LeapPad 2.

Boy am I glad we didn't spend money on it.The good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  Out of the box, the Leap Pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the Leap Frog website.When my daughter first got the Leap Pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  I was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.After playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  By the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the Leap Pad and was right back with the phone.  While giving in and letting her borrow my phone, I decided to see what this Leap Pad is all about.  Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.The package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the Leap Frog website.  Among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that \"teaches\" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  There is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  To the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.The package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the Leap Frog website.  At first I was pretty impressed.  The apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  The apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of \"educational\" material.  I was able to get five apps, so I was pretty happy.  At first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.The problem is, the apps are junk.  The games are very simplistic and repetitive.  Among the games we got, there were two themes.  Three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  Two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to \"free\" something (a polar bear, for instance).  The one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.I'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  I'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  But who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  It's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  You can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.Once you set up the device and register your child(ren), Leap Frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's \"progress\".  This is to give further credibility to Leap Pad as an \"educational learning tool\".  The fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  Memorizing facts is not \"learning\".  Age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  None of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled \"play\" on a gadget.In any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  If you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  There are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  It may not look as inviting and \"child-friendly\" as this device with its two extra styluses and Doc McStuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.Update 3/13/14:  Two other things I forgot to mention.  First, the Leap Pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  Second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but I find a bit bizarre.  I don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer.", "Title": "So not worth it - maybe 1.5 stars", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amanda gentle", "ReviewID": "R1RJ9N4GS8N14A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a must have for little kids!

I am not going to give it a bad review but am only going to compare it to Innotab 2 which I had returned in order to get this for my three year old.What makes this deal seem interesting is that they give you a 20 dollar card to spend on their market. Let me repeat, their market! Unlike the Innotab 2, which allows you to youtube, upload music and movies, and other things similar to what a typical tablet will do (bare minimum), the Leap Pad 2 allows only their products which are pretty expensive. I must add though, if you get two or more games, videos etc from their website, they will give you a discount. But these games are still 25 a pop. And none free to get either which is ridiculous. That means no outside parties are allowed to add anything to this monopolized market they call the Leap Pad store.However faster than the Innotab 2 with a way better camera, that doesn't compensate for the lack of stuff I can do on an Leappad2. Granted, my 3 year old gives a crap about stuff and more about Mickey Mouse!!! So my problem is a daddy issue and not a kid issue. I have to admit, I either want the Innotab 2 back just for more versatility (so slow though), or I want something in between these two devices.The 20 dollar gift card did get me a couple items only because they give you a discount. Just remember, Innotab 2 lets you do whatever but horrible camera and speeds while Leappad 2 gives you NO VERSATILITY but decent camera and decent speeds.

Put a few more on and you've covered the cost of the otterbox cover for the kindle fire HD 7\" as well. Want to put your own media on this device? That will cost you as you have to buy an app for that. Want to do anything other than the basics that are included? That will cost you money. The kindle has access to many free apps that will not cost you any money and are great for kids. I do like how durable the LeapPad2 is as it can take some abuse, but so can a kindle with the right protective case. My child got bored with this is less than a month since he was also exposed to a kindle at nearly the same time. To recap, if you plan on putting as few as 10 apps on the LeapPad2 you will have spent what the kindle fire HD 7\" costs. Also, my son was able to scratch the screen on the first day of use.

We are the kind of family that wants to delay our kids exposure to electronics (e.g. our kids don't have video games and they don't use our cell phones either). But of course, when your kids have cousins and friends who own iPods at age 8, then it is hard to make a case without making the other parents look bad. In our case, we believe that our kids amazing imagination is a result of more play time with real toys. So we got the leap pad 2 as an alternative to those other electronics that our kids don't have. And it has been amazing. They actually are loving the camera and video feature. They make mini movies of themselves and take silly pictures. They also enjoy the other games. We only got one cartridge (rescue hero bots) and it has been very educational and entertaining. Right for my kids ages. So far we have been very pleased with it.I also wanted to mention that when we got the tablet, the battery lasted for only an hour or so. I charged for many hours but it didn't really charged. I got frustrated and regretted the purchases thinking of the reviews that I heard about the charger malfunction. I decided then to reinstall the tablet (which deleted what My son had done till then, fortunately it was not much because he just got it) and then try to charge it again. Then it worked perfectly.

Hall", "ReviewID": "R2QHDZF33CEU2H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hello- This is a writeup about my first impressions about the LeapPad2. They're in bullet for easy review.- More complicated than it needs to for a child- I was surprised at the number of decisions and that after almost every decision, the user needs to hit the check box. This creates a lot of unnecessary steps to get going. Example: Let's say I choose the Art application. I should be able to just get going and start drawing. Nope. I have to tap the app, hit a check box after the introduction, then select a 'tool', then am forced to select a color, then tap the check box, then I can draw. WOW. A child should just tap the art app, and start drawing. This is for a toddler, it doesn't need to be this complicated.- This still requires a Stylus. This caused great frustration and confusion for my 3yr old. She is accustomed to starting up the iPad and just getting going with her fingers. She hates the stylus and doesn't want to use it (I can relate). The 1990s called, they'd like they're stylus back.- No built in WiFi. You have to do everything teathered to your computer. Updates take forever and like bullet point 1, there are a lot of uncessary steps to get the device registed. Once registered, its all about buying more apps. Buy Buy Buy.. We get it.. you need to sell apps. Ok. I'll do it, but this is a pretty inconvenient way to do so.- There is no way to tell how charged your battery is. I can't find it anywhere. How do I know if its fully charged before I get on an airplane. On that note, there's no settings anywhere such as brightness, etc\u2026 I don't expect a child to care, but a parent does. If they are using it in the dark, it would be nice to turn down the brightness so it doesn't burn my kids eyes.- On the plus side, there are a lot of videos and apps to choose from and its nice that LeapFrog doesn't have the bottomless pit of problems that In-App purchases creates. Bravo LeapFrog. Thank you!- Our 3yr old is having problems getting going on it (compared to so naturally on the iPad), but once she's going, she seems to really like it. Everything on here is about learning and exploring which is great.My advice to LeapFrog\u2026 Ditch the expensive COGS of another pad device, and just make terrific application for computers and devices (Pads, Phones, and Computers).

For Christmas I got my 5 and 7 year old Kindle's but thought the Kindle would be too advanced for my 3 year old so I bought him the Leap Frog Leap Pad 2.  This device was a waste of money.  First of all I had to download a bunch of software from the Leap Frog website onto my computer (how lame is that?).  If I wanted kids stuff on my computer I wouldn't have purchased a Leap Frog Pad, I would've just let him use my computer.

She picked tight up on how to use the apps, take pictures, etc.  The apps and games are well chosen and focused on learning abilities.  However, the included content is severely limited (even though this is a 9-app bundle).  The \"included apps\" are things most people take for granted: a note-taking app, a music player (that does not support your own MP3s, and includes only one set of songs) and a \"camera app\" for a camera-equipped device.  Other \"extra\" features include the (very basic and altogether necessary) ability to charge the tablet by plugging it into an AC outlet.  The real problem, though, is when you want to buy more content.  Let's say you want the music to a favorite animated film.  Would you pay $10 for a measly 4 songs and a narrated story?  I did, and rightly felt robbed.  This device is, in fact, the most flagrant highway robbery since the invention of the $100 printer with $20 cartridges.  The Leappad2 itself is inexpensive and highly attractive, the included content well curated but extremely limited.  When you want to buy a game that would cost you $3 in an Android app store, with Leapfrog you fork up $10-20.  In the end, getting this $90 dollar tablet up to speed with a minimal amount of content set me back a total of $150.My advice, bottom line: buy a Kindle with FreeTime and stay clear of this pint-sized money pit.
