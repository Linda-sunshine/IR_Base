It freezes on me all the time. Very slow, poor graphics too. I even bought a 32 GB mini SD card for it thinking that if I put more memory in it that it would help it to work better. It has been sitting aside not even turned on for 2 weeks now. I wish I had NEVER wasted my money and by the time I got my SD card to see if that would help, I was past my return time. Please do not buy this tablet.", "Title": "Freezes all the time", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$92.99", "ProductID": "B00FFAD7K0", "Features": "Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, 9 inches Display\nAll winner ARM CORTEX A8 OMAP 3 1.2 GHz\n8 GB Flash Memory, 512 GB RAM Memory\n3 pounds", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41O1YIzUe5L._SX300_.jpg", "Name": "Kocaso M9100 M9100PUR 9-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Purple)"}}
