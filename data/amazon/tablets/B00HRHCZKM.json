However, the packaging was a disappointment.  The package appeared to have been previously opened.  I've had units come from overseas in better presentation, and I KNOW those units get mauled going through customs.  I got the impression this may have been a returned unit that got put back into stock and sent out again.  The product ad claimed the unit was new.  There are plenty of outlets where I can shop for returned/refurbished units.  I'm not saying it was a previous return, but that's the IMPRESSION I was left with.  A truly negative feeling!  The unit came under a Zenithink brand name as opposed to the advertised TURCOM.  It was loaded with Android 4.1 not the advertised 4.2.  TOTAL storage as reported by the unit's onboard diagnostics is 4.96GB vice the advertised 8GB.  I haven't yet loaded any of my own test apps to verify.  Could I have sent it back?  Certainly I could have tried.  Amazon has been wonderful.  BUT I SHOULDN\"T HAVE TO.  This should have been simple.  For the minimal cost I'll just learn a lesson and see if I can salvage any GPS utility from it.", "Title": "A disappointment to me", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Author": "Donald P Parent", "ReviewID": "R1SESOI94ICC0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall the unit is fine.  I have had a couple of issues where the reset button needed to be used to get the system to boot up but overall I am satisfied with the operation.  The tablet was purchased to run GPS software for backup to the Marine navigation systems used on board the vessels that we operate.", "Title": "The unit is being used as a back up GPS system for Boats", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00HRHCZKM", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
