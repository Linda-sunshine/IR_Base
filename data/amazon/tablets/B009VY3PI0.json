Would not charge so was basically defective and I had to return it. I did not trust ordering another one after that. The vendor shipped it out quickly enough and had it worked first time it might have been worth the money. THis particular model is flooding the market now under many different names. One caveat-I recently purchased a different tablet that is \"non-Google certified\" and it has given me nothing but trouble. Many of the Chinese tablets are not Google certified which affects the ability to install many applications, Googlesearch doesn't work well if at all and Play store and services will fail. Not sure if this one was or not, but make sure when purchasing. This has become more of a problem with the newer versions of Android as it seems Google wants to take over more control of the OS and it becoming more difficult to work around this if you do not want Google on your phone or tablet.", "Title": "Product review", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Author": "Office Expenses", "ReviewID": "R2F4NE3LBVNHJF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "these tablets have a six month warranty.

Then the battery indicator light they mention is no where to be found. When the charger is first plugged in a red battery flashes on to the screen, this turns green straight afterwards although the message if you use the thing says battery 15% I have no idea if it is charging or not and have not used it works properly, or how well it may perform, as I am waiting to see if it is in fact charging!!!
