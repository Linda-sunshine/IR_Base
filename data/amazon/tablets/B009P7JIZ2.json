{"Reviews": [{"Author": "RWBurnham \"Rob\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZY3JX200JN26", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:-The tablet body is light and attractive. The screen is gorgeous, despite the relatively low resolution. People have seen the tablet and commented on how attractive it is.-The CPU handles all Modern UI duties perfectly, despite being an older processor. Battery life is about the same as typical Android tablet.-Most desktop software runs fine, including older games like Icewind Dale II. I like that almost all of the buttons and connectors are in one location (upper right corner). Windows 8 feels very good on a touchscreen.-I think Microsoft has finally built an excellent mobile OS.Cons:-The desktop can get sluggish. Sometimes when I run a program, like an installation file, it will take about ten to fifteen seconds to open.-There were some minor bugs at first: wifi slow to connect when first booting up, occasional freeze, audio cutting. That would have fine as I could work around those, but then things got worse.-The tablet would go into sleep mode, as it should, but I was unable to get it to wake. I had to reset it to get back to the OS. I am not sure if the hardware was overheating (I was not running any actual software besides the OS) or there is a driver issue.-When I tried updating the graphics driver provided on the Acer website, it would install fine, but the computer would blue screen during restart and tell me it needed to restart. This is the first time a computer has tried to restart in the middle of a restart.-The lack of any sort of recovery media hinders my ability to reset to defaults, as it seems the backup on the tablet's drive is not working.-Acer's lack of accessories, aside from an overpriced keyboard dock, is troubling. Do they not have enough faith in this product to at least provided a form-fitting gel skin?Other Thoughts:-In theory, this is a suburb tablet. The tiled interface is fast, the app store has all the apps I need, and the desktop is a nice feature to have for the occasional bit of desktop software. I wanted so much to love this tablet, and for a short time I did.-In practice, this tablet is not ready for prime time. With the problems I mentioned above, I cannot recommend this unit.-It's hard to tell if this is a hardware problem, software problem, or a mix of both. Maybe this unit is a lemon? Whatever it is, the user experience is frustrating. Mind you, I am pretty well-versed in computers (I've been building them for 15 years), so I can only imagine a non-tech user wondering why they did not just buy an iPad.", "Title": "Great in Theory, Lousy in Execution", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "N. Mehta", "ReviewID": "R2VQ28MP6P79X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this from amazon a few weeks ago and loving it so far.I've always owned an android tablet previously but decided to go a different route this time due to this tablet being full windows 8.- Performance wise there is no lag at all in the modern ui, everything runs as it should, including the web browser. Going into the desktop mode is a different story, there is lag in pretty much everything you do. But I only use a very few applications in  desktop mode so that isn't much of an issue.- Battery life is pretty great, it lasts me all without the need to plug in the charger. I use it for web surfing and to watch videos (youtube and downloaded).- Considering the shell of the device is all plastic, the build quality is actually impressive, its sturdily built. Back of the device emulates a metallic surface.- Make sure to update the drivers from Acer's website, the built in Acer updater does not work.", "Title": "Love it!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "Joe CT \"PC guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1L0ACLUVC5CA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tablet.

First, let me say that the tablet itself has worked well. However there are some things you should know before you buy:1. If you have any trouble whatsoever with the tablet, Acer support will not even talk to you unless you have either the serial number or SNID number, both of which are printed on the edge of the tablet in size 2 or 3 font and are subject to smearing. If you buy, KEEP THE LABEL FROM THE BOX WITH THE SERIAL NUMBER.2. Don't buy the tablet without the docking station. If anything goes wrong with the Operating System, you will need the Function keys on the docking station in order to enter the BIOS to change the booting sequence.3. Immediately upon receipt of the tablet, create a USB recovery drive from the e-recovery partition on the hard drive (if you have one!). If you aren't able to create the USB recovery drive, you will have to access the recovery DVDs that come with the computer. To do that, you will not only have to have a DVD drive with a micro-USB connection, but you will have to have the docking station to access the BIOS.4. The Acer support people are totally worthless! Acer uses companies in India. There is a language barrier. The support people apparently can only follow their scripts, and they do not listen to what you are telling them.My complaints about Acer have mostly to do with their support system. If the serial number is going to be the key to accessing support then (1) they should make that very clear and stress the importance of recording the serial number and (2) they should print the serial number on a label in size 12 font, so it's legible, and place it on the back of the tablet, rather than on the edge. In addition, a tablet computer should not REQUIRE a docking station in order to recover its operating system. A docking station for a tablet should be a convenience, not a necessity. Finally, Acer needs to move its support back to the United States and employ people who are not only knowledgeable, but who are able to communicate and are willing to listen to the customer.", "Title": "Hidden Requirements", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jquillen", "ReviewID": "R1675X0B9M1YOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to preface this by saying that I received my tablet for free in exchange for a review on my website - but I wanted to add my review here on Amazon too because there aren't many yet.I am a PC, I love Windows, but hadn't used Windows 8 yet. Other than having a PC laptop, all of my other devices are Apple. I have had an iPhone since 2008 and got the iPad in 2010. I am used to iOS and had a hard time getting used to not only just a different operating system on the Acer, but that it was Windows 8, which I was totally unfamiliar with.I used the Acer Iconia off and on for about two months, and it is a pretty good tablet. I think that if I hadn't been so used to iOS from my years using Apple products, I probably would have loved it - after I learned how to use it. It is pretty fast, thanks to that Intel processor. And while the Acer Iconia doesn't have all of the apps I know and love from years of use on my iPhone, there were some great apps, and the camera is AWESOME! The camera is much better than the one on my phone or iPad, actually. My husband thinks I should sell my iPad and just use the Acer Iconia because it has more memory, a faster processor and the camera is a higher megapixel than my iPad.One of the main downsides to this is that since it is such a new product, the after market accessories aren't as readily available as for other kinds of tablets. I had a hard time finding a case for it, so ended up just sticking it in a sleeve.All in all, I'd say this is a good tablet, but if you have a hard time learning new systems, Windows 8 might severely frustrate you (like it did me!).UPDATE: It's been almost a year since I wrote this review on the Acer, so I wanted to update my review. Once I got used to Windows 8, I actually prefer the tablet over my iPad - so much so that I gave my iPad to my husband! I even got a Windows 8 laptop now and love it too!", "Title": "Windows 8 is hard to get used to but worth it!", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Corrine Jackson", "ReviewID": "RFQB3YY2R9ODG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has everything I need to use with my quilt machine.
