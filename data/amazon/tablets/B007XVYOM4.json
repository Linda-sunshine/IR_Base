Sometimes it won't work and other times you try to scroll to another page and instead it selects something on the first page.  Sorry that's not to clear, not sure how to explain it.Also the battery compartment is a choking hazard, they have this stupid slide switch that releases the compartment.  My daughter figured it out in 2 seconds and had a battery in her mouth.  Bought a cover for the innotab to hopefully stop that but she just takes that off.  Every other toy has a screw on the compartment, why not this?Overall we have found this tablet to be more of a frustration and a chore than anything, would not recommend it.", "Title": "terrible", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bryan Lutgen \"bd180\"", "ReviewID": "RJ7VOFELP8Y8O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My two Girls loved it but the screen is very scratched up from the constant use.
