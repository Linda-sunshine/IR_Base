I have owned at least five tablets within the last two years, and out of all of them this has been the best overall. Except, maybe, for the Acer a 100 I purchased in the beginning two years ago.this tablet has the same screen size as the iPad mini, but this one also has everything with it including extra SD memory card slot. Also it has the front and rear facing cameras, plus quad core processor!!! Not to mention it has a high definition screen and all the extras including bluetooth 4.0.  I can easily hold it with one hand without any issues.  Unlike what it says in the description, this comes fully equipped with Android 4.2.2.  This tablet is super fast!  It also comes equipped with GPS, I opened Google Navigation and within seconds, it connected to satellites and found me within 1 foot of where I was!  What's great is the fact that it doesn't have to be connected to the internet for directions. I immediately hopped in my car and drove forty-five miles to my parents house and it got me there in one piece without any wifi connection whatsoever. I can honestly say I think this tablet deserves five stars across the board! Absoluely a fabulous tablet and I recommend it to anyone and everyone wanting a tablet. The best thing about this tablet, is the fact that it is under $200. That is an unbelievable price for a quad core processor for Android 4.2 tablet!!!  In fact, this tablet out does earlier Acer models, there are not any heat problems with this model either.  Just buy it, you will not regret it!  This tablet is even better than the iPad mini easily.  Just try it, you will definitely agree.  Wow!  I spoke this review via the microphone option on my Acer a1-810 tablet.  It does great!", "Title": "what a tablet!!", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "W.

I have an apple ipad mini and I love the screen size over the more common 7inch tablets most brands are offering now. I love the fact than I can view flash content videos which the mini iPad couldn't do.Enter the acer a1:The good:It has the lovely 7.9inch screen ratio 4:3 for better web browsing. I'm not fond of 16:9 formats.Quad core - Boot up is 1 sec slower than ipad mini.HDMI !! Very useful for playing movies on.External sd! I just inserted a 16GB microSD - it works :)Cheap!The bad:1)Larger, thicker and 100g heavier than ipad mini.2)Front camera is pretty bad for webcam. Acer placed the 5MP camera at the back.3) Although the resolution is supposedly similar to Ipad Mini, the Acer is really less sharp and has yellow cast in the whites. The screen is really not as good as the IPAD mini. Image looks sunken in - unlike Samsung & Ipads - image appears near surface of screen. (viewing angle is also not as good).4)Battery life is not comparable to iPad mini - ipads are invincible when it comes to battery life.5)The speaker is too soft!6) Web browsing tends to hang sometimes.At half the price it is very good.Plus i can now watch flash content and live streaming, which the main reason I bought this pad for.UPdate: 17th July 2013I realise a bug in the Acer A1 8100:Took 4 hours to trouble shoot.If you enable the 4 tap image enlarger (correction: its actually 3 tap image enlarger - under settings=> accessibility), the tap function of the pad delays up to a second making it impossible to play pinball and all tap games.So I disabled the 3 tap imager enlarger under \"settings=>accessibility\" and the tap becomes ultra responsive now.", "Title": "The right size at the right price!", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NIT05H8RI2X2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first *new* tablet recently, an Acer Iconia (A1-810). My old Galaxy Tab was from a client. The Acer has a 7.9\" screen, front (skype) and rear (5.0mp) cameras, HDMI output (for video to your HDTV) and a MicroSD expansion slot (you can add more storage to it).I had it on my Amazon wish list at $199.99. It dropped to $169.99 and I got an Amazon gift card for my birthday so I snapped it up. I have Amazon Prime, with 2-day shipping. I got it in about 30 hours! I must live near one of their fulfillment centers.So far, I'm happy with it. What makes a good tablet depends on your use case. Some people want to carry around a portable cinema to watch videos on. If so, this is not the tablet for you. My main uses for it are Google Maps / Google Earth, traffic maps, PC remote control (e.g. Teamviewer), e-books (e.g. Kindle), web browsing and sometimes working with documents (Word, Excel). The GPS works without a WiFi connection, I'll never be lost again! Skype, on-the-spot picture taking, light gaming and of course, e-mail.The tablet is adequate for all of these tasks (or it should be, haven't tried all of them yet). I'd venture to say it is the best under-$200 tablet you can buy for these uses, and damn sure the best for under $170!Pros: Great screen size and form-factor (4:3) for web browsing, looking at maps, remote-controlling my PC and for reading e-books. Front and rear cameras, GPS without a data plan, Android 4.2.2, expandable storage.Cons: OK but not great for movies and video. Built-in speaker sucks. Rather heavy and unwieldy for reading in bed (still much easier than a hardcover book!).

I LOVE the size.  The 7\" is just a bit too small for my eyesight.  This 7.9\" acer just feels right.  I have the ipad 3 and I like it, but I don't care for the size. Too big for my purse.  My 14 year old sort of took it over anyway!  So, I wanted something just for me and I didn't want to spend a fortune.  And I wanted it to be lightweight.  This is lightweight (just short of 14 oz, weighed it on my food scale).  I like the bezel on the sides, because if there isn't a  big enough bezel it's too easy to hit stuff on the touch screen you don't want to.  I originally thought I wouldn't like it because it didn't have flash.  Then I learned that adobe quit supporting flash on all mobile devices, and any android after I believe 4.0 won't have a flash made for it.  I learned that basically most websites are using things other than flash due to their decision not to support it.  If you have an older device you probably already have it Flash - after Anddroid 2.2 I believe - but it will no longer be updated or supported. I go to a Weight wtchrs site and wanted to do the recipe builder but it said my device didn't support flash.  All I did was download Firefox from Android market and then I went to the adobe website and downloaded the last archived flash for android app (you won't find it on Google play).  I was then able to use that function when on Firefox.  Other than that I have not gotten the annoying 'flash' message on the android browser or on chrome.  The camera on the back is pretty good, not great in low light but not bad.  Keep in mind it cost $169.00 and you get a 5 mp camera with it, that's pretty amazing.  I don't do Skype, and don't really have a use for the front camera, so I can't comment on how good that is.  This also has face recognition for unlocking, if you want to use it.  It is fast and fun to use.  The 'negatives' are the sound - not so loud, but I'm ok with that for the price.  The screen isn't quite as crisp or bright as the Ipad, but also to be expected for the price.  I haven't tried the HDMI out yet, gotta get a mini hdmi cable.  So I can't comment on that yet.  The battery life has been pretty decent too, not as awe-inspiring as the ipad...but again, the price.  I have a mifi that I use for this when we go to our camper.  It's an at&t; mifi, and something odd did happen when trying to access the internet.  When my son was on the ipad surfing the web, and I was as well, the touch screen acted goofy.  Some links just couldn't be clicked on.  But once he got off his ipad, it worked fine.  So, I think it must have something to do with the mifi strength or something...just really odd.  They both work great together on our home cable wifi.  One thing I also couldn't get to work - the GPS without wifi support.  I hoped it would, but it didn't work on my lg optimus 9 phone without wifi, and it didn't work on the ipad of course (no high speed internet on the ipad, and no gps on the wifi only ipad, so even with a supporting wifi, no gps).  Maybe it's operator error, but I have not had much luck with it.  Also, as far as build quality, I think it's fine, but some would feel it was little too thick.  It's a bit 'plasticy' but that's fine with me.  Once I put it in the case that I ordered from Amazon, it won't matter anyway.  To surmise - I've had it a few weeks.  I'm happy with it and so far so good.  Cannot yet speak to it's longevity, but hopefully it will last a few years.

One would have thought that a tablet this inexpensive and somewhat of an off brand would have been even worse than those I had already tried. However, I was surprised to find that this tablet performs quite well and has given me no problems at all, with the strange exception noted below.The touchscreen was at first quite difficult to use. One had to almost punch the screen before getting a response. As another reviewer said, you have to press so hard that you come to feel that the screen might be resistive rather than capacitive. However, I finally figured out that it must be some kind of grounding problem that can be dealt with. When I had to punch the screen to get a response, the tablet was in a case that I purchased at the same time as the tablet. So, the tablet had always been in the case. I noticed that if I was charging the tablet, the touchscreen behaved normally and responded to normal pressure touches. Then I tried the tablet without the case and, if I held it in my hands, the touchscreen also behaved normally under those circumstances. I don't mind using the tablet without a case, but I took off one star from an otherwise five star product, for the inconvenience and potential for damage if dropped.I have thought because of the touchscreen issue that perhaps I have a defective tablet, but, as noted above, other reviewers have seen the same thing. Also, my pervious experience with the Google/ASUS and Samsung tablets, suggests that defects are often not specific to one sample but are generic or at least quite common. In other words, I would probably have the same touchscreen issue if I exchanged the tablet and possibly other problems also.Other than this, the screen is somewhat low resolution but looks OK and videos also look fine, even HD movies. For movies, you need to set the brightness to its maximum value, which is fine for viewing movies but, for some reason, is nowhere near as bright as other tablets I have used. There apparently is not an ambient light sensor, so there is no auto brightness control.Music sounds good through headphones. I have only used the tablet's speakers for touch sounds and notifications. I haven't noticed any delays in responding or jerky playback of videos. I haven't had any freezes or reboots (this was the major problem with the Nexus 7's). I am still learning how to preserve battery life by turning off functions I don't need, but the battery life is not bad. I need to recharge by the end of the second day, or sooner if I watch a movie.I use the tablet multiple times every day and I like using it. I would recommend it to someone else, with the caveats noted above.Update: The difficulty getting the touchscreen to respond has been getting worse over time, even when hand held. Also, I noticed that a stylus was essentially ineffective in evoking a response from the touchscreen, again even when hand held. At this point, it seemed inescapable that I had a defective unit that might eventually become completely unresponsive. I, therefore, decided to return the item. I still feel that if you happen to get one of these in which the touchscreen works properly, it is a very good tablet.", "Title": "Good value and performance", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Paul \"Paul\"", "ReviewID": "R3PIK6PIPU2OIJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is by far the best mix of performance and price I have found in small tablets. But perhaps the biggest reason to love this is the aspect ratio: it is 4:3 rather than the standard 16:9 used by the vast majority of Android tablets.I have a 7\" tablet which I use mostly for reading and web browsing, but the screen is just too small to comfortably view most web pages. I want a \"one-hand-able\" device so don't want a 9/10\" tablet, so a 4:3 small tablet is the perfect mix. The iPad Mini would be great hardware-wise, but I strongly prefer Android to iOS.Except when viewing movies (which I rarely do) I hold the device in Portrait mode, and the extra screen width makes a huge difference. For example, the screen is nearly 40% larger than a 7\" tablet, and is actually *wider* than 9\" tablets, but much shorter, lighter, and less expensive.PROS4:3 aspect ratioLightness and portabilityExcellent build qualityAndroid, not iOSMuch cheaper than an iPad miniMore tablet-aware apps than I expectedQuad-core CPU performanceUSB port, SD card slotLatest 4.2.2 Android releaseCONSNon-Retina display (1024x768, same as iPad Mini)Slightly larger than an iPad Mini, so its accessories (e.g., covers) cannot be usedNot as many tablet-aware apps as the iPad MiniMy first unit would not boot up, but an amazingly quick and painless return process (thanks Amazon!) had a new and perfect unit at my door in 36 hours.NOTE ON L416 vs L888 MODELS:There are two model numbers of this tablet: A1-810-L416 and -L888. Each is listed for sale separately at Amazon, which has led to much confusion.Contrary to information in other reviews/answers above, L888 is merely a minor hardware revision--the fundamental hardware/software specs are identical: [...]The only difference seems to be the CPU: L416 uses the Cortex A7, L888 is A9. Sources differ on which is better. This is the best article I've found, which gives the nod to the A9: [...]HEADS UPThe \"HP Slate 8 Pro\" is a 4:3 tablet coming in Fall 2013, with a Retina-quality display. This will be the perfect device in my opinion, and you may want to wait and check it out. However it will surely be significantly more expensive.UPDATE 12/2/2013: The HP Slate 8 Pro is now available, and is almost exactly double the price of the Acer. HP Slate S 8-7600US 8-Inch 16 GB Tablet (Soft White) Is the higher-resolution screen and other hardware specs worth the difference? Perhaps to you, but for me: not even close.RANTWhy the heck don't more Android tablet-makers use 4:3??!!

I can't believe this tablet is only $169... Does not make sense to me. I think they are under-pricing it big time.

All apps seem to work just fine. Wifi works great and does not drop. I watch tons of Netflix and it works great. Internet Browser works great (I downloaded Firefox). Yes, there is an easy way to sideload Flash. Screen looks great. Kindle app works great. Hulu plus shows videos flawlessly.I bought a Bluetooth speaker here on Amazon (the Anker 4.0 for $30). You will need an external speaker, because the Acer tablet speaker is perhaps the worst speaker on any tablet ever made.

A number of people at the Acer community site have complained of the low sensitivity. Apparently an update a few months ago fixed it for some users, and not others. Mine is at the newer version, so I doubt there will be a patch. When dragging items with my finger or long-tapping, very, very often the device thinks I have let my finger up, and drops something in the wrong place or opens a document I was trying to select.Also, the screen doesn't brighten and dim automatically based on ambient light like the Nexus, but this might be a setup option I can't find. However, even at it's brightest setting it's a bit dim for a brightly lit room, and nearly unusable outdoors.The sound from the speaker is very poor. Not enough volume for listening to podcasts if there is any ambient noise.With the Nexus I downloaded from an OpenSSH server on my wireless LAN at 20Mb/s; this can never manage over 16Mb/s.

It looks expensive and materials are good quality, screen seems to be against scratches.CONS:- Poor speaker volume, it is mono by the way, not sure why they did not make it stereo.- Screen brightness could be improved, it does have good brightness, but at the time you adjust it to the lowest the screen is still to bright, the other tablets could adjust brightness better, I lower it all the way to read books in the night.Overall, I give it 5 start for its price and performance.

This was a great little tablet, with fast and trouble free operation. The screen size is noticeably better than the typical 7 inch, and the picture is beautiful. I had no complaints and would even have purchased more, if I didn't know a cracked digitizer would cost more to fix than purchasing an entirely new tablet. The digitizer is the touch screen that sits in front of the LCD screen. They typically cost just a small fraction of what en entire LCD screen would, because it's just the touch sensitive glass in front of the actual display. So I tried to set up a repair, thinking it couldn't cost as much as a brand new tablet, WRONG!!!!I set up a work order, and here's what they sent back to my email:Dear Mr...We have received your request for repair, but unfortunately we\u2019re unable to complete your request because physical damage is not covered under the standard manufacturer\u2019s warranty. Our standard repair charge for this repair is $249.00 plus local taxes. Please contact technical support by telephone at 1-800-816-2237 for assistance in setting up an out of warranty repair.Note: this email address is not monitored; therefore an Acer Service agent will not be able to respond to your email request. In the event you need support assistance for your Acer product, please contact Support at one of our Web sites below or call the Support number in your documentation.[...] for Acer productsThank you,Acer Service Corp.Now if I was stupid, I would have it repaired, although it seems this is what they are banking on when you consider buying one of their products. I'm considering replacing the digitizer my self, but they cost around $80 to replace, and it voids the original warranty. So now I have a device that is less than 3 months old, with a cracked screen, and no warranty.

Because I love technology and computer hardware so much, I decided that this tablet is the best bang for your buck tablet you could possibly get. My mother bought this for $179.00 online and it has made her life so much easier. The processor is blazing-fast, Android runs smooth as butter, the 1gb ram surprisingly does not slow down the tablet at all. After showing her how to use chrome, youtube, and google maps, my mother can now do so many things she couldn't do before. She watches all her shows on it, and also plugs it into the tv with the mini-hdmi output, looks up directions to places, checks her email, and can google various things to her liking now.Pros:Quad-Core Processor (oh yeah!)Android 4.1-4.2 Jelly Bean (for the gameboy emulators)Mini-HDMI OutputMicro-SD Card SupportCons:Both cameras are, in my opinion, terrible. If you're buying this for the cameras, you're not buying it for the right reasonMini-HDMi isn't as crystal clear as you'd think and seems a bit washed out.The instruction manual said it would have an optional SIM card slot that has, to my recollection, not have been released yet (a model of this with a sim card slot). If it had that this would be poppin!My mother struggled for years with learning technology. She could never get the hang of computers, even though I tried to teach her for years. She had an old iphone a few years back and got used to that, but then she gave it to my brother so she may have forgotten how to use it over the years. With advancing technology, now she doesn't have to. She uses it everyday and it keeps her entertained. It's helping her use her blackberry now too, just today she pulled out her phone and took a picture and I was shocked because I never taught her how to do that, I only installed a flashlight app on her phone. She's now also excited to get the new iPhone, which makes me excited to know that my mother will not one day reject technology when she's old like many old people do. And I know this isn't the best one out there, but for the price vs content/functionality, this is by far the best \"bang for your buck\" tablet-PC on the market at this time, and I would definitely recommend it (expect for people who truly want to use the camera)", "Title": "Great for my mom", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R2HFVII1LSPLP2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say that I was surprise at the Acer Iconia A1-810 tablet.

I am very impressed with the speed and how easy it was to integrate with my Google Accounts.  I use for both work and play and so far I have no had any issues with downloading, looking at documents (through Google Drive and/or Kindle).  Very easy to personalize.  You can add a microSD card for more storage space though without you'll still have plenty of room. The camera is so-so at 5 mps but it's much better than the iPad/iPad Mini quality I've seen and who really takes photos with their tablet?  In a pinch it works great.  Easy to add my Kindle books to it plus you have the option of using Google Play books.  Typing is easy though for heavy duty work I'd suggest a keypad.  I only wish, just like my Android phone, I could remove some of the programs I'm not going to use.  I don't need Google Play Music, Amazon MP3, 7Digitial and Zinio for instance.  I use G Play Music and Amazon and really could survive with just one of them if I had too.The weight of this tablet is slightly more than the iPad mini.  The price difference is over $200+ dollars.  I think I'd rather carry around something slightly heavier than pay the extra money.  The screen is clear with rich colors though I have found I really need to turn down the brightness though I've since purchased a screen protector that seems to have helped that.  Sound is meh...it's a tablet...with headphones or a portable speaker the sound is perfect.  Streaming tv/movies is easy with no lag time.Battery life is amazing.  I've gone 8 hours + on a single charge.  Streaming does cut that down but I still only charge at night (and have skipped a day when I've only read email and surfed the web and read a book on the Kindle app).All and all it is an excellent tablet for an excellent price.

I have been surfing and reading on a smart phone every day and finally decided to save my eyes and get a tablet. Glad I did that. I read all reviews posted on Amazon for the Acer Iconia and also found out that Consumer Reports recommends this tablet ...not as highly as the IPad or Samsung tablet but it is in the top ten. Also, the Acer costs less and fits my budget . I discovered that your tablet's  processor is very important and Acer has a very powerful processor. I'd like to address some of the other reviewer's complaints. To me the screen is bright and clear. The speakers are loud enough for me but, if I need them, I can use earphones or buds. I did not expect powerful speakers and these work for me. I have had no problems with the touch screen. It is equal to my Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone in sensitivity. The only complaint I have is that the Facebook App does not show pictures and I must sign in through the browser to see FB. I like Android and the tablet came fully charged.

I see a lot of reviews saying that 7 inch is the best size, because you can use it with one hand and put it in your pocket.

As long as I will be using two hands and carrying this in my purse, I care about readability and available apps, and I don't want to spend a bunch of time figuring out how to set the thing up . What can I say? The display is very easy to read, the interface is intuitive, and it has played very nice with the Google Play store.The only thing I am sad about is the price has dropped $9 since I bought it a few days ago. I am going to see if my credit card company offers some sort of price guarantee protection. Some of them do.I am not having any problems with the touchscreen or video/sound quality as some had mentioned. I would not normally listen to this without headphones. It would be rude to do so in public anyway, and it has a standard headphone connection and sounds just fine through headphones.I could probably find a tablet that was faster, but it's plenty fast enough for me. I could also find one with a longer battery life but this hasn't run out on me when I needed it. And I could probably find one with better cameras but I already have an iPhone and just use that.

From there we contacted them, and followed what we were pointed to do so it would be fixed but soon as we sent in the PROOF OF PURCHASE they pointed us to download on here and email....well from that point we keep getting responses its not the proper paperwork. Be warned when you get products on here to look at your paperwork the product comes with, some reason ours only listed the item but no purchase date so its beyond me what to do to make this thing work like it should. Refurbished products are supposed to come to you working I hope way past a week but seems to me its more a pawn off of a horrible working item through the route we went. We are pretty fed up, when I call the warranty department they always tell us to send in the one thing that by email is being rejected and seems whoever is running that department has major miscommunication going on. Now I have to deal with the fact I bought this for my girlfriend, she is now gonna have to wait on us to either buy a whole other product or have this one fixed but personally after this experience I may stop using Amazon all together and definitely probably never touching an Acer product again. We aren't rich people here, we feel if you pay over a hundred bucks for something you pretty much should have more than a weeks time using it, but seems to me this warranty department is doing all it can to not make it right over doing something as common as making sure a customer is happy and wanted to warn anyone thinking about buying a refurbished product of this to be careful. Far as ours, it was not dropped....cord never was pulled out, nothing happened to it, just did not work all the sudden...not even loose so its beyond me what is going on. We probably will just throw it away and make sure when we avoid buying any future electronics offsite from Amazon, its pretty much set me off that much. Its a great tablet, don't get me wrong if you get a new one I am sure you will not get a headache like this one, our issue is the refurbished one. Sad cause we been saving up to get a macked out gaming pc on here but I think I am gonna take that purchase elsewhere cause I will use the pc for work in my recording studio and can't trust this warranty department if I have issues with that thing.
