I\u2019ve been using it ~ 1 month now and it's been very good.All the programs work, downloaded Apps (games programs, and maps are working). The Wi-Fi range is good, logged cleanly into my family secure WiFi setup. Got used to the White color. Very good sharp graphics. I'm on YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, etc.Haven't figured out all the shortcut and home screen buttons yet.
