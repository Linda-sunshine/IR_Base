{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "R1ETXDKFTELDXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got one of these for a friend, someone who I know isn't going to be picky about hardware specs and speed. There are a lot of entry-level Android tablets out there now, some of which are sub-$100 models. You can actually get this one in that price range if you find it on sale, but what sets it apart from a lot of others is it's actually not half bad.On that note, a word of warning- most if not all other tablets in this price range are little more than child's toys. They tend to have very weak hardware that can barely handle Angry Birds and will lag seriously if you try to stream video. Furthermore the build quality is shoddy- they use cheap plastic and glass that affords poor viewing angle, has bad glare in bright light, and is very easy to scratch or break.The main reason I even gave this consideration is it's made by Asus. I've used Asus hardware for a very long time- everything ranging from motherboards to graphics cards, monitors, laptops, routers, and most recently the Nexus 7. Generally speaking, their hardware is very solid in terms of performance and reliability. In fact I can't think of a single time I've been disappointed by one of their products. I figured even if this tablet was suspiciously cheap, it was probably at least decent. And it is.First, expectations. This is not an iPad and you aren't paying $500+ for it. If you expect it to perform like an iPad, you WILL be disappointed. It's also half the price of the similar-sized Nexus 7 and of course not as nice. But for what you pay for, it's surprisingly good. Particularly, it has these pro points:-- A lot of internal storage (16 GB), twice the Nexus 7 base model and as much as the Kindle Fire HD base model.-- It is an Android 4.1 Jellybean tablet. Most tablets in this price range are 2.3 or 4.0-- It has a micro-SD slot, which is very noteworthy. Many significantly more expensive tablets, including the Nexus 7, do not have one (the cheapest decent one I know of is the Galaxy Tab 2 7, which is about $70 more).-- Pretty decent hardware and chipset- it's comparable to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7. I at first thought the VIA chipset would be considerably slower, but it's actually so similar as makes no difference. It's robust enough to run some pretty heavyweight apps, and can stream HD flawlessly.-- Light weight, solid build. The tablet has a rubberized back that feels rugged and affords good grip. It is about the same size and weight as the Nexus 7.-- Good battery life. It lasts about as long as its more expensive cousins, especially if you don't use 'performance mode.'-- Comes with an AC adapter. Might not seem a plus, but these days a lot of electronics don't include one, which can be a pain.I suspect a lot of the complaints I've seen about apps and performance have to do with teething bugs. When a new device is released, this is pretty normal- a few updates usually fixes it. I've seen little in the way of these problems so far. That said, there are of course some downsides to this tablet:-- The display is average at best. Touch controls work fine, resolution is not bad, but the viewing angle is very noticeably more narrow than a lot of higher priced tablets (not terribad though, like the Dell Streak 7). It also seems to suffer more from glare, possibly because the backlight doesn't seem to be that powerful even on full brightness. It's by no means unworkable but if you're not looking straight at the screen or if you're viewing it in bright light, it's harder to make out detail.-- As with the Nexus 7, the speaker (note singular) on this tablet is pretty mediocre. You'll want headphones if you listen to music or stream videos. It works fine for things like Skype though.-- Ditto with the camera, which is essentially just a webcam. Unlike the pretty decent cameras on the Galaxy Tab 2, you're definitely not going to be using this to take pictures.-- No bluetooth. This is probably the biggest minus as far as feature set goes, and though the virtual keyboard is well done, it's still not great for things like email. This also means there's no wireless file transfer, though the SD slot and cloud storage mitigates that.-- Some apps are apparently still incompatible at this writing, notably Instagram 4.0 (however, I was able to sideload 3.5). I don't expect this to remain an issue for long.Overall, I would say this is a solid tablet considering what you're paying for it. I will also note though that you can 'fix' pretty much all of those cons by paying $60-70 more for a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Still, for a device that you can get for as low as $80 on sale, this is a surprisingly good performer. It's practical, inexpensive enough to gift, and doesn't cost so much that you'll be scared to use it.Edit: 8/9/2013- just to add a few extra points in the MeMO Pad's favor:-- This thing actually supports USB on the go. I was frankly amazed by this since a lot of much more expensive tablets and phones do not (including the KFHD). I've tried flash drives and a voice recorder; both work perfectly (you'll probably need a 3rd party cable for this).-- The battery life on standby is pretty good. I've let it sit for 2 weeks with minimal use (wifi and sync on) and it still has about 1/4 charge. Not bad.I've noticed that the 1st gen Nexus 7 has received a massive price drop (probably due to the release of the 2nd gen) that makes it much more competitive. The MeMO pad is definitely still the choice if you're on a budget though.", "Title": "Surprisingly decent budget tablet", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R3F1W49558MK5J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this to replace an older outdated tablet that i planned on giving to my 6 yr old. At first glance this tablet seemed amazing for the price, then i used it on a regular basis. I will start out with the good. The screen is responsive and works well, the battery life is ok if you set the WiFi as off when standby, and the apps that are downloadable work well. The internet and chrome seem to also work well for a tablet of this price. Now for the bad. I found that alot of the apps i like are not compatible with this model/tablet for some reason? There is no bluetooth, and the front only facing camera is horrible. Netflix does not work unless you ok with the audio and video being off by .25-.50 second. VuDu, Wikipedia, Netflix, Gamefly, and a few other apps are not even available from the play store due to \"not compatible\". I have had this for 1 week and decided to return it and spend the extra $50 for a Nexus 7 or a Samsung tablet.Pros-good screen and touch response, works well for some apps/games and for minor internet use.

They sold their DS and games for $300 so we were on the hunt for 2 tablets we could buy with that money. We were looking for a 7\" Android tablet made by a reputable manufacturer, that came with a current version of Android installed and had expandable storage via a micro SD card slot.This tablet had all of those things. I read several reviews that complained about the graphics and processor speeds. I bought these tablets despite the negative reviews and I'm glad I did because honestly I personally haven't experienced anything they were talking about. I'm not having any of those issues. My kids get partially paid for chores in Google Play gift cards and download TV shows, books, music, games and apps from the Google Play/Android store. They use the tablets to watch Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime on their tablets and the media looks great. It's not grainy or choppy and these little things have some killer speakers on them. Also if this tablet is for your kids, the parental controls are easy to set up.I looked at a lot of other tablets like the Google Nexus (made by Asus) but it was twice the price and didn't have a micro SD slot. Then I considered the Samsung Galaxy Tab which DID have a micro SD slot but was twice the price, had an older OS and had been on the market for 2 years.Bottom line... for $89 these were a super buy! We have not had any issues with them whatsoever. If you are a college student or an adult I could understand how you would want/need a bigger, better, faster tablet. However if you're looking for something to give to your 10 to 17 year old, it's perfect! The biggest selling point for me was...  at $89 my kids were able to buy them with their own money. That has made them feel a lot more responsible for the devices. Worst case scenario, if they lose it or destroy it, they won't lose any data because everything syncs to their Google account and they can afford to replace it themselves.", "Title": "What's not to like?

I didn't want a iPad because I have a iPhone and I didn't want to pay more than 150ish for the tablet.  I considered getting the Nexus 7 but I couldn't justify spending 200 on something I will only probably use for a few months and then put away somewhere.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to go with this tablet because A. Asus makes the Nexus 7 and B. It looked basic enough for me to get what I want out of it.  I basically wanted a watered down Nexus 7.When I first received it, I set it up right out of the box and noticed it was running really choppy and slow.  I figured it was because it needed to be charged fully and restarted.  After doing that a few times the performance did not improve.  I was THIS close to just sending it back and getting the Nexus but I decided to reset it and try again; I'm glad I did.  It works MUCH better! Most of the apps I use on my iPhone and other tablet I was able to get on it.  It's fast and pretty responsive.I do have a few complaints:*Not all apps are compatibly with it (I downloaded the apps that weren't off the internet and they work just fine now)**Camera is \"meh\" (I'm not one of those that takes pictures with their tablets but the iPhone front camera is still the best by far!)*No bluetooth (I did the research so I already knew before I bought it. Still lame though)*Screen quality is a 6.8 out of 10.

I usually connect to the 'Net once or twice a day from home, and I feel that I miss a lot that way.As for the tablet itself, the startup time is a little slow (at least ten seconds). And as someone else said, there's no knowing when it's fully charged, you have to turn it on to see that. But that's a minor issue. I've also tested the camera and I agree that a rear one would be better, but I'm okay with it. Unfortunately though, I've owned it for two days and it's already crashed once, but I expected that. (saw that in other reviews) And file backup is recommended just as with any other computer, so I'm not going to store important files on it because you may lose them, and any apps that you've installed may go back to their original settings, when the tablet is rebooted/restarted. Also, check the tablet's startup/standby settings because it may autolock when you turn it off then turn it back on again. That's all I can remember right now.But so far the issues are minor because I'm going to use this tablet mainly to go on the 'Net and check emails. I don't foresee installing any apps or games, but I might add an SDHC card because I will download and then transfer files between this tablet and my old desktop computer (trying to get an Android simulator to do that).Overall, this is good for what it can do, and for what I need.Update 6/29: Took it to a public Wi-Fi spot. Worked great, ran smooth, no problems. Another reason to keep it.Update 7/19: I shouldn't make predictions! Of COURSE I've added a few apps and games, and a few \"live\" wallpapers too. All with no problems. And the tablet has automatically downloaded some upgrades (oops, don't want them to be automatic), I don't know if that's why it hasn't crashed for a good long while now. I also got a USB 2.0 A to Micro B Female / Male Adaptor, so I can use USB \"sticks\" with it. And oh yeah, the battery's good for at least three hours while I'm, uh, WiFi-ing. Still going to keep it.Update 7/23: PHEW...My bagstrap suddenly broke last night, the bag fell a few feet to tile floor...fortunately the bag was full of stuff so the tablet was ''padded''. And I'm using it now, so give it a point for toughness.Update 8/16: I got a mini-memory card stuck in the slot. Yikes. Couldn't get it out. Didn't call customer service because that's not covered in the warranty and I wanted same-day service, I didn't want to mail it or take the long trip to the closest authorized repair place. Found a closer place that charged a reasonable price. And since I can use regular USB drives with the Memopad (via the adapter) I'm not sure if I want to get another mini-sdhc card.Update Nov. 15: One of my worst fears: The screen got stratched. But not too badly. Very likely would have to pay for replacement so not going to bother right now.Update Jan 22 2014: It rebooted instead of unmounting an external usb drive. Not good. Will use the new charging/data transfer cable I bought to get files to and from this and other computers. May have to reset it again, this would be the third time. Gah.Update April 2014: It froze while transferring to a USB drive via the adapter. Maybe it doesn't like the drive or adapter, or maybe it was cranky, or...whatever. It's ok now.

I was looking for a tablet that I could use for my basic needs that don't really require my ASUS EeePC heating up my lap. I preferred to stick with the brand and not get an off brand at Big Lots. I like it so far. This is my first tablet. It seems perfect for a student that doesn't demand serious gaming, or a super crisp text. I read books just fine with it and prefer it. It doesn't have bluetooth, GPS, or a camera on the back, but I don't have that on my netbook either and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. The response is good. The ASUS pre-installed apps are nice, I wish I could get rid of some of the Google Apps that are pre-installed. Rooting instructions are not available on the internet yet, so I will have to wait for that. Anyhow, I would recommend this to anyone that likes to read, surf, play games that aren't resource hogs, and just wants to organize their electronic life on a handheld. I read a lot of reviews before getting this on different websites, and I think the people reviewing this was a bit bias. There is definitely a niche for this product. It is a quality product. If you don't need all the extras, but want a brand that will stand behind it's products, consider the ASUS MeMo Pad. If you want something high-falutin' look elsewhere.

It was primarily to be used for skype and some light news reading maybe some video watching. The 1MP camera that could do 720p for video calls seemed perfect and the single core processor should have been enough to handle video. Well that wasn't the case, the video was terrible - the resolution never went up from 320x240 - this is 2013 and I kind of expect more. I easily get 720p through my desktop computer, so it's not the network connection or anything like that. Then there was the microphone - the people on the other end said they could barely hear me, so I figured OK, it just needs an external microphone, no big deal - pluggied in my iPhone headphones and voila, they could hear me perfectly again. This wasn't the dealbreaker here, as it would have still provided basic functionality, but then I tried Netflix...It stuttered and spewed at NON-HD videos, I don't think it even gave me the option of using HD, afterwards I read that other people had been having the same problems. Oh and to add to the mix was that the videos were extremely silent on MAX volume settings, also the speaker is located on the back of the tablet, my little iPhone blows this thing out of the water with it's stereo speakers that are on the bottom. I left it to charge since it was charging very slowly, the next day I started using it again and it seemed like the battery went down really really fast, so I put it to charge again. After a couple of hours I checked on it and it said it was charged completely. Then I started using it again playing around with features and it was maybe drained to 62%, so I just left it in standby mode. After a couple of hours I tried using it again, but this time the tablet didn't react, it was like it's off. So I tried holding the button for a long time, but to no avail. Then I tried plugging it in and after maybe 5 minutes I tried pushing the button again, this time it worked, but it's like the tablet was off - the battery showed something like 50% and it was charging again. When it reached 70+%  I tried unplugging it and using it - all was well. But then again, it seemed like the battery didn't charge or didn't realize that it had a charge - so it went in OFF mode again and again. So yeah this is the dealbreaker, returned.

I am very happy with my purchase.As a side note, when it arrived, my husband and I opened it to check it out and pre-load some apps on it. When it turned on, it said that an update was available. My husband has a Nexus 7 and had installed this update on his, when prompted, a week or so earlier and it bricked his tablet. He did some research and that was a known issue with that particular update. He was able to fix his after some frustration. Thinking ahead, we made a backup of the ASUS before we installed the update, and just as we expected, it bricked it. Since he had already dealt with this and we had made a backup, it was no problem to get it working again. So be aware that there's a risk with installing the update it will probably prompt you to install. Make a backup and do some reading online first though, and it shouldn't be too big of a problem.

This tablet is not particularly powerful, so I found myself having to restrict what I wanted to do with it. This is not a gaming tablet, and cannot handle most gaming applications. It is in the most essential of ways, a general use tablet.Pros: - This tablet has the phone shaped design for a 7\" screen, making it somewhat easier to hold than an 8.9\" or 10\" tablet. - It comes with the Play store unlike most tablets in this price range. - For the price range, this tablet performs well enough to be a solid pick amongst the other entry level tablets.Cons: - It is an entry level tablet. Long boot times and general lag in the performance - The tablet will freeze from time to time in loading applications and waking up from sleep. - Tablet shuts off at random times for no reason. - There are no drivers to connect the tablet to the PCOverall:  This is a very good entry level tablet, but if you are a power user or are looking to play games with a tablet, you may need to look elsewhere as this tablet will not deliver a good gaming experience.

I like simple reviews, so I've made this as concise as possible.Pros:- 1024X600 Display. While it isn't as fancy as the iPad or the Nexus, the display is more than enough for daily use. Can I discern the pixels? Yes, but any text bigger than 6pt font is clear and Netflix quality is more than acceptable.- Battery life. The MeMO Pad has 3 settings for battery; saver, balanced, and performance. To test its lifespan I played \"The Dark Knight\" from beginning to end at 75% brightness on balanced mode with headphones in. The movie is 2.5 hours long, and when it was over the battery was at 56%. This means you can watch about 6 hours of video before needing to recharge.- Processing speed. No problem playing \"Plants vs. Zombies 2\". 1 GB of RAM seems to do nicely for whatever apps I am using. There is a 1 second lag when rotating the screen, but no major problems.- Micro-SD slot. From my own research, this is noteworthy. While the 16 GB internal storage is great (that's about 7 standard definition movies, a few hundred pictures, plus a whole bunch of apps), if that isn't enough then you can triple your space with a 32 GB micro-SD card.- Full access to Google Play Store. Need I say more?- Runs on Android 4.1 OS. My last phone had the 2.3 version. After only a few minutes I could see the difference in performance. 4.1 is a lot faster, more user-friendly, and makes for a more enjoyable tablet experience.Cons:- No outward-facing camera. I don't expect or even want this to act as a digital camera, but I know this could be a deal-breaker for some people.- Touchscreen keyboard. I have fairly large hands being almost 7' tall, so I can't imagine how regular people feel using the sideways keyboard. Vertically, it isn't too bad, although the weight distribution feels off. Some of the keys are in odd places too, like the period and enter keys. Not the worst thing in the world but not as comfortable as preferred.- Speaker quality. This tablet is designed with headphones in mind. The EQ software does a good job but the single internal speaker isn't meant for anything more than system noises. It isn't terrible though, and given how cheap this tablet is, this is probably to be expected.- No Amazon Instant Video. I get that Adobe Flash player is no longer compatible with newer Android tablets, but come on! Half of the reason I love Amazon Prime is to watch Prime videos. Netflix and Vudu are compatible, but Prime has some titles unavailable on either.Final Verdict:I really like this tablet. High marks for battery life, display, and processing power. While the lack of an outward-facing camera and the quality of the speakers make it fall short of its more expensive competition, I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants a tablet for traveling or to use at work.", "Title": "Great Value as a Starter Tablet", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "Ann-Marie Griffeth", "ReviewID": "R30VMLS5RD2JLY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have all three colors on this tablet were purchased as a gift to my kids, I don't know if the pink one I got had a weak screen or some thing else but the other two have taken a beating form my 2 and 3  year old and nothing has happened to them.

I read many of the reviews before purchasing, and was a little hesitant; I have bought a few off brand tablets on price and been disappointed in their speed, and compatibility with many apps. This unit works great in comparisons to those. I only had one app with compatibility issue, and the speed is good for a budget tablet. I think some people are expecting high end tablet speeds and display quality from this unit. I was able to purchase my tablet for $90, for that cost it has performed better than any other budget tablet I have owned! I would have paid up to $130 for this type/quality of tablet. The Asus performed well with all the apps I testing on it. Only one had compatibility issues (media PlayerPro). The tablet does lag at times when running multiple apps, and requires a reboot every now and then. But I have come to expect this and even worse lags from all budget tablets, I highly recommend this one and it is worth the slight extra cost. Battery life is a little low, with constant use you will probably only get about 3-4 hours out of it, it will easily last a day with standard use.  I let my kids use this one, they are not as concerned with quality and speed, and can stay tethered to a computer or power outlet when playing for extended periods of time..", "Title": "Great budget tablet, Works as expected.

The 1064 x 600 screen is great at the close viewing length when you hold in your hand at arms length. You won't have issues with the sharpness and clarity. If you are picky about clarity then you need to spend $299 and get 1900 x 1200 or better.Also think about it.

Might return it just on the basis of misrepresentation.", "Title": "Stoked!

I currently have a 10\" Acer that I love, but wanted something smaller.  Expected ASUS to provide an adequate 7\" tablet just to do common web based apps like browsing, Facebook, radio and video apps.  It cannot handle any of this.  Browsing is painfully slow (found Opera Mini to be the best option) as Chrome and other full featured browsers hang. Videos start and stop, or just hang completely forcing a restart of app or a complete reboot of the tablet. If performance mode is selected (it does not make much difference) be prepared for laptop type battery life.  Where the Acer will go days without a charge, this goes hours, to maybe a day of on and off use. I guess if I considered the low cost of this tablet, I should have set my expectations a lot lower.  It is a good reader so based on that and low cost, I gave it an OK.I need to update my review of this tablet (3/9/14)to bump it up two stars! My biggest concern after I bought it was the horrible battery life and slow network speed. In January the battery died completely and would not accept a charge at all.  Asus honored their warranty and repaired the device in a timely manner with no hassle.  All I can say is WOW; night and day difference in battery life, wireless power and network speed.  I am very pleased with the device now as it can easily go three days (on and off use) without a charge.  It's fast and no longer has issues with video or browsers hanging up. I think I may even like it better than the Acer :-)", "Title": "Barely Usable", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "tornike kipiani", "ReviewID": "R2YRIXNX4AVU7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i both these moth a go it work just perfect, you get what you pay for ! even more .it's great it's cheap ! ! love it !", "Title": "asus memo pad i like it a lot!", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "T.

It looked perfectly fine, but something inside got cracked or disconnected, because now the screen is just colors and lines.ASUS customer service is friendly in that disinterested, unhelpful way of most technical service these days. Apparently that repair is not covered under the warranty, even though while they had me on hold the hold message said that the warranty covered one case of accidental damage per machine. This was never quite explained, but whatever: so I ask for an estimate of how much it will cost to get it repaired. The estimate they gave me was $180 (not including shipping). Note that this is a $100 tablet. I was stunned that anyone could even utter such a thing without feeling stupid.I'm going to see if there's any other way to repair it, but I can say that I will not be buying an ASUS product again.
