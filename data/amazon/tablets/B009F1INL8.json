{"Reviews": [{"Author": "LA Gadget Dude", "ReviewID": "R2TDD2YEMQ89PS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet has been bashed by most tech journalists and I'm not sure why. To me it seems that many tech journalists have become Apple fanatics. I am tech agnostic and own products from all manufacturers: A Mac mini, a Macbook Pro 13.3, a Galaxy Note phone, and a bunch of tablets (ipad 3, Kindle Fire HD, Galaxy Note 10.1). I must say that this tablet has completely taken me off guard. I really wasn't expecting to like it all that much, but this tablet is a great alternative to the iOS and Android tablets.My first Windows 8 tablet was a Samsung Ativ Smart PC (XE-500T). It's an overall excellent device, but has a few fatal flaws: 1) A plastic back is a very bad choice for a 11.6\" device and the tablet has way too much flex (mine produced creaking noises) 2) Intel has come a long way with Atom processors, but overall performance was a bit laggy. 3) The Ativ at 11.6\" was just a bit too thick and a bit too large to qualify as portable.Anyways, back to the review of the Vivo Tab:1. Build quality- The Asus feels solid. Fit and finish is superb and it feels like a premium device. I'm guessing that the tech journalists who have reviewed this device to date received preproduction versions. Bottom line is that build quality should please any iOS fan and is a nice step up even from premium Android devices such as the Galaxy Note 10.12. Screen - Very nice. Better than an iPad 2 and almost as nice as an iPad 3. The screen has a particular color tone to it, but that's usually the case with most screens.3. Performance - I was very skeptical about Windows 8 performance on a tablet. Windows devices have been so guilty of having rockstar specs on paper, but have never performed to their full potential in the real world. I'm shocked as to how fluid the overall performance is. It seems to be on par with an iPad 3, possibly better. I haven't experienced any lag or lockups so far.4. Windows RT - Again, I have no idea why people are bashing the RT version of Windows. RT is exactly what I want. Why the heck would anyone want to run a Windows desktop app on a tablet? Isn't this the reason why Apple and Android have eaten Microsoft's lunch over the past few years? The RT UI is refreshing. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a a very slim selection of apps at the moment (e.g. Google Video Chat won't work since the Windows RT version of Internet Explorer doesn't support plugins and there is no dedicated Google Video Chat app yet). The lack of apps is definitely a shortcoming, but very likely a short term issue. I seriously doubt that developers will ignore Windows RT tablets like they have the BB Playbook.5. Battery life - I can't comment on this, but with the free dock the Vivo Tab is rumored to go for 16 hrs. No other manufacturer that I know of can touch that.6. Business vs. Personal use - The reason I was looking for a new tablet is that I haven't found one that is ideal for both personal and business use. Windows / Windows Server / MS Office is pretty much the standard at most companies and I've always had to figure out work arounds with my iOS and Android tablets. I'm hoping that I've finally found the tablet that will work for both home and work use. For example, right out of the box, this tablet supports mutiple logins. This means that I can have a separate login for my work, my personal stuff, and one for my 2 year old as well.So far, I give the Asus a 4 out of 5 stars. I am still becoming accustomed to the Windows 8 interface, but I really like it so far. The biggest problem I am having is that my company uses Google Apps and I can't figure out how to setup a Windows 8 login account using my company e-mail address.FREE KEYBOARD DOCK !!!:The keyboard dock on this device is free until 12/31/12. Go to the Asus USA site and you'll find out all of the details. You basically have to register as a Asus VIP member and send in the original box serial number to get the free keyboard. This is a $170 freebie. Way to go Asus !!!", "Title": "Don't Forget to Get the Free Keyboard (See end of review)", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tim Yenmor \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "RRQRLFCSY7H09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, there's already been enough positive reviews that cite the strengths of this tablet.  And with the 5 stars I am giving this tablet, you can guess that I am happy with this tablet.  So, this review is more a response to people's criticisms of the tablet.Before I continue, here is a list of tablets that I have owned.  This list is to show that I know what to look for in a tablet.Ipads 1 and 2Acer IconiaViewsonic GtabletSamsung Galaxy tab 1 and 2Augen GentouchAmazon FireAsus TF101, SL101, TF201, TF700T, and TF600TSo, as you can see I am well aware of what to look for in a tablet.  I have not touched my laptop for nearly two years because the TF700 has fulfilled my work needs while on the go.  I bought the TF600 (vivotab rt) with the intention of replacing my TF700.So, here are some complaints that I've seen about the vivotab and why I think the complaints are not legit.(1) Keyboard is too small to type.Of all the complaints about this tablet, I think this is the most bogus.  Yes, it is small, but if you can't type on anything that is slightly smaller than the full size desktop keyboard, then don't get a 10 inch device.  The keyboard is 97% the size of a full size keyboard, so it's not that much smaller.  I am typing full speed on this keyboard, and I have fairly large hands.  I've not noticed any discomfort at all.  If you find yourself unable to type full speed with a keyboard it that is 97% the size of a regular keyboard, then just get a full size laptop.(2) The trackpad is too sensitive, making it too easy to accidentally touch and change the place of the typing cursor.It took me a whole 5 seconds (if that) to find a way to disable the trackpad.  Hint: fn+f9.(3) The screen is not HD enough.First of all, this is a full HD screen.  It's not as high def as the asus infinity or the ipad 3, but it is plenty clear.  You will only notice a difference between this screen and the infinity or the ipad 3 if you put your face up against the screen and try to look for the pixels.  The screen is more than capable to play 1080p movies.(4) Windows rt does not have enough apps.As it stands, windows rt has about 5,000 apps.  When iOS first launched, apple's appstore had 0 apps.  When Android first launched, it had 700 apps.  Windows rt launched with 5,000 apps.As you go through the apps, you will notice that many of the apps (games) you love are not on the windows rt app store.  I agree that this is a drawback.  More on this at the end of this review.(5) Windows rt interface is too hard to adapt to.I don't understand what's so hard about the UI in windows 8/rt?  Swipe from the right to get options like search, menu, control, start, etc.  Swipe from the left to get the previous app or to dock the previous app and get split screen.  Swipe from the bottom or top to get app specific menu and options.  That's it.  For me, there was no learning curve at all.  And I'm a civil engineer, not some tech wiz.(6) Speakers are in the back.Where else would they be?  This is a very thin device.  Thinner than any ipad.  Thinner than anything else on the market.  If you have a device this thin, the speakers would either be in the front or the back.  The front is out of the question.  There's nothing there but glass.  For those complaining about this, you should get an ipad.  Oh wait, the ipad's speaker (singular, no stereo) is in the back as well.  If you think you can come up with a better design, why don't you build us the perfect tablet with better positioned speakers?(7) The device feels cheap.How?  The casing is made of brushed aluminum.  The whole tablet is one piece of aluminum connected to rubberized plastic and glass.  How is this cheap?  To me, it looks and feels very solid and very well designed and assembled.  It also is the thinnest device on the market.  How is this cheap?(8) The plastic strip is too big and has no purpose.Yes, the rubberized plastic strip on top of the back of the device has a purpose.  Asus redesigned the docking clams to make it possible for us to undock the tablet while the netbook form is still closed.  You couldn't do this in any other transformer series device.  The rubberized plastic strip is there to make it easier for us to reach into our bag and just undock and pull out the tablet.  To me, this redesign is godsend.  For my job, I travel a lot and use my tablet to write up reports.  I have to regularly pull out my tablet to pull up a digitized document or manual to survey the area job sites.  If you don't like how it looked, just buy a skinomi techskin and put it over the back of your tablet.************************************************************************************Now, here are some strengths that I've found about the tablet compared to the previous model the TF700.  The whole setup feels a lot more solid.  I can't really describe it well in words.  You just have to put your hands on one to know what I mean.  Asus engineers have also solved the balancing issue.  In the TF101, TF201, Tf300, and TF700, the netbook form had a balancing issue.  The tablet portion was a bit heavier than the docking station so that if you put a little pressure on the screen the whole setup would fall backward.  I'm sure you've seen this in video reviews of previous models.In the TF600, asus engineers have redistributed the weights toward the joints in the middle making the whole netbook form a lot more stable.  You can now push all you want on the screen and it would not fall backward.  In fact, you could hold the setup up to 45 degrees backward and release and the tablet would still fall forward and stand straight up.Now, going back to the windows rt weakness, which is the number of apps.  Yes, I agree that there are only 5,000 apps right now versus 700,000+ apps in the android market.  Think about the following.(1) How many apps do you have installed on your current device?  Do you have 5,000 apps installed?(2) Have you ever been taught that quality is more valuable than quantity?The windows 8/rt is a new ecosystem.  It will undoubtedly get more apps just like how android started out with 700 apps and now there are hundreds of thousands of apps.  But here's the thing.  Both the iOS and android ecosystems are now supersaturated with crap apps.  It really amazes me how many useless apps there are in there.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  I'm saying just looking at the numbers alone is deceptive.Windows RT is a full operating system.  It is the smoothest and best experience you will ever have on a tablet UI.  Compared to the ipad and the TF700, the vivotab rt feels so much faster and much more satisfying.  When you do a swipe with your finger on the ipad and the asus infinity, there is always a slight delay that everyone's gotten used to.  The vivotab rt, on the other hand, has no delay.  It is an amazing experience to see the screen following your finger with no delay at all.  You just have to play with one to feel the difference.  Don't take my word for it.  Go to the local best buy or staples and play around with the display unit.  You will see what I mean.After having used my new vivotab RT, I've been unable to go back to my asus infinity.  Even my ipad feels slow and sluggish compared to the vivotab RT.  Again, don't take my word for it.  Get your hands on these tablets and compare them for yourself.  You'll see what I mean.Don't worry about the number of apps and the app choices.  They are increasing by the minute.  I've already noticed a lot of app choices this week that I didn't see last month.  App developers are racing to put their apps in the Microsoft app store.In short, the iOS and android are built with only gaming experience in mind.  You'd be hard pressed to create and be productive with those OSes.  And most tech reviewers would agree with me on that.  Windows RT is made with both gaming and productivity in mind.  The split screen alone on the vivotab RT makes my job so much better than before.  And with battery life that lasts the whole day, I can go through the whole day without having to think about plugging in my device.For the doubters, just get your hands on one and try it out.  You won't regret it.  Trust me.", "Title": "Exceeded my expectations", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Author": "Corey M", "ReviewID": "R1XBPZKLZY913F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The moderate reviews this tablet has received from tech websites do not do it justice.  They say the downfall is it doesn't have that many apps.  Well, Apple released with 300, Android with 700, and this with 3,000.  Give it a few weeks and it will have everything you need.  Responsiveness, speed, load times, screen display, all of these things are great and I have no complaints.  I can use remote desktop to access terminals at work, which was previously impossible on iOS / Android.  Outlook allows all of my work emails to stream right in, and word / powerpoint / excel etc allow me to do my college projects and manage work documents from it.  It is not a COMPLETE desktop / laptop replacement, but it is as close to it is I have ever seen.  Ignore 3/5 reviews from CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget for not having \"the hundreds of thousands of apps from the competition\". Jeez, give it some time, it's brand new!Edit: By Outlook, I meant \"Mail\" on the start screen.  You can sync outlook accounts, yahoo, gmail, etc all into one hub.", "Title": "Better than I had hoped", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "A. Franco", "ReviewID": "R31E4IJS6E7OHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**3-mo update**Okay, so I've had this tablet for almost three months, and I must say that I have still do not have any regrets.  The app store is constantly being updated with new offerings, but is still far from what is available for the ipad and android tablets.  BUT with that said, there is a huge difference here...with the Windows RT OS, many of the apps you would need due to lack of flash support are availble simply by going to the website and having the full feature of the target website...hope that makes sense.  In short, I'm not missing anything that I used to have on the iPad2 or Nexus 7 I used to own.  Aside from the awesomeness that the keyboard dock offers in terms of battery life, the feature that has really worked well for my family is the ability to have individual user accounts.  We have three kids that are constantly on the Vivo Tab researching and typing their school work.  And just like a computer with multiple accounts, they can set the home screen to suit their individual needs and thier files are stored accordingly...no mix ups.  Pinting is a snap too...the Vivo Tab automatically detected our wireless printer...due to restrictions placed on their netbooks from their school, they cannot add our home printer.  So as you can imagine its been getting used ALOT.  The keyboard/battery dock is a crucial piece of this multi-tasking puzzle. With an average 13-hr battery life (our use) with keyboard, the one thing I heard the most from our kids was the relief of not having to worry about plugging the power supply in (mobility at its finest).  As for the rest, it has continued to meet my expectations.Original Post:Sooo happy we as consumers finally got something other than android or iOS. I won't hate on either, but I was more than ready for a solid third option. I will leave out the tech stuff since you can see that in the item description. Walked into the MS store earlier to purchase the Surface RT. Then I looked over and saw the Asus model. Love at first sight. Not only is the model lighter, but just feels right in the hands (Android Transformer users can attest). Loaded my music and movies...picture and sound quality is fantastic! Snapped a few photos with great results. Although I did not buy a tablet to snap photos or video. Screen clarity is just as good if not better than what I have seen with the various tablets I have owned prior to this (Galaxy Tabs, Nexus 7, iPad2). Swiping and the on screen keyboard are responsive...I have not noticed any hesitation or lag. Keep in mind we are dealing with a quad-core system. The only thing you will need to be aware of is the lack of apps in the store. But you also have to keep in mind that this is new to the MS ecosystem...they will come. Then there's office...AWESOME!!!. Added my corporate email and was opening and editing documents with ease...this is what sold me the most. Since I mostly work with documents, I will now be able to travel without my laptop. Overall, it was worth the wait...quality build, office, windows, happy camper.Forgot to mention. The tablet comes with a USB adapter so you can connect a USB flash drive to transfer files or get some work done. Also, as mentioned in the comments...Asus is offering the dock for FREE for a limited time. So if your thinking of getting one...", "Title": "simply awesome **3 Month Update**", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "MagnumMan", "ReviewID": "R30VSBTDX0V569", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let\u2019s face the ugly truth -- Windows 8 RT and the Surface series of tablets haven\u2019t exactly been a raging success.  Beaten back by Android and the more expensive but better liked iOS, Windows took a $900 million bath on unsold inventory and ditched the first version for the Surface 2.Unfortunately, RT\u2019s bad karma also rubbed off on other products, including this Asus VivoTab.  Originally $600 with a keyboard, the VivoTab was $100 less than the keyboardless Surface.  Today you can find a VivoTab for less than $400 and, in most cases, this includes a keyboard.Does the VivoTab live up to the expectations or is it destined to be a dud like the original Surface?Let\u2019s look at the basics and see if this puppy stacks up.In the Box:For this unit you\u2019ll get the tablet, keyboard, USB power cable with standard plug module, a cleaning cloth and a power connector pulling double duty as a secondary USB device.  Read below for more on that double-duty connector.Of course, you get instructions for both the tablet and keyboard.Design:Sensuous curves meet up with shades of black and gray to form an artist\u2019s dream -- as opposed to the Surface\u2019s rather stark suede like black material.  True, the VivoTab is still plastic with a little metal but it\u2019s nicely designed and laid out  plastic and metal.As for thickness or thinness, that is a toss up.  Some say the VivoTab is thinner while others state the Surface is, but in the end run does it really matter?  Get any thinner and they\u2019ll be invisible when turned sideways.Look around and you\u2019ll see the ubiquitous webcams front and rear but the one on the back is the biggie -- it\u2019s an 8 MP version which is about 3 or 4 MP higher than the standard (and nearly 4 times greater resolution than the original Surface). You\u2019ll also see the microSD slot, something you\u2019ll probably want since that 32GB SSD is already halfway gone just for the RT OS (oops, the ads curiously forget to mention that bit).  Of course you\u2019ve got the power connector/USB port on the bottom along with the necessary power and volume switches on the side.And what\u2019s that about a power connector acting as a USB port?  Well, the included keyboard does have a full USB port but the tablet portion doesn\u2019t, unlike the Surface which is reversed and has the port on the screen border.  Because of this design (necessary due to the VivoTab\u2019s thinner bezel) an adapter is used to convert the power port into a functional, full size USB receiver.Assembly:I added this area not because you have to build this thing but you do have to put the pieces together, mainly the keyboard and tablet.Unlike the Surface\u2019s magnet catch system, the VivoTab uses a push-to-lock and pull-to-release system.  Attaching the two pieces is akin to plugging a lamp into a socket.  While it\u2019s obvious the two pieces are mated once locked, it does lack the assurance of the Surface catch design with one of the strongest magnets I\u2019ve ever encountered.Releasing the pieces requires the movement of a slide switch on the left side of the tablet at which point you tug and they should come apart.  While they usually do, the process involves the awkward \u201cto the right\u201d still of tugging on the tablet to separate it from the keyboard.  Be careful to have your hands tightly on either piece since it isn\u2019t always a smooth experience.Boot:At 30 to 40 seconds for a cold boot from an SSD, one might think this is a slug but have you ever really looked at the boot time on an Android tablet?  Don\u2019t know about yours but my Nexus 7 takes 1.5 minutes on average.  Therefore, I\u2019ll call this category\u2019s rating as acceptable, especially since the Surface\u2019s I\u2019ve checked have roughly the same boot time.By the way, shut downs are jack quick, almost too much so.  If you accidentally push the power button you can count on the screen going out almost immediately.  Fortunately, a short push only puts it to sleep but I have hit the stupid thing at least a couple times just because of its odd placement in the upper right corner (just where anybody would naturally put their hand when grabbing it).Sleep, or standby mode, is a little less reliable with the unit either not waking up as it should or coming back on to a frozen screen.  From my experience with Windows 8 and RT, this could very well be a fault of the OS but I can\u2019t call it at this point.Post Boot Updating:This is a whopper so make sure you have a very, very good internet connection.  Notice the double use of very.Out of the box, this is what I had in the way of updates:  *  2.1 GB for Windows 8.1.  Notice that\u2019s GB, not MB.  That alone took nearly two hours of downloading.  *  Nearly 900 MB for the Office update that actually takes it from 2013 Preview to a fully functional version.  Another hour shot.  *  Almost another two hours just for assorted app and program updates not included above.Maybe I should add another couple \u201cvery\u201d to the internet connection description above.  Plan on kissing most of your first day goodbye.Screen Clarity:Bright and clear as either can get and probably a tick more so than the Surface.  One of the better screens I\u2019ve seen on a tablet screen.  Of note, Amazon warns of light bleeding on the screen but I never noticed any although the shiny screen does little for outside usability.Of note, the screen is Corning\u2019s \u201cFit\u201d variety.  Depending upon what you read or who you talk to, this glass is either inferior to or the equivalent of \u201cGorilla\u201d glass.  Take your pick since my experience has shown that if you abuse either you\u2019ll end up with scratches.Video/Audio:Audio is great with decent speakers although they do lack some bass.Video is iffy, but a lot of that depends upon the internet connection.  Even with my DSL connection some videos stuttered at 360p.  Maybe it\u2019ll do better with a more stout internet signal but I can\u2019t tell right now.Keyboard:You\u2019ve got your choice of two here -- onboard and external.Internally is the same onscreen snafu you\u2019ve seen with Android or iOS devices.  Count on about half of your keystrokes being misinterpreted.  Where is verbal input when you need it?Externally, think netbook.  Remember those?  About 97% of a standard sized keyboard but just cramped enough to be occasionally frustrating.  Good key feel, though, but you will find the smaller than average shift and return keys a miscue waiting to happen.There is a little tick with the external version, though.  Since it has a physical connection to the tablet (which, literally, clicks and locks into a groove at the back of the keyboard) folding and unfolding is something of a challenge, at least the latter part.Once the two parts are locked in, folding is a snap and is akin to a laptop.Unfolding is something different.  The hinge is stiff and a great deal of pressure is necessary to coerce the two into cooperating.  Maybe this will change with time but I can\u2019t tell quite yet.Battery:This is an unusual unit in that both the tablet and keyboard have batteries and can be charged independently or together when linked as a single unit.  As such, total battery life can approach 14 hours (16 states Asus but that was probably taking the unit to danger levels) with the keyboard attached and somewhere around 8 without.  In my test I made 6.75 hours with the tablet alone before getting panicky and plugging it back in, so 8 is not out of the question; however, if you\u2019ve got good eyes or a dark room you can turn the brightness down and get nearly 10 hours (with wi-fi off).Why not a test with the keyboard?  Seems there is a quirk here.  When connected to the keyboard, power is drawn mainly from the tablet and then the keyboard.  Since the tablet uses more power it will discharge first.  One time I decided to disconnect the tablet and didn\u2019t realize the battery was dead for the tablet and it did an abrupt shutdown.See the dilemma here?  I\u2019ll have to play with that one some.Of note, yes you can use the unit with the plug in and charging, but there is another  snafu here.  Doing a mouseover of the battery icon in the tray will bring up dual readings with one for the keyboard and the other, naturally, for the tablet; however, neither is labeled.  I eventually determined the bottom reading is for the tablet which  is sort of odd given that the tablet is up top when connected to the keyboard.On final word on this topic -- heat.  There is none.  I mean absolutely zero.  This is the coolest system I\u2019ve worked on in quite a while.Software:Not the OS, you already know that\u2019s RT; however, I will make one point -- go to the app store and get the 8.1 update so you get a little more flexibility and Outlook to boot.One good thing about RT, so to speak, is that Microsoft apparently saw the early flaws in their logic and decided to up the ante by including MS Office 2013 RT with anything that packs RT, even units from competitors (they recently extended that offer to new 10 inch or smaller tablets running Windows 8 and not just RT).Good idea, but be aware it\u2019s about 90% of the full retail package.  No macros, add-ins or third party items allowed, or at least so MS claims; however, you\u2019re still getting a suite that would probably cost you at least $100 elsewhere.Asus added a few programs to sweeten the pot such as SuperNote; however, this unit already comes with MS OneNote making this app something of a questionable addition.Also, be careful of ads that show the Wacom digitizer pen included.  This unit does not come with that.As for that software you\u2019ve got sitting around the house, forget it.  RT allows for nothing outside of its software selections so you can kiss off anything you bought that must be installed.  Like Chrome or Firefox?  Too stinkin\u2019 bad.That I can accept since Android and iOS do the same thing, but I do find the Internet Explorer (IE) browser snafu a bit much.Hmmm, it works something like this.  If you\u2019re in the Metro side (icon side or whatever you call it now) you get IE 10 in the new format.  Go to the Windows 8 side (it\u2019s really Windows 7, folks) you get a modified version of IE 10 that looks like IE 9.What\u2019s the difference?  The Metro version has the URL on the bottom while the 8 version looks like what you\u2019re probably using now.  No great biggie there, but be aware of a wrinkle -- adding bookmarks on the 8 side doesn\u2019t transfer over to the Metro side or vice versa.But maybe that small SSD has other problems, too.  After you discount the space for RT and the other little add-ons from Asus, you\u2019ve got all of 16GB to play with.Final Thoughts:This isn\u2019t a bad unit in any respect but, like almost anything else, it does have a few quirks.  The major hurdle for many will probably be the price while others may see the smallish SSD as a too-tall hurdle.And by now you\u2019re wondering how a price of less than $400 in many cases can be a problem.  Take a look around and you may have noticed that many laptops packing full Windows 8 have taken a price nosedive (mainly because of the OS) and it\u2019s entirely possible to find a decent laptop for around the same price or a little more.Is this a laptop replacement?  Not really since the lack of program compatibility is a great detraction and the MS app store isn\u2019t exactly wowing customers, but it might make a great unit for the student in the family or the person who mainly surfs the web and does an occasional report.", "Title": "Long Version Review", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "J. Dash \"Benchmarker\"", "ReviewID": "RUF80JT0O73OG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me say first that I, too, was a little worried about getting my free dock. Almost two weeks passed and on the Asus website my claim still just said \"Application submitted\" or something similar. I called up Asus and the gentleman I spoke to said that due to the high volume of submissions it takes about 2-3 weeks to get people their keyboard docks - totally understandable. If I haven't gotten my dock by the end of the third week I was to call back and let them know. Luckily, I bought my Vivo Tab from Micro Center and two days after calling Asus, I got a letter from MC stating I should bring my receipt and that letter back to the store to claim my free dock. The letter also stated that if I submitted my info on Asus's website that my info was most likely referred back to MC. So I promptly drove over to MC and got my dock for free. Asus may be doing this for a lot of claims to lighten the load on the website, perhaps, and to get people their docks faster. That way Asus reduces the chance of customers either returning the tablet or writing a horrible review (which exist on this site).The actual tablet has a great battery life and is very snappy. No lag (or none worth complaining about). We bought our tablet for vacation because it's much easier to pack and take around than a laptop is. We just threw ours in a neoprene slip case and put it in my camera bag. No fuss. No muss. Charges quickly and, on a full charge, lasts all day. Great for viewing photos, watching movies, the internet, and even using a little MS Office. We also picked up a CHEAP (Inland brand, $12) notebook bluetooth mouse which the tablet recognized and connected with right away. Why a mouse? Well, it's better than a track pad and some websites still don't play nice with touchscreens/tablets.The build of the tablet is actually GREAT. For people complaining about it being flimsy or having an overlapping bezel, they obviously got a defective one and should have returned it promptly. Mine is sleek, slim, and sexy. The construction is solid and feels great. It's light and slightly tapered towards the edges which makes it easy to hold. I wish it had a built-in full-size USB port but using the little adapter that comes with it isn't so bad and once you get the dock it's no longer a problem at all.Overall it's a great tablet and the only down side right now stems from limitations of Windows 8 RT. The good news is is that Win 8 RT keeps getting updates and apps daily and the tablet keeps getting better. Go get one!*UPDATE 1*One of the best things about having this tablet is how seemless it works with your Windows Homegroup. My wife had a recipe that she wanted to try but it was on her laptop in the other room. For the record, we have VERY limited counter space in our kitchen and, with cooking/baking stuff spread out there isn't even enough room for a 15\" laptop. Plus it's a few years old so it's a little heavy for its size. With the VivoTab (and dock), I just grabbed her recipe through our home network (homegroup). Then I placed the VivoTab (w/dock) on top of our coffee maker and she was ready to go. Try THAT on an Android tablet!*UPDATE 2*I'm actually writing this update on the Vivo Tab with the dock. Of course it's a smaller keyboard so it takes a little getting used to BUT once you adjust it's easy to use and waaaaay better than a touchscreen keyboard. That said, printing from this tablet is great! Our wireless Epson printer was found and drivers installed easily. This tablet prints just like a laptop. Super easy. With the keyboard dock, you almost forget that you have a tablet. A touchscreen laptop is the best hybrid machine and being able to detach the tablet is great. We're so spoiled now with the tablet/dock combo that if we ever buy another laptop it'll have to be touchscreen! In fact, a tablet with a dock almost makes a laptop obsolete. Oh, and don't pay any attention to people saying that the dock doubles the weight of the tablet. It's still ridiculously light and convenient. Any lighter and it would feel cheap. This feels solid and dependable. Love it.*UPDATE 3*Now that the NHL is back in action, I use this tablet to watch games on GameCenter Live when either I'm not home or can't sit in front of the TV when I am. There isn't an app for it (Android tabs NEED the app) but this tablet doesn't need it! Plays the website video perfectly (looks amazing) which Android Tabs can't - not even the news videos. Two months in and still loving this tablet!", "Title": "Love my Vivo Tab!", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQOINACC1W46I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Back in December, I picked up two tablets to evaluate - a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and this ASUS Vivo Tab RT.  I already have an iPad, so with all of these devices, I felt I was in a good position to evaluate the relative strengths & weaknesses.  I'll try to keep my thoughts about the Vivo Tab focused, but feel free to ask questions via the Comment link.PROS:* One of the best overall feature sets of any tablet on the market today. This alone should put this on your list of contenders if you're shopping for a tablet right now.* Office 2013 - While iOS and Android devices have good work suites available (I'd give the nod to iOS), they are not free.  And they are more limited.  Win 8 RT gives you the latest versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote for FREE!  There are a handful of features missing that you get with the full MS-Office suite (e.g. the equation editor in Word), but you get everything that most people need.* NFC - if you're not familiar with it yet, you will be soon. NFC (Near Field Communications) will be increasingly used for mobile payment systems, fast & secure file transfers, and more.  No iPads have NFC support yet, nor do any Android tablets that I am familiar with yet, nor does the excellent Windows Surface RT tablet.* Great expansion options and peripheral support.  The included USB port (full port on the keyboard dock, dongle when using the tablet w/o the keyboard) means you can use peripherals like a thumb drive or USB hard drive, and the microSD card slot means you can easily & cheaply add more storage. Try that on an iPad!  I've used this to access data on my USB thumb drives. They've all worked well and the performance has been excellent.* Great overall performance.  The quad core processor gives this tablet very snappy performance, at least on par with other latest-model tablets.* Great aesthetics.  Nice look & feel.  The tablet itself is quite light making it nicer to hold than heavier tablets like an iPad.* Split screen option. Windows RT allows you to use 2 apps simultaneously - e.g. email and video. Unfortunately, you cannot control the size of the windows (they have fixed widths - roughly 25% / 75%), but this is still a nice feature.  Note that Android Jelly Bean does allow for multiple windows, and you have full control over those.* Metro interface. Some might make fun of it, but I've really been enjoying it. I love the larger tiles - similar to widgets on Android - that provide live info.  It makes looking at the app icons on my iPad seem very dated.  In fact, I've really preferred using the Vivo Tab over my iPad most of the time.  I also enjoy being able to quickly access the device settings w/o having to leave my app (something you cannot do on the iPad).  And I can easily search the app store, web, or my device from any screen, too.CONS* Screen.  It is a beautiful screen, but it I wish it had higher resolution.  This doesn't affect most things you do on the tablet, and movies still look good, but I really wish it had the same full HD display as the ASUS' Android version of this tablet.* Windows 8 app store.  Yes, this is the current achilles heel for Windows 8 devices.  The app store pales in comparison to what is available for iOS and Android.  Today I wanted to use my Vivo Tab for a WebEx webinar, but Cisco has not released a Windows RT app yet.  But it does get better every day, and there is a large core of very solid apps for most of what you need.* Speakers.  The volume could be a bit better (very minor gripe), but it is adequate, and the sound is clear. And unlike some other tablets, I find the volume control to be well-placed and easy to use.* Keyboard.  Overall the keyboard dock is great.  However, I find it a bit challenging to type on.  It is certainly not a replacement for a regular keyboard, but it does allow you to type much faster than the virtual (on-screen) keyboard. The real estate is taken up in part by a palm rest and touch pad (which does work quite well) - very similar to a keyboard on a notebook computer.  I wish they had skipped the touchpad and used the space to make the keyboard itself less cramped.* Windows RT consumes quite a bit of space - around 13GB, I believe. This still leaves plenty of space, though, and with a microSD slot (plus the ability to use USB drives), storage shouldn't be an issue.SHOULD YOU BUY THIS?The Vivo Tab is well designed, full of features, and a real joy to use.  $ for $, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better value.  But is it the right tablet for YOU?If you are tied to Windows - either because of MS-Office or because of using other Windows machines, then the ASUS Vivo Tab is a great choice.  Integration within the Windows ecosystem should be tight, and it is a far better value than the Surface RT tablet.  If you want a tablet that helps you be more productive in your work, then this is a really strong contender across the board.  It's also a great all-around tablet.  However, for creative types who will want to do extensive audio, photo & video work, go with the iPad or possibly the Galaxy Note 10.1.  Those wanting a tablet mostly for gaming should look at Android options or the iPad unless you are already invested in MS gaming.", "Title": "Not Perfect, but Among the Best Tablet Options Right Now", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Author": "A. Anderson \"Adam Bomb\"", "ReviewID": "R2VFIZKAMMCKNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: FLASH NOW WORKS.We purchased two of these from a box store.  Got the keyboard docks included in the store price as we couldn't do the rebate thru Asus (something about it being a store purchase vs online purchase).This tablet appears to be more productivity oriented, especially with the keyboard dock.  We own an iPad as well as Kindle Fires but we aren't using those now that we have the Vivo Tabs.  The fact that it comes preinstalled with Office is a huge benefit.  The ability to print is very useful as well.  While there are less apps for now, we are sure that Microsoft will have a lot more apps very soon.  As it is, we didn't get these to play games, although one of ours does have Angry Birds Star Wars on it now  and it's nice to be able to go to Yahoo games and be able to play them with the keyboard (iPad doesn't support Flash and the Fire didn't work on that site either).The speed and smoothness of this operating system is very impressive.  One of us is a die hard Mac fan but fell in love with this system.  The other is a picky software developer.  RT is extremely user friendly.  Surfing the web is very fast.  Very little, if any, delay loading sites.  None of our other tablets come even close.Battery life is incredible.  The one I'm typing on right now was charged the night before last.  Used all day yesterday and into the night.  Used all day today and the tablet battery is still over 50% charged.  The keyboard battery makes a huge difference.  While this unit, with the keyboard dock ends up thicker than the Surface, the extra battery life is very appealing.  Never have to worry about carrying a charger around just in case.  Also makes it sturdier on your lap and feels more protected for transport.  The keyboard took a little getting used to due to size but quickly became easy. Love that the dock has a built in full sized USB port.  Also love that the tablet has a micro-SD slot for extra storage. We've been using the cloud services so that hasn't been necessary yet but it's nice to have as an option.One of the keyboard docks we got did have issues and we exchanged it for one that worked.  While hooked up to the power adapter it wasn't charging the tablet.  Charge from the battery is supposed to charge the tablet and it wasn't doing that either.  It just worked as a keyboard.  With the replacement everything is working as it should.  Both dock and tablet charge from the one port and when the tablet gets down to about 70% the dock starts to send its charge to the tablet. Then you will see the tablet battery% go up and the dock % go down.If you're looking for something that's productivity oriented, fun, a good user experience, and you don't need to install desktop software, this is a great option.  However, if all you need is web, Office, games, and other apps, this could easily be a main system.", "Title": "Great productivity tablet", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "Gene M Phipps", "ReviewID": "R8GGEN005KTBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I asked my Mom if she wanted a refresh of her iPad for Christmas she said, \"refresh yes, another iPad not so much\".  We looked at all the new tablets and she picked this Asus Vivo Tab.  I played with it for about a week before Christmas so I would be able to help her with any problems, (she is 75) and was totally impressed with the build quality and design--I would go as far as saying they are outperforming Apple here which is obviously not easy to do.  The design and build quality are that good.The removable tablet/keyboard dock form factor is spot on IMO.  The tablet was fairly easy to attach and remove from the base, it feels a little awkward at first as you get used to it.  It vibrates and plays a chime tone when you have attached it correctly which helps.  It takes both hands to dock/detach which is fine with me as when it is attached it really feels attached--I only mention it because it is not as effortless as the cute little magnetic click covers.  Over our Christmas visit, (4 days) I noticed my Mom tended to just keep it attached to the keyboard dock so I mentioned and demonstrated several times that the tablet could be removed--she finally just told me she actually preferred it with the base attached for most uses as it \"held itself up perfectly\".  I think she felt more secure being able to set it on her lap or the table and even preferred holding it by the base as it felt \"safer\".  I was able to type pretty well on the chicklet style keyboard even though I have quite long fingers.  I could match the 20-30 wpm I type at on my desktop keyboard without any problem.  My wife who has very small hands but can type at 80-100 wpm took to it instantly.  Tactile feedback for key presses felt very good to me.  Key layout and spacing is well thought out.  My only complaint would be the lack of back lighting--something I tend to like.  Not a deal breaker by any stretch as the keyboard is obviously pretty close to the screen and it does cast some light on it.  Touch typists won't care at all of course.The screen is great with excellent brightness/contrast/viewing angles etc. I did not see any ghosting or artifacts so refresh rates are good.  No pixelation in movies during action sequences and explosions and playback was smooth as butter.I forgot to check the NFC \"tap to share\".  Sorry.The gyroscopes and accelerometer seemed to work fine in the few games I tried.  The screen oriented pretty rapidly when rotated.  The closer it was to \"upright\" the faster it seemed to register--as with all tablets.Sound was better than any other tablet I have used but still lacks enough volume for all uses IMO.  Headphones and my Nu Force UDAC 2 sounded excellent.The wireless NIC was great.  I got 4 of 5 bars out on the front porch, about 30 feet from a typical Link-Sys home router, and her house has a brick exterior.  Anywhere inside I usually had 5 of 5 bars.I really liked the Windows 8 live tile Touch UI --Metro or w/e they are calling it now.  I also found the \"desktop\" portion of RT to be quite usable, especially with the touch pad and pointer on the dock.  It was usable (but just barely) with a finger.  I would miss the button I was aiming for about 40% - 50% of the time.  My Mom already uses a stylus on her iPad so I was able to try one in the windows/desktop environment and it makes it a LOT more usable.  The included office apps were all excellent.  Being able to use files and folders was also very useful/comfortable for me, especially with either a stylus or the track pad and cursor.  The track pad seemed fine to me but to be candid I detest them and am NOT a laptop person, so it could be awesome or horrible compared to other products and I would not know.  My Mom uses a lap top and liked the track pad, as did my wife who also uses a laptop.  I tried my Logitech Performance MX mouse with it's tiny little USB RX and it was detected and worked fine.  I also tried various USB memory sticks and my Galaxy S2 phone and all were auto detected and worked without issue.Windows joined my Moms home network without any problems and adding a printer was going fine...right up until we got to the HP drivers list and her laser printer model was not listed.  To be fair to HP the printer is older than dirt and my Pops has to run Windows XP on all their machines because he can't find printer drivers.  The drivers list had a LOT of printers so I doubt most people will have a problem.  When I was \"testing\" the Vivo Tab RT at home the week before Christmas I was able to print to my Canon color printer which is about 5 years old, and the Wife's HP 3 in 1 Photo Smart.The Windows 8 App market is not as filled out as Apple's or Androids--not sure what she will do without 50,000 Baby Shaker and Fart Apps--but she had all her Board Games and Bottle Cap type games loaded in about an hour.  Think Yahtzi, (SP?) Bejewled, MahJong etc.  She also had her Cook Book program and Kindle App and all her Solitaire games.  The news paper and magazine selection seemed pretty good to me.  She liked the FaceBook and Skype Apps.  Her Yahoo email worked fine and the live tiles are actually kind of useful/cool.  The mult-tasking is functional...not so sure about the way they split rhe dual view as a third of the screen...though everything seemed to re-size itself correctly when it was in the \"little half\" of the screen.To sum it up for Windows 8 RT:  I really like the Metro touch UI a lot, (can't wait to get a windows 8 phone in fact) and the more traditional desktop portion of the OS is quite familiar and usable with either a wireless mouse, the track pad, or a stylus.  Not so much with a \"clunky\" finger.  My only complaint would not be with either environment, but the clunky way Microsoft dumps you from one to the other.  The duplicate programs like IE for example.  There is a Touch version and a \"windows\" version.  They may have done that for people who are going to spend a lot of time in one or the other I guess, meaning if I was \"plugged into windows\" and had a mouse running and was working in office the windows version of IE might be more useful then the times I was on the couch just tooling around the web.  I could use this OS as is right now without too much trouble and be very productive (and happy).  I think it feels about 80% polished and I feel comfortable that future versions will cover that last 20% pretty quickly.  I also think that the App store will fill out pretty rapidly for those needing more specialized apps like medical charting, pilots, engineers etc.I took advantage of the free dock deal Asus was running and I have to say that their customer interaction is not great by any stretch.  The online form I had to fill out was pretty clunky and I could not get logged into my \"VIP\" account.  Getting any information from their FAQ and forums was a waste of time and getting a person on the phone took a while.  Once I did get a person,  (who surprisingly spoke English) they were competent and got me squared away pretty quickly.  Asus makes exceptionally good products in my experience, but their PR, and customer support still have a ways to go.  I got the Dock 15 calendar days after I filled out the online form which seems reasonable for a rebate type \"free\" item.The hardware from Asus is just flat out WONDERFUL and I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I will be buying their Transformer Book in 14\" or 15\" the minute it is available.

I got this tablet with the hopes of replacing my giant MacBook Pro when I am on the road...so when the deal came to woot.com, I snagged this sucker up.I got to say..w the dock...this thing rocks.  It feels and works like a real computer...like a 10\" netbook...w 16hrs of life.  I can do many things here I can not do on my Android...and a whole lot more than the ipad.For one, this thing has a REAL BROWSER...yes, Microsoft will not allow any other browser on its OS...which is BS...but, you get a real browser...which means...you don't need no stinking apps...like you do on the ipad/android.  The browser is quite robust with multi-windows...and it runs Flash, etc (suck that Apple!)...It has a full version of Office built in...so you don't need to deal w wannabes...works great w the dock/keyboard...you can do real work while on the road.Since the battery lasts forever, you can do real work with it without worrying about it running out of battery.  So I would just leave it running like a real desktop computer.Of course, this is no substitute for my MacBook Pro...but for on the road...or just hanging out on the deck..this thing is fabulous.The screen is beautiful..and the camera is very decent.As you would expect (despite the fancy marketing speak), the speakers suck.  You can hardly hear anything on it...especially outdoors, but that was to be expected.The CPU is quite decent...it is very zippy compared to my Android.Some negatives...as of writing...there is no Outlook/Contacts manager.

I got another VivoTab RT, same problem. Turns out that if there is any kind of case that has a tiny magnet that activates the wake/sleep feature there are all kinds of problems. A quick Google search backs this up.  ASUS customer relations have tried to be very helpful but in the end could only advise not to use a case that does auto wake/sleep. Why have that capability if it makes the tablet unstable?  The final straw was a stuck pixel. I have FIVE other tablets from various vendors.  I haven't had crashes or stuck pixels on any of them, although my nexus 7 coincidentally by ASUS also has quality issues. Another problem area is auto brightness. While it works well on all of my non ASUS tablets it is jarring on ASUS tablets and has to be disabled.There are just too many issues with this tablet to justify keeping it. I'll be significantly out of pocket with the accessories I have purchased that can't be returned. Having a case cause crashes is completely unacceptable. This device should never have been put on the market. It's not like this is a cheap tablet, such low quality is inexcusable.That said, top marks for effort for the ASUS rep who has tried to help out.Reluctantly, I'll be switching to a Microsoft Surface RT.ORIGINAL REVIEWI'm giving this a 2 star review purely due to device quality, not functionality.  I am returning this device, haven't even waited for the refund before purchasing another.  I ordered another without much hesitation.  So what's wrong with the device and why did I still order another one?  Keep reading to the end for why I would give it a five star review if not for the hardware problem.I firmly believe that the problems I encountered are due to faulty hardware and not due to Windows RT.Basically, when I don't have a micro sd inserted the device is rock solid.  When I have a micro sd installed and open the case to wake up the device I get frequent device restarts and memory dumps.  No micro sd card inserted no problem.  I'll admit that after having 2 poor quality nexus 7 tablets I'm very wary of asus QC but the vivo tab RT will be awesome if the replacement doesn't have the sd card issue.Even with random crashes resulting in device reboots I have still not used my android tablet or iPad 3 since getting this.  To my surprise I really like Windows RT.  I had bought this purely so I could do some app development and test on a tablet, not to replace my iPad but found the device a joy to use.The start screen;  The live tiles are awesome.  I love the live widgets on android and this is more of the same.  It is very easy to navigate, have the information that I need at my fingertips and be productive quickly.Having office including onenote on a device with awesome battery life. As much as I like evernote and can make do with other word processors there's nothing quite like having office and onenote wherever I go.I never thought I would ever say this but having Internet Explorer is great compared to the browsers on android and IOS.  PArtly because RT is a more controlled platform and I don't have the security concerns that I would otherwise have using IE on the desktop, which I simply don't do.  That said, on Windows RT browsing the web is awesome, things just work.The VivoTab RT itself has a decent screen, just be sure to turn off auto brightness, just as with the Nexus 7 the auto brightness on this device is jarring, much worse than non asus devices I have used.  The tablet is light weight and the battery life is good.  Add to that a micro sd slot (assuming on the replacement it doesn't crash my device when used) and the micro hdmi this device has decent IO capabilities.  Add to that the keyboard dock and you have an awesome machine.The device itself is lighter than the Microsoft Surface and I prefer how it feels in the hand.  The dock was really the killer feature when compared to the Surface.  Having a real keyboard and 14+ hours battery life means that this device is so much more than a tablet.I did install a couple of games on the tablet, the graphics are amazing, but performance takes a hit due to the relatively low spec of the device compared to a Surface Pro or traditional laptop or desktop running Windows 8.I look forward to writing a five star review should the replacement not have any hardware problems.", "Title": "Too many hardware issues", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "dkilbo02", "ReviewID": "R9ESPNLCOHBEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a ton of research on several tablets and had narrowed it down to the Google Nexus 7 or a Windows tablet.  The main thing that had me leaning towards the Nexus was how connected to the Google \"ecosystem\" I was since I use Google products like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Maps, Reader, etc all throughout the day and have an Android smartphone for work.  I ended up going against my Google bias and chose the Vivotab RT.  I was aware of the limitations of Windows RT but also knew that I did not plan on the tablet replacing my desktop or laptop computers.  I predominantly use it for work where the included Office 2013 suite of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and the excellent OneNote works well with Skydrive to access my files.  I also use it casually to watch Netflix & Hulu Plus, check social media like Twitter & Facebook, Skype chat with friends, and the excellent Smartglass App if you are a big Xbox 360 user like my son and I are.  While I don't really use my tablet to take pictures, the 8MP camera on it takes pretty decent pictures (though I wish I had a Picasa type app to edit and better store the pics).  It also works great to read books once I learned a workaround to log me into the Amazon app to read my ebooks.  I use Lastpass for all of my passwords and my Amazon password is a gibberish combination of upper/lowercase letters, numbers and symbols and the app had issues with symbols in the password. Once I changed my password I had access to all of my ebooks purchased from Amazon.The Windows 8 system is much easier on the tablet than my early adoption of Windows 8 on my desktop, due to the ability to swipe and tap the screen.  The battery life is great and was made even better after I picked up the dock from Amazon (I didn't buy the dock and tablet at the same time).The only minor complaint that I have is that the screen, while very bright and clear, is an absolute fingerprint magnet.  I solved this by getting a good stylus from Amazon (which also works great with OneNote).  Any other complaints I have like the horrible Windows Store for apps, are not the fault of the Asus Vivotab and hopefully will be addressed by Microsoft soon.  It is nothing like the Google Play store or the Itunes App store, and makes finding good applications quite difficult.  Also, if you play a lot of games on your tablet the Windows tablet is pretty scarce for good games like you would find on an Ipad or Nexus. I'm not a tablet gamer so it was kind of a non-issue for my personal tastes. I realize that with this being a new platform it will take a bit for the number of apps to match the offerings from competing tablets.  The new Twitter app is great, but there is no Facebook app yet.  Of course you can just use the included Internet Explorer 10 to go to the Facebook site.Overall, I'm a huge fan of this tablet and my friends and family that I've showed the Vivotab RT to have been very impressed with some even looking to buy one themselves.", "Title": "Couldn't be happier!", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Aazyzx", "ReviewID": "R3FPKD3HATWGTN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded from an android tablet to this.

If there is a legacy Windows program that I need to run remotely that doesn't run on RT I simply use the free version of TeamViewer to connect to my home Windows 8 desktop PC and it runs smoothly over a good Internet connection. Around the house I'll use the RT tablet and connect to the desktop PC via Microsoft Remote Desktop over Wi-Fi. You can also use Remote Desktop away from your home network as long as you have a static IP address from your Internet service provider. This is rare, however, and TeamViewer works fine for remote connectivity. I also love the Bing apps, especially News app. It is very clean and easy to read with a good selection of news topics from various sources. Sports app is the same way.

Windows RT is so very cool to use, although it has taken some getting used to, as the some of the swiping motions(closing or uninstalling an app to name a couple) are not quite as intuitive as. If you take the time to use help and tutorials you'll get it within minutes.My main two gripes are that I purchased this because I thought it was fully flash compatible but many websites tell me that I need the latest version of flash player to run them. One way that I've gotten around this was opening things up from the internet Explorer from the desktop instead of the explorer app straight from the home screen.  This was very frustrating initially because I was trying to access test study materials with video that uses flashplayer and I had a limited number of views of the material with my subscription. I used up half of them just trying to get the blasted thing to work right.Otherwise, this tablet is proving to be more and more useful as the days go. So glad I opted for this one! As a part of a technology grant we received a few iPads to work with our kids.  The iPad is very fun and there are so many more free educational and just cool apps right now since they've had a few years head start, but every time I go on the Windows store I find another cool app(including some educational) I can use and the graphics are pretty nice(just a little more simplistic animations than apple apps.) As I install more and more  I'm still trying to figure out how to best organize me apps but its not too difficult to move the most frequently used app mini windows to the first area. Also, it is so awesome to be able to use MSOffice and much of the same stuff can be done on these versions that you can do on a full sized PC or laptop.", "Title": "So much to say...", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "cuda77", "ReviewID": "R31OZ31RH7GZ3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet!

So far as I know the 64GB wifi version selling on Amazon costs 799 and I have no idea if the 3G version is even available in the US.Anyways, to the tablet itself. I was going after the Nexus 10 for a pure entertainment tablet. The 2560*1600 resolution plus the new A15 cortex 1.7ghz dula core cpu seems like to be the best candidate so far. I was skeptical with the windows 8 RT since the only difference with the full fledged version (the only part I'm concerned) was the inability to run legacy apps. Since I could return the tablet in 30 days and I wasn't back in the US yet, I bought this tablet at a local store for a considerably lower price than in the US. Since there are tons of quality. technical reviews out there, I'll just focus on my personal experience of the tablet.The fluidity of the tablet was surprisingly good. Though the loading time is considerably slower than my i5-3317U SSD laptop, the fact that the tablet is using a tegra 3 cpu and did not show any lags while transitioning between apps and executing them is pretty impressive. The Office 2013 preview was also impressive as well, though the cpu seems to struggle a bit when I am being productive (writing an essay and making a presentation), but the overall experience is still fluid and satisfying. The screen is brighter than my 400 nits ultrabook, so it was of no problem for me to use the tablet outdoors in the sun, though glare is still present. Also, the 1366*768 resolution was good, but not great. Since the pinch to zoom gesture is freakishly smooth, I wouldn't mind if the resolution was higher even if that means smaller texts. The colors on the screen is pretty vibrant, but I've seen better. The 3G worked flawlessly, coupled with the Asus sms app for messaging, the tablet nearly replaced my Sony Xperia S (just barely).Overall, the tablet was an awesome piece of equipment. Originally looking for an entertainment tablet only, now I have a tablet that not only fulfills that, but also allows me to actually work (like taking notes in class), browse, and text at the same time anywhere. However, one must be content with the current hardware that is just sufficient for the OS because for me I know what I am getting and I am not at all unsatisfied of my purchase. The Windows 8 RT is a wonderful OS in terms of looks and performance (I have had friends and strangers alike praise the fluidity and simply the coolness of the various gestures and app transitioning), and because of that I am willing to wait for its application ecosystem to mature. I am an owner of several Windows PCs, Android phone and tablets, a retina macbook pro, i pod touch 4th and a small macbook (still working great even with the ridiculously low end hardware, thanks to the great OS), I have experienced almost all of the mainstream OSs out there, and I seriously believe that when the day comes that the apps are considered mature enough and when paired with the upcoming hardware, such as tegra 4 (2 ghz quad) and the A15 cortex (hopefully quad when chosen), the Windows 8 RT can pose a serious threat to the Android and even the iOS system in the tablet world.", "Title": "Vivotab 64GB HSPA+ version", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Martin Pichinson \"shrwood\"", "ReviewID": "RVNCXFSYIC6KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With some mixed reviews I was concerned, but it seems the reviewers were and are just LAZY.

Anaximenes", "ReviewID": "R1VRV04RBPC7QK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a IT solutions manager I am fortunate enough to demo dozens of the latest products, and the ASUS VivoTab was one of those I worked with last week. Having had a bad experience with an Asus customer service on a tab in the past, I was a bit put off from the brand for a while, but this tablet has won me back over.There is plenty of tech specs available in previous reviews, so I'll stick to the layman's version, forgoing my technical analysis of this piece in favor of a user friendly review.The hardware and build are superior to that of the iPad 2 and 3, without question. Asus is a reliable, workhorse of a machine and this device showcases their ability to produce a top of the line device at a price that isnt significantly above the average for an inferior product.While the battery on the VivoTab is rumored to get 16 hours on a full charge, I found this to be slightly overstated. I fully charged and then subsequently discharged it thrice, once in standby, once in heavy use, and once with a balance between the two. With heavy use, I got 8.75 hours of battery life, which still surpasses the competitors, and is quite impressive.The 10.1\" screen is far more receptive and responsive than we find in other tablets of the same size, which was quite pleasing. I was perfectly content with my XYBoard and Galaxy Tab's screens, having believed that a screen couldn't get much more responsive than they offered, but the ASUS VivoTab has proven me wrong. There is no noticeable lag whatsoever, and navigating through screens is both seamless and smooth. The HD display is marvelous, and with crystal clarity.While I am generally of the opinion that Android OS tablets are the pick of the litter, the seamless fusion of Windows' flexibility and Asus' top of the line hardware have made this one a tough competitor and quite likely the victor in a face off between it and the Nexus line.", "Title": "The Best of The Windows Tabs, Bar None", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"", "ReviewID": "R35BOMIJ7LS0C1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'd really love to give this tablet 5 stars but for a few reasons I simply cannot, I'll discuss those issues in this review.First let's talk about the good things of the Vivotab RT...This is a well-made product, it's built with high quality plastic, the case pieces are firmly fastened, and I haven't witnessed any flex in the tablet. For something so thin, this really feels solid. I can't vouch for what happens when it's dropped (since I haven't dropped it) but I feel like a short drop would be easily withstood.The screen on the VivoTab RT is amazing, very clear and bright, a wide bezel makes it easy to hold the tablet on its edges without accidently hitting the screen. Touch input is lightning fast and very precise, though I still use the add-on keyboard when editing a word document or in \"Desktop Mode\". In a touch-optimized setting, even games like Halo Spartan Assault are easy to play on this touch screen, and the wide-screen format is much more enjoyable than tablets like the iPad or my Touchpad which just seem odd to use...Windows 8 RT for the most part is very good, internet browsing, game playing, streaming, or just fiddling around with the menu is always a pleasure. The split screen function is something that makes this tablet actually useful if you're the type of person who likes to put a movie on in the background while doing some work.The VivoTab RT is extremely powerful, I have yet to have a program hang due to resource shortage, and the ability to add a micro-sd card is such a joy... I bought a 32 GB UHS-1 micro SD and it's amazingly fast, transferring files between the card and tablet, or watching movies from the card is a flawless experience.Now comes the VivoTab RT's shortcomings...#1 - Windows 8 RT: It angers me that Microsoft did what they do with the Windows Phones to their supposed, laptop-replacement tablet as well. The small amount of video files that natively play on the VivoTab RT is infuriating. If a Samsung device can play MKVs, AVIs, WMV, and MP4s why the heck won't Microsoft let their OS do the same? You cannot play any MKVs natively on the Vivotab (and I have yet to find a suitable app to do the trick), and I have only been able to play certain AVIs, MP4s, and WMVs on the VivoTab, not all have worked, even using  3rd party apps. Most of the video files that did work, did not work well, playback was choppy, and almost unwatchable, small files (300mb or less) played well, but 700mb movies were subject to lag in my experience. The one bright spot here is that the Netflix app works perfectly, and streaming through the program appears to be semi-HD and depending on your internet connection plays back extremely smoothly. I have no doubt in my mind that the 2gb of ram and quad core processor the VivoTab RT possesses is capable of playing video files flawless, it's the software that is holding it back (and I have to think it's Microsoft doing it on purpose)#2 - The Speakers: Sadly I must report that the speakers on the VivoTab are subpar at best. Situated on the back of the tablet, and apparently tiny I have found it near impossible to watch most all of my video files or Netflix through the built in speakers, headphones or external speakers are a must and even the headphone jack doesn't get very loud... I have the keyboard dock and I really wish Asus had added some beefier speakers on the dock as a bonus...#3 - App availability: Unfortunately the Windows 8 RT marketplace is not nearly as diverse as the Windows Phone marketplace, I came expecting all the same apps I have on my Windows Phone and more apps geared towards a desktop setting. Unfortunately that is not what I got, there just aren't enough apps on Windows 8 RT to make me happy, and the distinct lack of a solid FTP client and other video players is truly disheartening. As I just found out yesterday there is apparently no way to sync your WP 8 device with this tablet, which was also annoying... A suitable laptop replacement this tablet does not make, and I blame it on the lack of apps.#4 - Asus vs. MSFT: It isn't such a big deal but Asus and Microsoft appear to not get along very well. Asus included a flash with their rear camera, but depending on the specific Windows update it may or may not work. Microsoft seems hell bent on stifling Asus's attempts at being different, I have a sneaking suspicion that the quietness of the speakers/headphone jack is also Microsoft's doing because the VivoTab RT is supposed to have a special HD sound driver, but I've experienced nothing of the sort.In the end, I really wish I could give this tablet a 5 star rating. The potential is absolutely there, hardware-wise this tablet is top-notch, unbeatable. But Windows 8 RT is a real hindrance, maybe windows RT 8.1 will fix these issues but we'll just have to wait and see. If you don't plan on using a keyboard ever with the tablet (something I wouldn't recommend) then I would probably look for a cheaper tablet. If you do plan on using a keyboard then this is probably your best bet since the Surface's soft-cover keyboard is pretty useless and I don't know if they are still doing a deal on the hard cover.If you really want a laptop replacement I guess I'd have to suggest you get a Windows 8 Pro tablet, but those are easily twice the price of the Windows 8 RT tablets... The ball is in Microsoft's court, they can make this tablet great. Asus has done all they can do, this hardware is ready to do so much more, but it can't shine until MSFT lets it out of its cage. 3/5 StarsEDIT: I have no choice but to revive my review from 3/5 stars to 2/5 stars. I have had so much trouble with this tablet that I wish I hadn't bought it. My tablet dock has been returned to Asus twice for a total time of well over a month (and had to pay for packaging). Now, my tablet charger has broken and and asus wants me to send it in for service but will not pay for shipping or packaging. This is the last straw. I've already been without this fully functioning tablet for various reasons for 25% of my time owning it... Although these issues are not problems of the tablet itself they are with the accessories fundamental to its use. The way a real company handles issues like this is they send you a replacement device (with a cc on file for deposit) then let you return the defective product so you aren't without your device for the ridiculous amount of time that asus takes to handle service issues. Asus has never heard of doing things this way apparently and it's just getting time consuming and tire-some... I won't be buying another Asus product after this one, and I can't recommend anyone buy this tablet either. Despite it's many styling and performance benefits. It's like buying a high performance car with no reliability.

The Vivo Tab RT is at least as responsive, much more aesthetically pleasing, and in some ways more useful.The desktop and Office apps found therein are very handy, if you attach a keyboard.  Networking and file sharing are just plain easy, compared to the other tablets. I added my desktop's Music and Photos directories to the Vivo Tab's Libraries, and now have a huge collection of media available without transferring files.The Vivo Tab is very slim and light, compared to others.  1.15 pounds is noticeably lighter than 1.5 pounds after a one hour reading session.Unfortunately, the only way I've found to charge it is using the proprietary cable.", "Title": "pleasant surprise!", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R3HW6QNLC07JEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this mainly for school but also for entertainment on my off time.

You can add most email accounts from here.Shoty workmanship:1. Screen bezel overlaps the back cover creating a sharp edge that makes it uncomfortable, reviewer was afraid that if they picked it up with their nails they would rip the bezel off.  The bezel does overlap the back case but it's almost not noticeable on mine. I have to run my finger up and down the side with a lot of pressure to make this uncomfortable.  The top and bottom dont have this problem.2. Tablet is wiggly in the dock.  Yes, it has a loose feeling in the keyboard dock.  I have an Asus Transformer TF101 that I purchased two years ago.  It did not have the same issue brand new but over time it became very loose.  Not sure why this tablet is so loose in the dock, maybe it was designed that way to reduce stress on the tablet?  It works just find and when I have the keyboard docked I don't do much interacting with the screen as I'm usually seated somewhere typing.3.  The camera flash.  I have been playing with this since I got the device and have not found a way to get the flash to operate.  I havent googled for a solution yet, I would think that one could easily turn the flash on or off.  The flash might not work at all, it wouldnt work for me in any lighting conditions with autoflash on.  I docked a star because of this.4.  Rigidness.  Someone had mentioned that it's too flimsy.  I think I even read that in an online review.  The tablet I have received feels strong and rigid.  It doesn't flex or give when I press squeeze side/bezel and it doesn't twist while adjusting my hold on the device.  It feels very well put together, just like my Transformer TF101.There are some small annoyances, mostly with the mail app.  An example, you can't move items from your inbox to another folder listed to the left.  So if I wanted to move an item to junk, I can't just drag it there.  In that example I am working in my hotmail account, one would think this would be a feature of the mail app but it is not.  The mail app doesnt even have a \"move\" button that I can click to move a message.  I can't see docking a star for this as this is just a minor annoyance.IMO the low price more than makes up for the minor flaws of this device.  I did take one star off because of the flash, but as another person already stated that is something that should have been worked out before it shipped.", "Title": "Was skeptical", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "Mike in SJ", "ReviewID": "R1YR9DIYCI1MUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I LOVE this tablet!Pros (not in any particular order):- Everything in Windows RT runs pretty smooth. Sure, it's not as fast as PCs based on fast Intel CPUs but so far I haven't found it bothersome. I would say speed is pretty much on par with other ARM based tablets.- UI is very well designed. It's very efficient and in many ways more advanced than the competition. For example, faster task switching and multitasking \"snap\" mode.- You can't beat the battery life on this. Without the dock, I get 9+ hours. With the dock, 14 hours.- Super light without the dock. It's still pretty light with the dock, so most times we use it in docked mode.- NFC. Surface RT doesn't have this. It's very handy to have when you want to quickly share photos, web links, contacts, etc. Works flawlessly with my Nokia Lumia 920 smartphone which also has NFC.- Integrates very nicely with my existing home network. Since it joins my Windows Homegroup, file sharing is very easy.- It somehow recognized and set up my network printer (HP Laserjet M1212NF) automatically and I was able to print right away without any trouble. I was pleasantly surprised.- Windows cloud integration. If you have Windows 8, you probably know what I mean here. Once you login using your Microsoft account for the first time, many things on your tablet are automatically set up for you. Things such as email, contacts, calendar, UI theme, IE bookmarks, etc are automatically synchronzied across all your Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.- Excellent display quality. Very good color reproduction and black level is very deep (i.e. high contrast). Great for photo and movie watching. There are higher resolution tablets out there but I think the difference is minor to nil unless you place the screen pretty close to your face. Since I don't do that in my normal use, the resolution is perfectly good enough for me.- SD card slot for extra storage.- Free Office 2013!Cons:- Tablet body does support USB but it's not a standard USB port. You need to plug in the provided adapter first.

This is Windows RT, which is the new Windows 8 \"Modern\" UI only.  You do have a little desktop mode for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, but that is about it.  You can't install apps on the desktop.  This is not an Intel CPU, it runs the ARM version of Windows.  So you can only use apps that are made for the Windows Store.To me, this is perfect.  I only wanted a tablet for Windows Store apps.  No, there are not a TON of apps right now.  But there are enough.  I got the top 10 apps I used on my iPad for Windows RT.  And I got Word and Powerpoint which I need a LOT for work.  In fact I think this tablet will replace my heavy big laptop for most meetings and business trips.  I can print with it too (something I never got to work from the iPad in a corporate environment).Right now I am easily getting 8+ hours of battery life.  And the keyboard is supposed to add another 8 hours of battery.  That makes something I can carry even for my longest travel days without having to recharge.  The battery life is real too, not like most laptops.  I watched two movies last night and afterwards I still had 60% of the battery remaining.The only drawback to me is the lack of a real USB connection.  You can use the charging port as a USB with a provided little dongle.  But that is a pain to remember to bring with you, and the location is awkward.  I am hoping the keyboard has at least one USB on it.I am an application developer and really wanted this for debugging my store apps on an ARM processor.  This works great for that purpose. You can connect to it using the Visual Studio remote debugger and push your own apps to it very quickly over wifi.I have had this almost a week and have been very, very happy with it.  Even some of the graphic intense games like SoulCraft play really well.  I am sure there are games that will exceed this machines ability, but so far so good for me.  Angry Birds and those like that play with no problem at all.If you need a light weight touchscreen tablet that runs Windows RT and gets good battery like, this is a great choice.

Overall I've been very happy with the tablet.  My wife has the original Kindle Fire and I just purchased the 3rd generation iPad for her for Christmas.  Between the three I'd say the Asus tablet feels the best in my hand.  It seems to be a lot lighter and thinner than the iPad and the Kindle, which is odd since the Kindle is only a 7\" tablet.  Windows RT took me all of 10 minutes to figure out and so far I've been impressed.  The lack of apps and sites where flash will work is frustrating, but it seems like every day a new app is released.  The ESPN app just showed up yesterday, which was one I've been waiting for.  It works nicely when hooked up to a TV via the micro HDMI cable.  One issue I was having is the resolution on the TV was horrible until I set it to just display on the TV instead of duplicating on the tablet and TV.  I was also able to easily pair it with my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.I've had some of the same problems as others have indicated on here.  My application for the free keyboard hasn't changed in 2 weeks and the other day I noticed the bottom right hand corner of the display was starting to pull away from the case.  I'm not sure what they use to keep it together because it will not snap back in place.  I did file for an exchange with Amazon and a new one will be arriving today.  I'm not sure how this will impact my free keyboard application since I'll have a new serial number now.  I'm still on the fence on what to do if I have the same problem with the new one.  Exchange it again or spend the extra $ for the Microsoft Surface with a keyboard.  I was also having the problem with the display dimming randomily, but I turned off the auto display feature and that took care of that problem.

Just today I was lucky enough to purchase a Solo Brand Universal Fit case, Model NumberCLS223-4 (sold here at amazon SOLO Classic Collection Universal Fit Booklet Case and Stand for Tablets and e-Readers, 8.5-Inch to 11-Inch (CLS223-4U6)). It fits this tablet beautifully. Holds it tight, swivels and can be placed at three different angles while folded into a stand. This is the best part, the clips that hold the tablet don't interfere with the dock being snapped on to the tablet, so it will hold both if you prefer. It is a really nice case, with a sturdy build for the price. Much nicer than some I have purchased at higher prices. The only bad thing is the back camera can't be used while in the case. If you don't want to go unprotected while waiting for the tablet specific case to come out, I would recommend this one. I would also recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a Windows run tablet.", "Title": "So Happy....", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "raif68", "ReviewID": "RKNWPY1JQDZBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought An Asus Vivo Tab from Microcenter on 11/14 without the free Keyboard, but after 3 days I couldn't turn the tablet on so i exchange it on 11/21/2012 with new one and they gave me the free Keyboard.The tablet is really light, very quick responding and the screen is very nice.The Tablet can get another 32 Gb of memory by the SD slot and it can be connected to the TV by HDMI. The keyboard is great, additional batterer and USB that can be used to connect mouse or anything else. but the keyboard doesn't offer SD slot as is described.

The micro hdmi slot is clumsy and docking the tablet to the keyboard can be frustrating if things don't align just right, but it works as advertised.The problem is Windows RT. Many websites have yet to make it to the compatability list for Flash Playback, and it doesn't actually support Microsoft's Silverlight, opting instead to work with sites with html5. According to Microsoft, you can play the videos on those sites using the desktop version of IE (can't install any other browser with RT if it is not in the Microsoft Store), but I find some sites will not play any videos. There are, of course, workarounds already on the web. It also doesn't have installed any DVD playback software, and no DVD playback software yet exists in the MS Store for RT. The Music metro tile/app doesn't like symbolic links, which I use to keepmy music library on the network instead of the actual tablet. It is also missing Windows Media Player, which is a shame, as that would at least allowed you to more easily build a play list with music stored elsewhere on your network. I have Windows 8 Pro on my other laptop and it overcomes all these issues.

However,  when the tablet is dropped less than an inch from the ground, I don't expect to find a big ding in a corner and the front coming off. While the plastic frame did pop back into place easily, this was still disconcerting. There are many things this tablet does right.  It is a relatively  quick little device and, while limited when compared to a full Windows 8  tablet, I have found that I can get a lot done with the stripped down version of Office that the Vivo comes with. I have made successful PowerPoint and Word  documents for my classes and  would recommend this tablet.... with a case.Update (11/26/2013)The Vivo has sat on my computer desk for almost a month and a half, unused because I haven't needed a mobile Office suite. With that functionality not currently a need, I have found nothing else to do with it. It slows down in IE far too often and certain apps don't work very well with the RT OS (Kindle, for example, won't let me read my comics on the tablet). If it did not have the previously mentioned ding in it, I would probably sell it and get an iPad (which this was originally replacing) for the games AND reading I could do.

I am a Windows developer and I bought this tablet w/the free keyboard (just got it yesterday, so be patient with ASUS) so that I could use it for hardware testing of Windows Store apps in a minimal configuration of Win RT.So far, I am NOT disappointed. In fact, I am thrilled with it. I am not an Apple/Google fan, so I am really glad to see Microsoft entering this segment of the ubiquitous computing ecosystem. Soon I'll be able to go from their phone, to the tablet, to the laptop, to the desktop, to the enterprise fairly seamlessly. I also use Microsoft Office, and I think Microsoft OneNote is one of the best software products ever written! The Student/Home Preview edition of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote 2013 are included.ASUS has done a superb with this third-party vendor offering of the \"tablet with keyboard hybrid\" (like the Microsoft Surface). In fact, I would have purchased a Microsoft Surface 32GB RT, but since I am buying other upgraded hardware for Windows 8 development (I wanted to keep the cost down), and the fact I am very familiar with ASUS motherboards and graphics adapters -- having built several machines using their hardware over the past several years, I felt this was a comparable device.ASUS quality is truly amazing and their pricing is aimed at the more conservative buyer such as myself.Since they are based in Taiwan, you won't have to worry about reading bad news reports like Apple's about working conditions in their factories. These are the Chinese in the \"free market capitalist island nation\" who are making these goods and they aren't new at doing it either!I think that if you give this product a chance, you will be able to \"show it off\" to your competitive frienemies who own competitive products by other manufacturers  with some pride! Microsoft has done an incredibly good job with Windows 8 and this little ASUS RT tablet (with FREE KEYBOARD) is a great way to go. I am already thinking of hundreds of useful applications for it (not just \"apps\", but full blown \"applications\"). Will Microsoft take over the market? Who really knows? I have been around long enough to see Giants fall and Newbies rise (and fall)!My only complaint specific to my tablet is that the SD card on my unit is slightly mis-aligned, so I have to fumble with it a bit to get the tiny memory card out. It appears to be spring loaded (ASUS correct me if I am wrong on that), so with a slight push and slide routine I can get it out okay. I don't change cards that often anyway so I am still very satisfied.I commute on a train using this little guy, so when I don't want to pull out my more powerful laptop for XBox game playing, web-surfing, Netflix streaming or iHeartRadio listening, and so forth, it takes up very little space and it performs like a bigger laptop for those purposes -- even though I can't load programs like Visual Studio, etc. I have \"bigger iron\" for that job.I would highly recommend any tablet that runs Windows 8, but I will recommend this one for the following reasons:1. ASUS is a great company that stands by their products.2. It is a tad lighter than anything I have found so far (lighter than a comparable Surface).3. THE FREE KEYBOARD DOCK UNTIL 12/31/2012!4. The free keyboard contains a second battery. They claim up to 16 hours of use, but I haven't had it long enough to tell.Buy it with confidence!

I've owned many an iPad, Android Tablet and even the HP WebOS tablet and the Kindle Fires (all of them... :x ). So far, I haven't found a ton of business use for the tablets other than email, or for a professional to keep in contact with home and entertain himself/herself while on the go. Every time the conclusion is that something like an Ultrabook is more useful with a full keyboard.That is-- until this tablet. I don't know that it's the saviour, but it has promise, and I'll outline why (and why not) below.I personally use an iPhone full time for work, I have an Android personally for learning and haven't found a really useful tablet for business until this one. The way the UI is designed in RT really lends itself to streamlined simplicity, email and web use. The fact that it's windows under the hood makes for easy use of \"corporate\" things like ODBC connections and other things that have historically held tablets back from being useful \"within the business confines\" as well as while traveling. Most other tablets are useful for business people who travel or for uses outside of the corporate confines only. This one is a little different.About the Hardware:I'm extremely impressed with the hardware. Weight to size balance is perfect. Not too heavy nor cheap-feeling. Thin, solid feeling but svelte, good battery life and a bright screen to start with... The aspect ratio is wider than the other tablets in this space but feels good. It never feels warm and just has a good feeling to it, unlike the Nexus 7 which feels too thick for its britches, iPad which can feel a little too heavy for its britches. The charging cable is not a standard micro-USB, but is acceptable.  It's the same high quality stuff I've seen coming out of ASUS lately. The only downside I've detected is the over-advertising that seems to come with Windows based things-- ASUS on the back, Microsoft stickers, etc. Remedied pretty easily with a few moments of peeling.About Windows RT:I first noticed the downsides like finding the MAC address of the tablet so I could authorize it on my wireless Access Point.  All other tablets of the world make MAC address easily available in the section similar to \"about device\". In Windows RT I had to open a command prompt and do the classic \"ipconfig /all\" to find it! When I realized this, I felt like someone had really failed their job. Or as Steve liked to say, _They blew it._ I gave some patience and afterward found myself really exploring the OS and coming to enjoy it.Settings are contextual when in tablet/Metro mode (large tiled screen of squares) and this is very helpful: If you're at the home screen, a right swipe brings you settings, like wireless.  If you're in mail, it brings up mail account settings. If you're in browser, it brings up browser settings. But it's important to realize that the Metro mode tablet UI has an underdpinning of Windows 8-- you can exit this tablet mode and revert to what looks very similar to Windows with a desktop and a start bar-- limited and some things missing.Any time you swipe from the left it's like the rotating task manager-- what did I do last? it comes up. Before that? Another swipe brings that up, continually.So if I had to summarize the usability differences in Android and IOS compared to this: This has a lot more use of all 4 sides of the screen for contextual swipes bringing up settings and actions where Android uses top for notifications and bottom for Google Now, and iOS only uses top for notifications.This device comes pre-loaded with Office preview, which works fine and looks very typically classic office. In the age where my company has gone Google for mail and a lot of collaboration this is still useful when dealing with files from outside the company but not the killer app it once was. From an app store perspective, a lot of the huge expected apps are there for entertainment-- Hulu, Netflix, etc., but the browser seems extremely capable and accurate in rendering.A thing I noticed that made me go \"hmmm\" was the fact that Windows Update works just the same on this tablet... individual updates download, apply, reboots are required.... as opposed to big update packages that hit Android and iOS. Familiar for some, annoying for others.So who is this tablet for? I have to say that it's more for employees who need to work on company business but also may like to still keep access to entertainment and personal contact information while on the go.  From the perspective of someone who is bored with iOS and Android, I found this an interesting useful and enjoyable OS and tablet. I expected to have a 'meh' response, but found myself with a real, 'hmm!' to 'ah!\" response.If you're someone who evaluates hardware or just likes to stay in the know this is certainly worth your time in exploring, especially if you have only read about and never personally experienced Windows RT. If I had to make a key observation about this tablet compared to iPads or Androids, they put personal and entertainment first with a little bit of business, and this one puts business first with a little bit of personal.I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because there are still some weird things that need worked out between deeper settings of Windows requiring you to go into the classic windows mode. They're 90% there in having most needed things in Metro mode, but a few more things that I feel should be finished up.", "Title": "Thumbs Up!", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nino A costarella", "ReviewID": "R3IHRMYOOSVSBZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well lets just say Asus makes a nice product.

I've used it to do presentations already and it works great because of Microsoft Office.First and for most.... Windows RT DOES have adobe flash support.Here are some other PROs I noticed:- USB adapter comes with it.  So even if you can't get the keyboard dock... I plugged my wireless usb dongle into it and was using my full sized keyboard and mouse right away.- Very fast browsing (any one having issues probably has a bad Wi-Fi router)- Battery is excellent- Despite what people said about the speakers they are quite loud.  I don't see what people really can expect out of a tablet it isn't a boom box... but obviously you can't play something in a VERY loud room and expect to hear it.  (use ear buds)- It has a very customizable user interface.  (way more than stock android and iPad)  I didn't even really read anything or look anything up and had it figured out in a day or two... but if you had trouble or aren't very \"tech savvy\" Just watch couple tutorials you can find or read an article on tips and tricks and you'll be a pro by the end of the day.- I heard one person say \"if I have to be taught how to use it than its flawed\"  That is ridiculous... iPad's have a huge learning curve if you are coming from the PC world.  Everything has a learning curve so if you are the type of person that doesn't want to learn than NO tablet is for you... because all of them have things to learn.- The screen is great.  Obviously you shouldn't spend more than 5 hours or so on it but no matter what you were on you could get head aches and eye strain from staring at the same thing for 5 hours.  Even a brick would cause eye strain. CONs:- The camera app is terrible.  It has a lot of settings and stuff I just don't think its easy to use like other devices I've seen but I really don't care because I use my phone to take most pictures anyways...  I think I would look ridiculous trying to take pictures with a 10 inch tablet lol...  and I suspect there will be updates and new apps that take better advantage of this.- You do have to restart it after running some updates every once in a while to keep performance up but it is wise to do this on all tablets and electronic devices anyways it keeps the device running smooth.Hope that helps.", "Title": "There are a lot of strange lies about this tablet and OS", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "Terry D Hardin", "ReviewID": "R1N2CF040DCVJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with every aspect of this product.

Don't buy this product.", "Title": "Don't buy this product", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "Cece", "ReviewID": "R3HW743U602KIM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After working with this tablet for about a week I have mixed feelings about it. All of the following is my opinion and what I have experienced with the particular tablet I purchased and someone else's experience may have been different. For me, on the whole, I think the cons may outweigh the pros for this tablet.Pros:--the battery life is extremely good. I haven't recharged it for the past 3 days and its still going strong. (This is with the keyboard)--Microsoft Office. I'm using the tablet mostly for school and it was a big bonus for me to have Office. However, in order to get the full (not preview) version of office I had to go through a lot of updates and go to the app store and get Windows RT 8.1. If I hadn't done a lot of research I wouldn't have known to do this and would have had to end up paying over $100 for a program I didn't know I already had. Also, if you call customer service they will not tell you to just update your tablet and instead they will try to sell you Office. I am not happy with them for trying to take my money when they didn't need to.--Price. One of the cheapest 10 in tablets on the market.--Touchpad. Many people have complained about the touchpad on the keyboard but I enjoy not having to reach up to the screen everytime I want to click something.--32 GB. This leaves plenty of room for me, HOWEVER, half most of the space is already taken up by programs on the tablet so it only leaves you with about 12 GB for personal use. This is plenty for me but may not be for some people.--weight. Its not a very heavy tablet even with the keyboard.Cons:--app store. The only place to get apps is the Windows app store which has a VERY limited supply of apps.--touch screen. Sometimes the touchscreen is completely unresponsive. I've tapped on links that the touchscreen did not respond to so I had to end up using the keyboard's touchpad. This is pathetic.--cramped keyboard. The keyboard is very cramped and my hands will hurt after I've been typing a while. However, you do have to consider that this is a tablet NOT a desktop so things will be smaller and more cramped.--internet explorer. IE is slow and I've never liked it. You cannot download other programs like google chrome or firefox. This is a huge downside for me.--keyboard dock. The physical connection between the tablet and keyboard is very hit and miss and sometimes they do not stay attached on one of the sides. However, they do communicate smoothly and there aren't the glitches that a Bluetooth keyboard has.--speakers. It may just be the one I got but my speakers keep making a popping sound when I turn the volume up high. Also, even when the volume is up as loud as it goes it's still not very loud.--programs. There are many programs that this tablet simply will not download (e.g. Spotify).--location of headphone jack. Perhaps this is nitpicking but the headphone jack is in an awkward place especially if you are using the keyboard because then the headphone wire will be draping down from the top of the tablet to your ear.--ports. The only port that I find useful is the USB which is only in the keyboard. If I want to plug anything into the tablet itself I'm out of luck. There's not even a micro USB.--music player. It's awkward and is hard to figure out how to use. I wish they would just give us Windows Media Player.--camera. The camera quality is bad. Photos come out blurry and unclear in almost every shot.--desktop icons. I have yet to find a way to put icons on my desktop. Maybe this is a windows 8 thing and I missed the memo but I'm still not happy with it.--screen resolution. You can see the pixels!

Onto the tablet, I would say it is pretty good for the price. The only problem I have is with the sound. It seems as though the sound wavers from low to high randomly. I believe it is a product issue so I hope to get that fixed soon. Other than that, the touch works great. The only thing is that there aren't much apps available in the store so you will have to keep it pretty simplistic.I hate how Asus says that a free dock comes with purchase (which I got at the windows store). The store didn't have any docks left but they said I could apply for one online. Done it awhile already but Asus has still not responded on the status of the keyboard. The most ridiculous thing is that you have to cut out the serial to get the keyboard yet when you don't get the keyboard you can't return the Vivo anymore.

Mainly what convinced me to get this was because of a couple friends who have older model ASUS tablets and sing nothing but praise for theirs, and the offer of a free dock helped.  Ordered the tablet early December and it arrived in a timely manner.  Used the link on Amazon to go to the ASUS VIP site to register the tablets and apply for the \"free docking station\".  On 25 Dec an email was sent that the registered serial numbers were not eligible for the \"free docking station\".  On 27 Dec ASUS shipped one (1) docking station which arrived early Jan.On 4 Jan I called ASUS support and spoke with Frank who told me 1) the email I received was incorrect and that my tablets were eligible for the docking stations, 2) that ASUS had run short on packing materials and to call back after a week if I still had not received it, and 3) he was escalating my case and someone would contact me within 1-2 days.  A week later, no dock and no call.On 11 Jan I called and talked with Daniel who said that I probably had not received the dock because it was still within the five week window.  I asked to speak with a supervisor but Daniel stated that none were available.  He further said he would escalate my case and I would get a call back within 1-2 days.  Yet again NO call and STILL no dock.On 18 Jan I called and spoke with Fabian who actually did transfer me to a supervisor.  After waiting on hold for about 45 minutes I finally spoke with Andrei who informed me that he would have to contact the \"Main Office\" to find out what was going on.  \"Would you mind holding?\"  With no other real option, I went back onto hold, off hold, on hold, then off hold.  Andrei informed the `Main Office said' I would have to contact MicroCenter since the tablets had been sold to them.  He also informed me the `Main Office' had no record of any dock being sent to me (even though I have the box, from ASUS, which the dock arrived in).  Since ASUS is not showing a record of any dock being sent to me, would it be wrong if I still demanded two?  I try my best to be an honest person so I just want my other dock.I called MicroCenter corporate office and spoke with Sean who informed me that I would have to deal with Amazon since the purchase was made through them.  I then contacted Amazon (spoke with a rep who did not want to give me her name or operator #) and was informed by the nameless rep that I would have to contact DEALCITI because that is who the table was actually ordered from.  She said she would `escalate' my issue and at least I received an email from Amazon verifying that.But wait, there's more.My son returned from a weekend trip and informed me his tablet was `glitching out.'  It is slow to respond, zooms in/out with just a finger touch, little bubble looking things hang out at the edges, screen will jump around by itself, etc..  I am also noticing a lack of response from the touch screen of mine at times so I'm not sure if that is just quirky or an indicator of coming issues.I really like the ASUS products I have used and have never had an issue with them until this absolutely, beyond terrible customer assistance issue dealing with these tablets.  So here is how I'm interpreting things; either Amazon lied and made a promise that someone could not keep; or ASUS made a promise it later realized it could not keep; or when you add up piss poor customer service and lower production standards it equals a company maybe on the downturn.I'm on the edge of sending both tablets back and going with something else so feedback from others is appreciated.  I feel as if I have been lied to and scammed by Amazon and ASUS.  The real challenge will be sending back the dock which, according to ASUS `Main Office' was never sent to me.  The three plus hours of hold time with ASUS I'll just chalk up to the life of hard knocks.

Tablets are getting there but I doubt will have the true functionality as a true desktop computer or laptop. Mind you the Pro version of this tablet will be close as a replacement as you can get and the surface pro.  That being said the Asus VivoTab RT is more of a pc companion or addition to your laptop or desktop.What I use it for:  Taking notes in school (with the dock add-on)(Haven't received yet) However it is Much better than the surface, gives extended battery power, great for productivity unlike the surface floppy soft keyboard which costs the same amount (although I got my dock free through Asus's Dock Claim) It is also great for music and movies. Although as far as the screen goes Apple beats almost every tablet out there on screen resolution!  However that being said  I think that will change as the price fixing on OLED screens and such gets ironed out, as Apple seems to have some type of agreement that gives them a cheap supply monopoly on high end monitors from manufacturer abroad.  Although Apple Ipad has a higher resolution I really don't look at this screen and say it sucks, thus far I haven't really been able to tell a difference between Apples High Res Screen and Asus VivoTab HD screen.This tablet truly is the best one, I might of gotten the surface if it wasn't for the free dock claim that expires on the 31'st of January 2013, however I am glad that I went with Asus anyway.  On Consumer reports it tied at a an overall score with 83 points with the newest 4th Gen Apple I-pad.  In my opinion the Asus VivoTab BLOWS away the apple Ipad,  The Apple Ipad seems overally limited and simplistic with the apple IOS.However that being said, the Windows RT takes a bit of time getting use to and memorizing the required gestures to use it.  Supposedly Microsoft says it is easier to learn than windows 7.. personally for elderly people and other electronic illiterate people it will be more complicated (haven't tested just presuming)The fact that this has a HDMI Out, a full size USB (using usb dongle) or when using dock full USB slot on keyboard, NFC to transfer music with other NFC enabled devices sets it miles apart from the Ipad.  Also having Microsoft office 2013 pre-loaded is awesome for productivity as far as taking notes or writing papers. (I'd probably kill myself if I had to do a report on it though) as i'm usually use to dual monitors on my desktop computer and 24 inch screens.In the end, it's not a PC(Desktop)(Laptop) replacement and I never expected it to be because it's a tablet.  (IF you want a laptop desktop replacement and a tablet like device, look into the Lenovo Yoga laptop or the Asus Haichi, it's a laptop tablet, pretty sweet.) Anyways it takes more learning than a simple apple Ipad but the Vivo has far more features and abilities than an Ipad.I wish there were more options for screen protectors and cases.. considering it is a fairly new product I presume more will be available as we continue along.Good luck choosing (Check out consumer reports tablets)P.S RT is not full windows and is tablet / phone OS, however it looks and feels like windows 8 and has identical features (Just different programs aka \"apps\") Way better than Apple iOS and android OS at the moment.

The tablet feels high quality in your hand.  The 8MP rear facing camera is clear and images are good though a bit underexposed.  The forward facing camera is average.The docking keyboard is a nice idea.  It allows the tablet to function almost like a laptop.  It has one full size USB port ( I think it's only 2.0)  and battery life docked is stated at something like 9 hours though I will believe it when I see it.  Outstanding for a laptop but not so much so for a tablet.  The keyboard is small with island style keys that are recessed into the dock unit.  You get a full 6 rows of keys that have fair feedback.  The touchpad is horrible.  Appears to be only 2 finger touch capable so it may not support all the new Win8 apps.  The touchpad feels cheap and had an audible click when you press it down, except for along the top where is not press enabled.As far as I can tell from my initial testing the TF600T running Win8 RT running on a Tegra3 processor with 2GB ram is a REAL DOG!!!I ran a set of 20 windows updates and it took better than an hour just to apply them after they were downloaded.  If you plan on using this toy for anything more than simple web browsing and the occasional streaming video I would suggest you look for a real laptop.  At this price-point you are into i3 or i5 laptop UltraBook range.  You are paying a premium price for the bragging rights of having the first RT box on the block.

I called Amazon back Monday afternoon about 3pm, 45 minutes later (this is the frustration point)I had to ask for a supervisor to complete the return and replacement because the rep could not understand that I was NOT at home and did not want to leave a $600 item out where it could be stolen, and certainly did NOT want UPS to leave a $600 item out when they sent the replacement.

Frequently, the mouse pointer/cursor will appear in the upper lefthand corner of the touchscreen, where it remains stuck, for a few seconds, or for a few minutes, and sometimes the only way to get rid of it is to exit whatever screen you are in (and sometimes there will even be two (2) mouse pointers on the screen - the one you are using to type or click with, and the one stuck in the upper lefthand corner of the screen) ; 2. frequently, the screen freezes or shakes (slightly up and down), or the tablet is extremely slow to respond when using the touchpad to go from one window to another or to scroll; 3. frequently, when trying to use the touchscreen to 'scroll', the tablet will respond by reducing or magnifying the screen you are in, instead of scrolling  (my VivoTab did not exhibit this problem during its first three (3) weeks); 4. frequently, the screen will click by itself and go to another screen, even if you have not touched anything on the screen or touched anything on the optional keyboard.I do not know if the above problems are hardware or software related. I do know that other buyers of the VivoTab, as well as owners of previous ASUS tablet models, have, or still are, suffering from the above problems. Some buyers of the VivoTab, on this and other forums, have reported a poorly fitting or loose touchscreens; perhaps that is the cause of the above problems (although my touchscreen seems to be OK). In any case, I have tried completely re-intalling Windows RT and this did not help with these touchscreen problems. I have also made sure the settings are at original factory settings and that the touchscreen is clean - all to no avail. ASUS has not issued any statement with regards to this problem and, in fact, refuses to acknowledge it or, if possible, issue a software or firmware update.Because the above problems happen frequently, but not always, good luck shipping-in your VivoTab for service, because chances are the service center will claim it cannot repeat the problem (after looking at the unit for five (5) minutes) and then they'll send your unit back to you. Meanwhile, you incur shipping fees and the bill for the diagnsostic test of your tablet.In addition to the touchscreen problems, there is the matter of ASUS customer service. First, they advertised a free keyboard which they did not actually have. Then there is the issue of their website, which for a computer company, is a disaster. There is not even a dedicated forum for VivoTab at ASUS support services, nevermind any announcements by ASUS regarding technical support issues.I hope that the launch of VivoTab is just related to the fact that ASUS used poor judgment by releasing the VivoTab prematurely, in order to compete with the release of Windows Surface. At least, up until now, I have read many positive reviews, and in Consumer Reports no less, concerning ASUS quality.

Luckily it was within the time I could return it to Amazon. I was disappointed in that I liked the device and there aren't really any good alternatives to Surface. It's too bad they had to update it and ruin it.UPDATE:Asus would have fixed the problem, by all accounts. The only reason I didn't pursue this option is because I was in the return window for Amazon, there were other options, and I saw other instances of firmware updates gone bad on the Asus. I've since been using a Dell XPS 10 but I would say the Asus is the best of the RT options. I almost bought another a few days ago to load 8.1 preview on it, but the wife wisely thinks buying another RT device only months before I'll want a Surface 2.0 is silly, so...I keep using the Dell.

Generally an early adopter of new technology, but have slowed a step on that with windows ME, Windows Vista and PDA experience.Secondly.. do a bit of research and understand the difference between Windows 8 RT (pure tablet OS) and Windows 8 (PC OS that does touch screen and will have tablet like hardware).I currently have 2 month old Android TF700t and as the family was pushing for a second tablet I went with the Windows 8 (Windows RT to be more accurate) VIVOTAB from Asus so I could check out the MS offering.It runs smooth and slick and feels more polished than Android.Important things to know:-Does not run windows apps - there is MS office for Win RT  but it does not run full processor apps (I knew this)-No VPN 3rd party (yet anyway) -there is basic VPN, but does not connect with CISCO (most corporate) This is a killer for me since no immediate productivity and neither Cisco or MS is talking resolution -  search for windows RT fatal flaw article-Apps are coming I'm sure but for now.. not even a Facebook, twitter or GMail app - Another issue for immediate productivity-Learning curve is tough with no real manual and there are very little (how to) articles on netAfter a few auto updates... The wifi adapter no longer works and control panel says there is an issue with the driver.. I am not planning to struggle through issue and return unit to BB.  The build seems less solid than my TF700t and the screen resolution is much lower as well.Since we do have a GREAT android tab now.. I will hold off on a second tab for a while to see where Windows RT tabs are and assuming the bugs are worked out and there are more apps (including VPN apps)I will probably give Windows RT another shotBased on where windows RT is right now, the lower build quality than past Asus Tabs, lesser screen res and current bugs.. I am going 3 stars anyway because I feel Windows RT is actually smoother than Android.

It turns out no one in the USA can sell the digitizer screen, and my only option was to call up for an out of warranty repair and mail it in.

The screen size and aspect ratio did not leave much viewing space and the resolution, while typical for most Windows 8 tablets at this point was absolutely terrible.  More importantly the price of the tablet leaves a lot to be desired.  It is $599 without the docking station.  From what I can gather the keyboard will cost an additional $150, bringing the total to $750.  The very next day I returned it to BestBuy and ordered the Surface with the type cover (which I am typing this review on right now).  There is absolutely no comparison between the two.  The Surface's build quality blows the Vivo out of the water.  While it shares the same resolution with the Vivo the clarity and black levels are far better.  The Surface is only .5 inches larger, however the aspect ratio of the Surface provides a much better viewing experience.

I came to find out that the product I bought was originally purchased from Microsoft then resold by a third party reseller here on Amazon, so Asus therefore refuses to stand by their policy and advertising to give out a keyboard dock. This isn't my responsibility! Amazon is quick to make their buck, Asus is quick to make their buck, Microsoft is quick to make their buck, and the reseller is too devious to properly advertise the fact they bought the item from an authorized retailer and just throwing everything back to Asus, who throws everything back to all the other parties. These people are lowlife greedy scumbags. This review will probably never get published because it contains the truth. How is the actual product? On a scale of one to ten, it's a solid eight. The operating system needs to be better supported and marketed. Just remember you are limited to applications in the Microsoft App store. It isn't so bad. 95% of what you buy something like this can be done on this tablet. I still think they should just give everybody the damn keyboard dock like they promised however. Typical Chinese manufacturer selling in the United States and skirting our UCC and warranty laws. You need a good unified media player with Windows 8 RT.

Anyway, they (Microsoft) will manage to mess up a great thing here one way or another (Like I said typical)and not get enough of a development and user community for their products and related products (Like this VIVOTAB RT).So, in the end regardless of the price you're taking a big chance. Now, this honest evaluation isn't in my best interest, I own the product, I want to see it and Windows 8 RT succeed. But, after using computers and technology for over 30 years I know how these greed mongers think. So, you buy at your own risk. Please don't ever be so stupid or naive enough to believe these companies give a rat's behind about you. They don't. And they could honestly care less about the actual product.

Been Trying for hours to connect to the internet and I am very able. It sees the WIFI and connects just will not let me get further, says limited. I have about 3+ hours into this and I am going crazy, Asus I love but this is not right. Everything else works fine. Now that I have more time on the tablet I like it but just no WIFI and I have set up whole networks so I am not new to this. The opening screen/user says Test and the desktop has about 6 testing shortcuts for programs I have never seen before so I am wondering what happened? The screen is fantastic and I wish I could use some apps, going down to see I can swap out. I will report back with what happens. I am the 10% that have an issue on their tablet and I would say if you are a PC user buy this over any android system because Windows 8 is fast and made for the tablet.", "Title": "WIFI not working correctly", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B009F1INL8", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
