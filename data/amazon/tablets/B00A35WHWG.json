Additionally the screen has several high contrast spots. It appears to be a quality control problem. The functioning of the tablet overall is good but the visual defects are a problem. Maybe I was unlucky and my QC guy was having a bad day when my tablet passed through his hands.", "Title": "Good tablet for the price  BUT  has some Quality Control issues", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00A35WHWG", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
