Got mine as an addition to my 2012 Nexus 7 because I wanted a larger screen.  This tablet compares pretty well to the first generation Nexus.  Speed and screen resolution are about the same and the larger screen on the Dell is easier on the eyes.  Many of the criticisms you read on other reviews are accurate: touchscreen sensitivity, headphone volume, battery life, etc.  It's not perfect.  But, the issues are relatively minor, especially since the price is so low (got mine on sale after Christmas).  I did get the update to 4.3, but there are a couple of video apps that still won't work: HBOGo and CNN.  Even so, this tablet has become my daily driver and I think it's an excellent value for the money I paid.  I really like having the microSD card slot, too.The tablet I got for my wife is her first Android device.  Until now, she was strictly a \"fruit\" tablet/phone user.  She uses her Dell every day now.  She does miss the screen resolution of her iPad, but she likes the size of the Dell and has no other complaints about this tablet.  I see her using it more than her iPad around the house now.Pros: price, 8\" screen, microSD slot, speed, bright screen, 4.3 updateCons: mediocre battery, occasional touchscreen issues, headphone volume could be higher", "Title": "Excellent value", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Danny V", "ReviewID": "R4VTW22G6RRE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow I have had my Venue for  few weeks now and I love it. I am replacing a first generation iPad that slowed down to a crawl. In the first few days of owning this,my first Android device, all of my iTunes music was transfered to Google Play and I found every app that I needed for productivity. S a good size and much lighter than my old tablet. I like it that I can buy a 32G micro SD card to put all my movies on while my tablet is free to use its onboard memory to run apps.

The build quality feels great and the apps run smoother than my high end smart phones.  So even at the full retail price i think the Venue 8 is a solid buy.  However, there are some downsides to it and you need to decide if they matter to you or not.Cons:* USB charging port is in a spot that makes it difficult to charge if you are using a cover.* Dell disabled multiple user profiles* Battery life is sub-par - but still acceptable and not worthy of complaint unless you're a very heavy user* Internal speaker could not handle highest volume without serious distortion.The decision on if this is the right tablet for you is really based on what you need it for.  I primarily user it for a couple hours in the evening to read, research, shop, or play a simple game.  So the cons listed above are not deal breakers for me.

I find 8 inches to be the perfect size. I will compare it to the original Nexus 7. It's basically the same, just as good as, the Nexus. However, internet is a bit faster - did my own side by side comparison. It has a camera, and although not a great camera, it's fine for taking pics of docs with camscanner, which is what I needed. It is just as responsive, maybe more so, then the Nexus.A couple of things to help older people due to the size. Go to settings, open accessibility, and change text to huge. Then open chrome and go to settings. Open advanced settings and play with text size. I mainly use my tablets for reading news, so the above was crucial for making reading pleasant.There are other tablets in this size that are better, but more expensive. I really wanted to buy from a US owned company, so this was it for under 200 bucks.I also have a second gen iPad, and reading on this is just as easy. We also bought a cheapie 99 dollar tablet from Walmart called a Nextbook, which is actually quite zippy, but not so great resolution, so this is way better than that.All in all, while it doesn't blow me away, I am happy with it. Perfect size for travel and reading the news. I watched some videos and it didn't stall or anything, but I don't use  tablets to watch movies so can't compare.

The venue has serious power and does not lag. The camera is really good in the right lighting. The Intel processor is really the reason I love this thing its so smooth. Running the latest in android. Running better than any touchscreen device I ever owned. I have had this product for 1 month but it seems like a very well built piece of hardware. No issues at all. I really can't see how Samsung can charge so much. Dell kills them with This tablet. Giving you a speedy device with a very bright and clear screen. The resolution is well more than adequate. Apple also is a crock charging as much as they do....but I won't get into that. I have used the Samsung galaxy tabs. Sorry not worth the over pricing.Overall, if you my friend are looking for a tablet.....here is your answer. I may buy the next generation of this when it comes out. It does mostly everything you need, and I expanded with a 16 gig micro SD. I use nothing else to web browse very smooth. For me opening apps is flawless. Using Intel may put this thing over the top. So fast. The WiFi works perfectly. Intel atom 2.0 GHz. Its just the fasted loading tablet ever. It pops on so fast. Holds a charge forever. This thing is as close to perfect as it gets without a super amold screen(whatever).Dell made a great tablet.", "Title": "NICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Author": "Kelsey", "ReviewID": "R3V8HXMA9OKIGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I had some Christmas money left over and really wanted a new tablet after being completely fed up with my Kindle Fire HD. I really wanted an iPad mini, but didn't have that amount of money sitting around and really couldn't wait to save up another $200. So I originally was going to purchase a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 because of the excellent price point, but decided against it after reading multiple bad reviews. I thought I was going to be stuck with nothing more than my iPod touch 5th gen for apps until I found this in my list of suggested items. I really couldn't be more pleased with this tablet. First of all, amazon has amazingly fast shipping, because this arrived 2 days early!! Upon opening the box, I noticed that this tablet has a really, really sharp design. The front looks like an iPad mini without the home button. The back has a nice finish that is soft to the touch. Kind of attracts finger prints, but that isn't a problem if you pair it up with a case like I did (I recommend Poetic's black leather folding case, really sharp and fits like a glove). The battery life is okay, but you definitely won't get 10 hours out of it like you would an iPad. But let's be honest, you are spending less than $200 on a tablet. Should you expect to get 10 hours of continuous use out of it? No way. I'm really liking the screen size too. Not too big, but not too little either. The 8 inch is definitely the way to go as far as I'm concerned. The screen is sharp and very easy to read on. I've had this for about a week now, and couldn't be happier with it.

The rubberized coating also has a premium product feel to it.I'd like to note that being 8 inches is probably the best thing about the device. It's perfectly small, perfectly large.

I mainly use this for Netflix, Hulu Plus and basic games like Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds. I have not had any problems running them. I am not really interested in the high end games for tablets, but did download one to see how it would run. If you are looking to play high end games,  I suggest paying the extra for the latest Google Nexus 7.Here is a list of things I like about this. I like having the extra inch for the screen. The tablet fits comfortably in my hands. While not as vibrant as the newer tablets, the HD screen is still nice looking. I can run multiple apps at once with no problems thanks to the 2GB of RAM. The micro sdhc slot lets you store files so you are not bogging down the tablet's on board memory.To drop the price, Dell had to cut some corners. The cameras are of poor quality. While certainty functional, the OS is a couple of generations behind. The one speaker is okay at best, but you could always use headphones or bluetooth speakers. The battery is a disappointment. I can get about four hours of life while streaming, or playing games.I am actually returning this tablet because of a defect in the micro USB port. The housing for it is loose, the plug for the cord fits loosely, and often, it will not charge the battery because of this. I did not factor this in to my rating as this could be a one time problem.

Lag only happens when the game server has a bad connection or slow internet connection. Plus, it has good graphic rendering too. Another reason why this game doesn't lag is due to the ram. Since this game uses a huge amount of ram, you will need those extra spaces to run it.It upgrades to the newest android version by itself. So currently, I have the 4.4.2 KitKat version.

So I tried a moist q-tip with my finger touching the cotton wool, pretty darn smooth and precise. Next I tried an old nylon #1 (small tip) paint brush holding on to the nickel ferrel -- amazing!! So in my opinion, the problem is the stylus.I've ordered a Pineapple fiber-tip stylus; if that doesn't work, I'll figure out how to fabricate one and start selling them on Amazon.Back to the tablet. I think it is great value for the money. I bought the 32g version and installed a 32g memory card, and a case (get the one made for this tablet). It charges in a reasonable amount of time and lasts 6 hrs +/- I keep the charger handy and plug it in when in standby; I power it down when not in use.I haven't tried the voice commands or dictation; I'll probably not use that feature, just feels weird talking to a computer.So there you have it; I'd highly recommend it (5 stars).", "Title": "Great value and impressive little gadget", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "jamie oxenreider", "ReviewID": "R2R5QU9HQ45TRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little bigger a little faster and good build quality, very good for the money.

First off this tablet is fast. It also is capable of performing well even when you have numerous apps running at the same time. It is a very slim tablet with a large 8\" screen. The border is very small which gives you even more viewing area. It seem much larger than my older 7\" tablet. The screen resolution is decent for a tablet that costs less than $200. The Dell Venue has large internal storage capabilities. It sports 32 GB of on board storage which allows you to download many apps to your device. There is no need to worry about running out of space. I found that if you put too many apps on a device with lower storage capabilities it tends to run very slow and sluggish. This tablet does have an external SD storage slot. This helps to eliminates having to store music, videos and pictures on the device itself. One area that could be improved on this tablet are the speakers. This is not the best tablet to buy if you plan on listening to a lot of loud music without headphones or external powered speakers. The speakers are a little weak. The only other area I would improve on is adding a HDMI port so you could hook it up to a TV and be able watch your videos and movie. I solved this problem by adding an app that just throws the video to the TV with no wires. I have tried many tablets under $200 and found this tablet to have the best features for the money. I would not think twice about buying or recommending this tablet. Look for specials and you can find this Dell for a lot less than $200. I choose this over the Dell Venue Pro because I already have a laptop that runs Windows and I wanted to run on Android. This tablet runs on Android 4.3 so it is still very current.

It has lots of pros but it's also got a significant con.The screen is top quality, the built in speaker sound is great (thin, but detailed), the installed OS and software is very light (almost no bloatware) and it runs every app perfectly from demanding games to handling tons of apps concurrently. There's no hint of any issue being an Intel instead of ARM processor. It would be a dream tablet, and a great value buy, except for...Battery Life:Battery life is not so good. I see 2 and half days from a full charge with very light usage, and 1 and a half days from moderate usage (browsing/e-mail). It's not awful, but it is the lowest of all the tablets I've used before.Firstly:Woah, this is one heavy tablet... with case it weighs over a pound. Did they use cast iron instead of aluminum inside? It's not too comfortable to use in-hand. It needs a surface for extended use.Secondly:As other reviews have pointed out, there are issues with the touch/sensitivity. The touch is a mess, or botched by the manufacturer. I've used Archos and Samsung tablets for years and, compared to those, the touch on this tablet is less responsive and less accurate. Random zooms, reacting incorrectly for short or long touch, not registering touches at all. I spend a lot of time clicking repeatedly , re-clicking, un-zooming, and having to remember how to hold your finger at just right and angle, and use just the right amount of force and hold for so long is pain. If I though this an issue with me I'd say so, but it's seems a widespread issue for users in reviews.UPDATE. I've been working on the touch response problem for a few days and can report some success. Using a diagnostic app I could see the false touch registering. Making the touch less sensitive seems to have been the fix by the manufacturer. The tablet needs fat & flat (more than I'm used to) touch from users to compensate, but this makes aiming trickier. Increasing the sensitivity by removing my screen protector made a notable improvement... your mileage will vary depending on protector. Taken out of a case, the responsive improvement was slight. As Dell suggests, a reset helps to resolve touch issues, but doesn't fix them completely. I suggest buyers do that first thing after the out-of-box update, and hunt down and disable any unused custom gestures in apps.Despite the great value, solid build quality, the internal hardware and software performance, the touch is still the worst I've ever used, but its workable.

Every time I turn it on the battery is dead.  I thought I'd try turning it off completely, rather than let it go into sleep mode.  I just turned it on and the battery is drained.  It seems all I can do is charge it and it takes a long time to charge, compared to my other android devices.  I called Dell support and was more or less told the battery behavior I was experiencing was normal.  I have an older Asus that at least works all the time.  The battery lasts for days and it recharges quickly.  I've hardly even used the Dell because I can't use it when there is no juice in the battery.
