I sold my iPad to a friend several months back, and decided after a while that I would like to have a tablet again. I started comparing the newer generation iPads to some Android devices, and this one got me hooked. The interface is both streamlined but customizable, and the hardware itself puts Apple to shame. You are paying a premium not for the Sony name (though I personally think that would be worth it) but for the high-performance hardware on this device. I use it regularly to watch 1080p movies while in flight, to stream Netflix, to read from the Kindle app, and to play games. Multitasking is a breeze, and the battery holds up well. I am so glad to have dumped Apple in favor of this. Also, my roommate just purchased an iPad Air, and the Xperia Z tablet is STILL thinner than that.

Comparing Video, Camera etc I have to say the Sony is much better. I bought the Sony for my daughter to be used in school as my IPAD is more expensive. However I like the Sony much better and I gave the IPAD to her. I have compared HD videos side by side and even though the IPAD technically has a higher resolution I found the Sony to be better. The new IPAD Air has the same display as mine so I am glad I didn't by the latest IPAD Air. The Sony is much thinner and very light wait (almost unbelievable). And it's water proof!

This tablet finally did it.  It is amazingly thing, thinner than my phone.  The Sony skin over Android is actually very nice and unlike TouchWiz does not immediately make me wish I had a stock Android interface.  The waterproof works, though I have to admit I have very little use for this feature.  The device is fast and responsive - I have yet to be able to stress it even with higher end 3D games.

And it is simply, splendid.The good:Just as advertised, this tablet is VERY thin and yet the great build quality makes it feel nevertheless solid and durable. I have checked the waterproof ability and it seems to be pretty impressive. After staying 10 minutes under water(dare not to risk it for 30 min..), everything still works perfectlyOne reason I chose this Android tablet over iPad is its design. Having been a fan of SONY product for years, I always love how delicate and beautiful the SONY-style is, and this design style is undoubtedly adopted by Tablet Z. Call me superficial if you want, but the design of a product, AKA its aesthetic value, is really a big deal to me. Surely, I am not saying that iPad is ugly by any means; it is just a personal preference.This tablet runs on Android 4.1.2 and the user experience is overall satisfactory. Not as smooth as iOS, but it does nor lag very often. Its S4 Pro processor is relatively powerful but I will be happier if it is Snapdragon 800.The not so good:Speakers. Yes, I know how SONY brags about its speaker performance in the ads, but it turned out to be a little disappointing. The sound is totally not loud enough and its quality is not comparable to Note 10.1.Screen is okay but PPI needs to be higher. The display offered by tablet Z is not bad, but the relatively low PPI sometimes can make the pictures seem to be pixelated. I would definitely be more satisfied if it can reach retina level.=========================================ConclusionXperia Tablet Z by SONY is absolutely worth trying.

There is some glare, but if you can position it to avoid glare, you can see the screen just fine outside.*Waterproof - if you use this in the kitchen for a recipe book, you don't have to worry about getting stray liquids or other ingredients on it - or you can read in the bathtub without worrying about dropping it in the water!*Stereo Speakers - nice quality - not perfect, but for a tablet, they are better than most*MicroSD Card expansion*NFC*Media Server DLNA capability*Android upgrade to 4.3 in December 2013, and 4.4 down the road in 2014 have been confirmed by SonyCons:*Battery - this is probably my biggest gripe about this tablet.  With consistent heavy use, it will last about 6-7 hours depending on the activity.  It also doesn't charge very quickly.  I understand that this is a trade-off in order to get such a thin, light tablet.  For me, I'm OK with this, but for others who are more concerned with battery life over the size and weight, this may not be the best choice.*Screen is not made of \"Gorilla Glass\" or other similar glass.  It is a nice quality tempered glass, but to help with the strength, Sony has applied a shatterproof coating.  This coating is horrible with collecting fingerprints, and I'm also afraid that it may scratch over time.  I have gotten an ArmorShield screen protector for this reason.  I'm happy with it, but I wish it wasn't necessary.Summary:Other than a few minor complaints, this is a very solid tablet, and I'm extremely happy with my choice.*Also, I have seen some other reviews mentioning some Wi-Fi issues, but I have not experienced them myself.

It's amazing how thin this thing is, yet it feels like it has a very solid construction. I'm not at all worried about breaking it. It's very fast. I haven't yet seen a game or app in the few months that I've had it that has caused it to lag or show signs that the performance may be lacking. The screen is really sharp, and the colors are bright.My 15\" laptop is about 3 years old now and doesn't really allow for ease of use in multiple locations (kitchen, living room, bedroom). The battery is starting to age as well, so it's not a great option for longer travel or flights. I wanted to get a tablet that could provide media streaming and web browsing in a more portable form factor. What I found was that the Tablet Z has almost completely replaced my laptop with the exception of 1 or 2 functions...basically just iTunes for my old iPod video and PC gaming.For me, Sony's reputation for making solid products that are worth the price has fallen quite a bit in recent years. But for the money, I think that the Tablet Z has really delivered in terms of performance and quality. If you're in the market for an Android tablet, I don't think it gets much better than this.Pros:- Fast- 16GB of storage is more than enough- Great image/video quality- Thin and light, yet feels durable- Battery life is exactly what I needCons:- Remote control functionality really doesn't get used- It takes a while to fully charge the battery- Not a fan of port covers, but that's why it's waterproof- Speakers are placed on the sides, meaning that you need to cup your hands on the bottom edges in landscape mode to really hear anything", "Title": "A really solid Android Tablet", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "GORDON R CARTER", "ReviewID": "R1CJ5B283JKZC3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good & nice & light & don't have to worry about water, dust etc. watching movies & music nice & crisp", "Title": "Wonderful", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "elizabeth", "ReviewID": "RR6ZFDXMQ5X94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE IT, its a great tablet will recommend to everyone.

The build material is the best on the market. Thin, light and solid. Water proof is a plus. At first, it seemed to perform flawlessly. My first reaction was it will be a keeper. Even at the high price.However, after using it for some time, some deal breaking flaws starting to show themselves.First, the tablet seems to have a wifi issue. The included android email program could not stay connected to servers. Anytime I attempted to read an email, I would get the can't connect to server messge. Sometimes I could manage reading 1 email. Then when I click on the next one, I would get the message. If I closed the program and tried again, sometimes I could read the next message. Not being able to read emails is a huge problem.Next, this tablet had a battery issue. In reading all the reviews, both here on Amazon, and on the internet, I could not find any bad reviews about the battery.  So this leaves me to belive it was just  my unit. With just the wifi on, (bluetooth and GPS turned off) surfing or watching a video or playing a 'not so intensive' game, the battery would last maybe 4 hours. And even with the charger plugged in, the battery level still dropped while using it.Then for the last problem, while using the tablet with the charger plugged in, the screen would randomly start acting irractic. When touching the screen, it would flash or apps would suddenly start opening like someone was touching these apps all at the same time. Unplugging the charger would stop this behavior.I guess I could have lived with the odd behavior of the screen and bad battery life if the price of the unit was not so high. But the constant email issue was a definate deal breaker. So I reluctantly decided to return it.Had none of these issues been present, I would gladly had given this 5 stars. Any other tablet would get 1 star based on these issues.

I may have to find a non reflective screen protector, when I use it in the field.", "Title": "Even better then I had expected!", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Author": "Gail Pace \"Ronnie\"", "ReviewID": "R35JFIPBB5XY0R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While I cannot complain about the usability and performance of this tablet, the 2 major gripes that I have with it is its power consumption and taking forever to charge. This tablet is as good a performer is any tablet in the market hands down. I don't have problems with it freezing up while playing games or watching videos. It works awesome with my Bluetooth keyboard, which I purchased separately for $12 and I am able to type long documents in the purchased version of Office. So, my productivity is exactly what I wanted and what I expected.The problem with this tablet is that it consumes so much power that the OEM charger cannot keep up with it. This is a design flaw that Sony is very aware of (see their support forums), unfortunately, nobody is addressing it.  Honestly, they tend to make it the user's fault or incompetence. I have found that purchasing a high-end 2 amp charger helps a great deal, but not always. This thing is a power hog. Additionally, Sony says that it takes 5 hours from complete discharge to full charge. It has been my experience to be as much a 7 or 8 using the OEM charger, especially if left on standby. It does charge a little faster with the power off.I strongly recommend to anyone purchasing this tablet, to buy several OEM cords, because the micro USB connectors do not hold up very well and seem to fail quite often. I have had this unit for 4 months and I have gone through 4 USB cables. I don't move this around and I typically lay it on my desk or on my nightstand at home so it is not like it is going through abuse with the court attached. I will say that I have dropped this unit a couple occasions and it has been very durable without scratches, nick's or cuts to the screen. While never dropped \"hard,\" it still scared me, but it worked just fine without any problems so I think I can say it is a very durable unit as well.With all that being said, I would love to give this tablet 5 stars because it deserves it BUT, the charging issues and power drainage leave me not trusting it away from a wall socket for very long. For instance, on a daylong trip in a couple of airplanes, you are going to have 3 to 4 hours of use. 2 to 3 hours, if you are watching videos. When you get off the plane, you have to find a power outlet, and if the power has drained significantly, if you want to use it on your next 2 hour flight, you better power it down and leave it plugged in for a 4-5 hr layover, otherwise, you're flat out of luck.  Plugging it into a dc outlet will definitely not keep it charged either.  I do love the Sony Xperia Z tablet, and I can highly recommend it, if they would just fix these power issues.", "Title": "Excellent tab, put really bad charging issues", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "dmc", "ReviewID": "R1TJQSJS17WYYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first, it is 20$ cheaper in Amazon, but Sony is giving a charging cradle.

Very light and thin.  Chose it because I boycott all Apple products and I liked the waterproof design; we can live at ease even as it is laying surrounded by coffee cups and water glasses.  I will note that the battery life is nothing amazing AND charging time is pretty slow.  I've allowed it to charge overnight and wake to discover it is still hasn't reached 100%.  Battery life will vary depending on the app that you're using; if it kills you phone then expect it to kill the tablet.Other than that it's a sweet tablet with solid performance.  It has a nice feature where different users can be allocated, so you each have your own dedicated \"desktop\".  This allows each user to have their own wallpaper and apps, BUT some system settings carry through to each user; not a very big deal.  The only hindrance is that subsequent users cannot access external memory cards, and there is no way to give administrative rights to anyone else except the owner; that's pretty dumb.As a writer I will say that extended typing on the keyboard can be annoying, since the navigation bar runs along the bottom of the screen; your palm will rest along the bottom and activate the back, home, or menu buttons.  I've emailed Sony and made the suggestion to change the OS layout to correct the issue.  Like I said, it is only an annoyance, I rarely write extended pieces on the touch keyboard, BUT it is very fluid and I can type quite efficiently with it.  If it were not for the OS layout, then I may use it more frequently to write.The waterproof covers can be a pain in the ass to open every time you want to charge it or plug in headphones, so I would opt to purchase the charging cradle.  I don't have it yet, but am looking into it as a future buy.

Not fantastic build quality (as compared to the outstanding Asus tablets), but they had to cut corners to make it light (ie all plastic).  Similar to a Kindle or the Nexus with plastic rather than metal.Biggest advantage is it is light.  Biggest negative is the USB charging is S L O W and fighting the waterproof cover is a bit of a hassle (and gets in the way of some usb plugs).  I ended up buying the charging stand and that takes the hassle out of charging.Overall, a very good tablet (I've had 6 others, so have lots of comparisons with Apple/Samsung/Acer/Motorola and class leading Asus tablets).  I bought (and returned) the new Asus tablet as it seemed like a brick (all of ~3 oz heavier).  But the Asus was gorgeous build and stunning screen, with a much larger battery - and of course was designed to accept their optional keyboard - all of which made the tablet heavier (but much more useful for those who need it).  By contrast, the Xperia is stripped down - lacks the bells and whistles and class leading screen/design/battery life in exchange for being light.I'd place the Xperia a step below the Asus, but I found the power/beauty of the Asus simply lost out to the lightness of the Xperia (I am a power user of my tablets - probably in my hands 12 hours a day, so lightness becomes a top consideration).", "Title": "Biggest asset is it's lightness of being.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Cody", "ReviewID": "RH0VAN9WTRRY7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet trusting the Sony name as easy to use and reliable products.

It is the thinnest and lightest 10\" tablet that I have seen to date - iPads included.  It follows the design of most Android devices in having a matte plastic back and nice rounded corners.  Users will find the headphone, micro SD, and micro USB ports hard to open unless you look in good light for the slot for your fingernail to pry them open.  The fit is snug, but this is required for the dust and water resistant design to hold up.  Don't expect the water resistant claims to hold up if you have one of these compartments open!  The only things I don't like on the design are the power and volume buttons.  The power button is small and stiff, and it gives no haptic feedback that the device has turned on.  Wait for the blue light next to the power button to flash.  The volume rocker is harsh, hard plastic that just feels out of place on a high-end device.  It does have the tactile advantage of being easy to use without looking, but this is a small concession.Setup:  Getting up and running with the Sony Xperia Z is super easy - especially if you have used other Android devices.  The main thing you will want to do is look at the diagram to find where the various ports are located and how to open them.  Once you do that, plug it in for the stated minimum of 30 minutes or until the charging light turns from yellow to green.  I did the latter, and it took about 2 hours.  After you charge the device, fire it up and enter your wireless information and Google account.  There is a small update that I recommend you download and install before getting started.  Now you are ready to rock and roll.  I should also note that the Xperia Z boots faster (average of 25 seconds) than any other Android device I've had - phones and tablets included.Media Usage:  The display on the Xperia Z is a sight to behold - capable of true 1080p playback with rich, warm colors.  When you combine this with 9 hours of battery life, you have a device that begs to play your favorite video content.  If you plan to download content for use on an airplane, I recommend adding a micro SD card since the onboard storage is a bit puny at 16 GB.  I watched videos on Netflix, Crackle, Watch ESPN, and YouTube, and the playback is outstanding with one small gripe.  When starting up a streaming video, the picture is very pixelated much like the early days of digital cable.  This smooths out once it buffers enough data, and the picture stays crisp from that point on.  The throne room scene at the beginning of Thor is nothing short of stunning.  One other thing I noticed was that navigation of the Netflix UI when selecting a video to watch is very choppy.  I believe this may be an issue with the Netflix Android app because I have observed it on other Android tablets as well.  Be that as it may, it is still disappointing to experience it on a high-end device.  It makes it feel like a cheap knockoff tablet rather than a premium device.  Make no mistake about it.  This is priced as a high-end device.Music Playback:  Just as you would expect videos to pop, sound quality on the Xperia Z also excels.  Without headphones, the four speakers produce a nice overall sound; however, bass is lacking.  When I say that, it is lacking to the point of being unbalanced in its lacking.  K'Naan's \"ABCs\" had no detectable bass line at all.  This changes altogether when I plugged in my Monster Diesel Vektr headphones.  The sound quality is every bit as good (if not better) than what my HTC Rezound produces.  Sound on streaming music and local storage is both outstanding.Gaming:  I'm not the world's biggest gamer, but I found the experience to be better than any of the other tablets I've used.  Plasma Sky was smooth with good sound quality.  I don't own any of the higher end games that would stress the processor, and thus, I cannot speak to its performance there.Universal Remote:  This is a unique feature that I haven't seen on other Android tablets.  I was able to follow the setup steps and add my LG TV and Blu-Ray player, Cisco Cable Box, and Roku with no issues.  The interface also lets you create macros to setup different activities and transitions.  The one thing missing is the Logitech Harmony functionality of knowing how to automatically transition between activities and devices at the touch of a button.  However, as a free add-on, the functionality is more than adequate.  This feature is potentially good enough to justify some of the higher cost if you do not already have something like a Harmony remote.Connectivity:  I had no issues setting up or staying connected to my WPA-2 protected Wi-Fi with a hidden SSID.  My experience was similar at work with our 802.1x user authenticated Wi-Fi.  I was also able to connect my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and use it without any issues.  It performed as expected based on other tablets I've used.  I own Touchdown for Exchange, and I connected to my e-mail without issue.  This is somewhat of a tangent, but I highly recommend a third party e-mail app for connecting to Exchange if your company has the security PIN functionality turned on.  This limits the PIN scope and data wipe to the third party app rather than your entire device.  I don't want to have to enter a PIN every time I unlock my device even if I'm not accessing my corporate data.  Back to the Xperia - Gmail also works as expected.Complaints:  All is not positive with the Sony Xperia Z.  While battery life is good, charging time leaves something to be desired.  My rough benchmarks are about 20% battery charge per hour putting it at 5 full hours to charge after a full drain.  I work around this by dropping it on the charger anytime I put it down with 50% power or less remaining.  In addition, the browser experience on Chrome is on the lackluster side.  This is not unique to the Xperia Z as I find it underwhelming on every Android device - even the Silk accelerated browser on the Kindle Fire.  The response can also be a bit wonky as an attempted clicking on a link often results in zooming instead.  When you throw in the lack of Flash support, it makes me long for a \"real\" computer.  Then, Sony went over the top with bloatware.  They include a myriad of their music and video products along with a couple of alternate app/game stores.  The nice thing about Android 4.0 and above is that you can disable these apps so that they don't show up, but you need to root your device in order to remove them.  Finally, there are few choices in the way of cases.  The only one that looks worthwhile comes from Sony at a retail price of $79.  Amazon has a few, but my trusty standby brand Targus does not have one.  In the end, none of these is a showstopper, and they are on par with other Android tablets.  I guess I'm just holding out hope that someone will buck the trend of annoying users and taking up space with useless junk.Conclusion:  The Sony Xperia Z is an excellent media consumption tablet with a nice extra in its universal remote software.  It is a bit pricy and skimpy on storage, but the performance is better than average.

If you have had experience with an iPad or Samsung tablets, this tablet will only disappoint you. All of the \"connectors\" ie. charger, Sim card, SD card are all difficult to access and I suspect over time, they will break off.  Also, with only 30 minute use, there are fingerprints all over the screen, compared to others. And finally, Sony uses a front end that hides the Android OS standard functions and doesn't yet have the latest version, Kitkat.I would suggest an iPad Air for the same price or the new Samsung Galaxy Pro tablets.", "Title": "It aint no ipad nor Galaxy Tab!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "jello", "ReviewID": "R2NDC7GZAOH0MY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The tablet was excellent quality, very fast and slim. The layout was simple. However, it takes awhile to turn on and off. For me, after 2 weeks of having it, it began to randomly blink and the text would become condensed and elongated while spazzing out during web browsing. The bluetooth tends to disconnect with the keyboard.  All of this would be fixed after rebooting it but it would occur again after a few hours. I had a replacement for it and it still had the same issues. Also,  the replacement tend to lag slightly. In the end, I had to return it and got a refund. I would have given this a 5 star if it hadn't been for the defects. I really do prefer this tablet over my new one but I probably won't by this until the glitch is fixed.", "Title": "defective", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00CE590Z0", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
