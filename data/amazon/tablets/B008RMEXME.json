If I would have known this ahead of time, I probably wouldn't have ordered it, but I'm so glad I did.)First of all, the shipping was lightening fast. It was delivered to me in 3 days from China. Are you kidding me? I couldn't believe it. When I placed the order, the very next day I tracked my package online and the starting point was China. I was like WTH? Now I have to wait 20 days for my package to arrive, but to my surprise the process only took 3 days. AWESOME! It was cushioned very well to protect the unit from accidents.I love this Android tablet. I took a chance on this because I never heard of this brand before. It just lets me know that you can't always judge a book by its cover and just because something isn't a well known name brand that it isn't any good as the name brands out there. I've been using the ZTO tablet for several days now and I'm very pleased. I love the Android system.  It comes preloaded with Ice cream Sandwich OS and a few apps to get you started.  The 9\" is not too big or too small. My only pet peeve is that the \"one\" speaker is located in the back of the unit - BOMBER! I wish there was 2 speakers located on the front of each side of the unit. Oh well! To me the speaker isn't that loud but this unit rocks with a pair of headphones. It sounds better than the Itouch.I was considering getting an Ipad but I changed my mind. Although I don't have a problem with Apple products, I can't stand electronics that I can't add an SD Card to. Apple is a freakin' ripoff for this. They make sure to design their devices where you can't add extra storage.I purchased a 32 gig card and inserted it in the tablet. It was recognized immediately. Connection to my wireless network was flawless. I was connected in 15 seconds and began downloading apps to my SD card. What I also love about this tablet is that while it's downloading and installing the app to your device, it immediately gives you an option to move most apps to your SD card. The screen is a bit sensitive, which is a good thing. I've experienced some lagging issues, but nothing major to make me dislike it.I have been playing games, downloading videos and doing some of everything else on this tablet. For now, I love it. For what I need this to do, I'm glad I didn't spend the outrageous money on an Ipad.It's quite difficult to find cases for this tablet that may fit properly. I ordered one off Ebay and I'm hoping it will fit.(I will update this review if I discover major issues with this tablet).UPDATE: NOV. 16th 2012This tablet is still going strong. I love it. I can't believe how clear this screen is. I love the colors. The Youtube videos play flawlessly as well as many of the other videos I play on this.I purchased a mini keyboard case for this and it works well with it. No problems. I'm able to use it to update my status on Facebook and perform other light typing function. I'm still loving it.  I will update if I run into any problems, but so far no major issues at all.", "Title": "A Very Pleased ZTO Customer", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "J.R.", "ReviewID": "R1C1044JYRGUVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a collection of netbooks and tablets but this one caught my eye as worth getting. I planned to purchase the $139.00 unit but at the last minute I switched to the $159.00 offer that included the case/stand and a keyboard.Everything works as expected including Google Play,You Tube, Amazon Store, and a solid wifi with excellent reception.  The only weakness was with downloaded MP4 You Tube videos which tended to pixelate and break up. The newer webm format videos were much better. I'm sure the MP4's would run better if I took the time to download a dedicated mp4 player from Google Play.Also, the Google Voice Search on the browser wasn't very accurate but might improve over time.

The screen size is great and it's been very easy to use. the android system makes it easy to use. It's very similar to using a smartphone. The item came with a slipcase, earphones,AC charger, usb cords and a free screen protector. It came fully charged and I turned it on and it was ready to go. The system makes it easy to sync your Gmail and google apps. I love that it came pre-loaded with the GooglePlay market and the Amazon app. The only drawback is the location of the memory card slot. You have to practically use something like a pen or a fingernail file to get the card in to the slot. It ejects fine but getting the card in can be a problem. So far so good though. This is a great product especially for the price. I played around with the tablet the first day for about 5 or 6 hours before the battery started to show that it was low.

I purchased this due to the great reviews.  In reality what I found was...1) Poor quality display - Horrible viewing angles, you have to hold it straight in one position for good viewing.  The color saturation (which is what make colors pop) is just terrible.  My nephew thought I was playing a \"knock off\" Angry Birds game since it looked so low quality and different.2) Extremely slow - When you click a program it takes forever to load.  Seriously, it's like stepping back to the year 2000 when you were used to waiting for everything to load.  Not acceptable these days.  Plus it kept crashing due to the horrible speed of the tablet.With all that said, I would recommend this tablet as a toy for a child IF it falls under the $100 price.  However by then I'm sure there will be much better $100 tablets.With the current $170 price it is a waste.  You are better off buying a 7\" Google Nexus which is what I'm buying now!  I reached the conclusion that its better to have 7\" of a fast tablet with a great display than 9\" of a piece of junk.I hope this review helps save you from a waste of time buying, hating and returning this thing.", "Title": "Reviews may be falsified!", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Author": "Nnamdi", "ReviewID": "R15HAJXYO318GS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best tablet you can get in this price range...delivering more bang for your money. The privilege of working in an IT/Computer environment as a technician has exposed me to various types and makes of Tablets giving me the opportunity to also compare them.First of all it came rooted meaning you have administrative rights and control of this little gem so you can remove any of the program/app that you don't really need unlike the popular brands that comes preloaded with lots of bloat-ware that takes up a lot of memory space and leaving you with no choice/option to delete them.It is fast and the size at 9\" is just perfect because it's in-between the popular sizes of 10\" and 7\"...making it not too big nor too small. Included in the package is an external USB Port so you can plug things like flash drive/stick, Keyboard etc and it will read or recognize it just like a regular Computer does. Most of the Apps I tested installed very fine with no issues of compatibility.The resolution of the screen display is not that great but not a deal breaker, you only notice it when you're doing something with very detailed/minute graphics but still all the Movies I watched plus the HD ones came out all great.The sound is not loud enough and having the mono-speaker on the back made it worse but when you plug in some headphones, it works flawlessly and you'll be transported into an entirely new stereo world. The battery is great but don't expect it to last 10 hours.It also doesn't have the following:Bluetooth - which I don't really use on any tablet I own.GPS -  Impractical for me to use a tablet this big that also relies on wifi for data to sit on my dashboard as my GPS.Camera quality is good enough for applications like Skype since its only 1.3mp so if that's what you're looking for then you will be disappointed. I use my phone as my primary camera because of it's better resolution, portability, practicality and ease of useSo with all said and done I'm happy with my purchase. Omar is very great to deal with and he is always very ready to help, prompt to answer your questions or resolve any issue. I gave it 5 stars because it works perfect for my needs.

At first I was very excited to get this tablet for only $149. I thought not bad. I have never owned a tablet before nor am I a gadget person. I have to say I am very disappointed. For it being an off brand tablet that was not the biggy for me. It ran good. It has a ton of space on it and I used it rather than my phone and had a ton of apps on their with still room to spare. That I will give it a plus on. It ran fast and smooth.  But however just past my 30 days and i mean like day 34, however the wall charger for the unit stopped working. When I contacted them saying ugh whats up they said use the USB charger that was provided. Well duh, so I did. Figured no big deal. Now its just past 3 months and what happens? The usb charger stopped working as well. The power button lost its spring as well as the volume button. I asked what could be done since its past the 30 day refund or return policy they told me to pay a $20 fee to paypal for return service and to have it mailed back priority only through USPS. Couldn't use any other carrier or any other way of shipping back. Yeah well to ship to China was almost $70. So I would be spending about $90 bucks to ship this back for them to repair or replace. And no telling when I would receive it back. I told them thanks but no thanks, I will count my loss. So be prepared if intending to buy this. I never took this tablet out of the house. Never dropped this tablet or anything. WiFI was home so that is where it stayed. Never spilled on it. Always took really good care of it. Hello was first time for me having something like this before. But for it to only last 3 months. That is what I wasn't happy about. Yes I could spend $90 bucks to have repaired or replaced but then what? Will it go out on me again in 3 months?

The battery lasts a long time.  yes it depends on what you use it for but so far it lasted about 6 hours with heavy internet surfing.  I haven't found anything that wouldn't download from play store.  the screen functions fine.  it's a little slow when surfing the web but nothing too bad.  I added a 16g sd card.  it has a strong wifi signal.  only negative I have found is it will not work with Verizon fios apps to view movies and control DVR.  Not sure why unless it's because it's an unlocked device.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a decent tablet.review update 7/17/2013I'm sorry but customer service sucks.  anytime you want this repaired it has to go to China for warranty work  cost for parts and shipping (USPS only) to and from.  Funny thing is international shipping regulations restrict shipping lithium batteries via USPS...hmmmm, wonder if they know.  about $75.00 to repair a defective micro usb port for a product that cost 139.00, for the extra 75.00 you can get a \"good\" tablet?  this item slowed down horribly after just a few app installs.  had to do a factory reset and it is still slow now.  Takes about 5 minutes when you first wake it up to check for gmails and do a scan for any upgrades it thinks it might need, so go do something else for 5 or 10 minutes and don't try to use it at all or else you will slow it down even more.
