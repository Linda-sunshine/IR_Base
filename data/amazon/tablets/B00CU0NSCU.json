I loved my First Gen Kindle Fire! Here are my problems with the new version:1. The web browser silk is worse than the original.  Selecting book marks is awkwardly different and cumbersome.  Webpages just don't always load.  Google news webpage jitters when scrolling.  Sometimes it will not select a link when you touch the link.  The browser just locks up.2.  The email app is worse.  It no longer has a SPAM button when reading email.  It does not allow you to open an email that is a multi-thread email.  I have to select another email and then go back to the one that I wanted to open.3.  Settings is no longer available from the main screen.  I have to back up to Home, select Apps and then select Settings?  Why did they make it more difficult to do something?  I change my display settings often and find the new version frustrating.4.  Less apps.  Apps that I used for years such as the Directv app or Radio.com app are not available for my new Kindle even though I used them for years on my first gen Kindle Fire.5.  Many functional aspects of th operating system changed and I basically had to relearn how to use the Kindle Fire.

We are so incredibly disappointed in this offering from Amazon, if I could give this product zero stars I would.- Freetime is a HUGE pain in the butt to use with different ways to access different types of access restrictions, you can never remember where or how to turn on/off certain features, and figure out which child has access to which items.- If you want kids to have access to the free Amazon Prime videos that you are already watching on TV and other devices, you will NOT be able to access these while in kids mode (FreeTime). You have to pay additional monthly fee either for one child or the family rate, to access those same videos you already get for free on other devices, while in Freetime mode in the kindle HD. Confusing (and greedy)? Yup. I think it's called FreeTime unlimited, and we have not tried it, since we are ready for other reasons to write these devices off as the biggest Christmas gift goof ever. I don't think we saw that anywhere in the descriptions of the device, although we saw references to being able to buy unlimited kid video access for a fee per month, we thought that was optional not required. Only on the kindle itself under the help section did we find that (after purchase). Editing to add: you also can't access kids' kindle library books in FreeTime - which was one of the main things I want them to be able to do! I'm happy to buy some kindle books from Amazon for the kids (and did buy several and loaded those before giving to the kids, but they STILL had problems accessing in wireless mode).- Things just disappear off of the device back into the cloud and suddenly become inaccessible with no wireless access. I bought two digital movies and a bunch of apps, downloaded them to the devices (this took about 15 hours of work for me to get two movies and apps onto three devices), then checked to make sure they were all downloaded by opening them with wireless turned off at home, added them to the three kids' FreeTime profiles (another few hours since there are three kids), got on an airplane with three cranky preschoolers, and... half of the stuff wouldn't open without wireless. I don't know if it starts to get bumped off of the device as you run out of storage or what, but we got various messages saying library can't be opened, or just a \"!\" with no explanation. After a month we have had to do two things to be able to use these devices in any meaningful way: 1. turn OFF FreeTime (which controls what kids see) and 2. kept the wireless on, which we really hadn't wanted to do. This is a problem since we have these linked our family account which also has adult content (do not meanporn! but the occasional R-rated action/adventure movie, a romance novel, whatever - not appropriate for the kids to be browsing). So if you mean to use these for kids I'd strongly suggest starting a new account for the kids and getting them their own Prime or FreeTime paid access, depending on age and how much you trust them/ will be nearby while they are using the devices.- Most of the free apps for android, just to warn you, also have advertising and/or require in-app purchases to be turned on for them to work (or even to open). Some of them state this in fine print, many others do not. Many of the apps we've gotten for free or paid for (or tried both version), will not open when in wireless mode. So this device is extremely frustrating during travel.- These are very cheaply made. The power cord attachments are already loose after a month of sporadic use, and only my husband and I handle them (carefully) to plug them in or while charging, so it's not kid abuse.This device does NOT WORK for the intended purpose. I wish we had just bought another iPad (we have had three, one of which is still in use in our home) and let the kids duke it out over the one, versus try to give the kids each their own (ridiculously inferior) device. I know you get what you pay for, but was really expecting more from Amazon. We continue to love our other kindles (we have a first generation and husband and I each have a newer paperwhite which we love), but will NOT try another of their android devices.", "Title": "Don't bother buying for a child, or if you want to use wirelessly", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "A.

First of all, the Kindle Fire HD Device itself is a good tablet.  It's not great.  It's definitely not buttery smooth like and iPad.  I'm disappointed to say this but the Kindle and Amazon's flavor of Android just still seems to be a little unpolished and quirky.  You do need to take into account the phenomenal price point of this tablet though.  With that in mind, it is definitely a decent tablet.  Build quality seems good for the hardware.  The operating system is just okay (sorry Amazon).  The device will serve it's purpose fine for a child's first tablet as long as you have a good case.Now on to the real purpose of this review.  If you are thinking about getting a Kindle for your child for Christmas (or any time) and taking advantage of the FreeTime Unlimited subscription model - DON'T DO IT!!!  I honestly don't know what the people at Amazon were thinking in the way they built the functionality FreeTime Unlimited subscription.  In theory it is brilliant.  You pay a nominal monthly fee to get access to hundreds if not thousands of pre-screened, age appropriate apps, books and videos.  Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, Amazon's implementation of this subscription feature is a complete and utter wreck in my personal opinion.  When you sign up for FreeTime Unlimited you are literally presented with EVERY SINGLE APP, BOOK AND VIDEO within your child's age range.  So if you go to the Apps page within FreeTime, your child will have to scroll through approximately 500 apps.  None of the apps are downloaded to your device at first - they just present the link / icon that you can click on to download the app to your device.  And once you've downloaded the app the only way to really tell if it is on your device is a little black check mark in the lower left hand corner of the icon.  If you're not connected to Wifi and the app isn't already on your Kindle - too bad.This might not seem like a big deal as you read this, but let me tell you it is a horrible implementation of a great idea.  If your child's favorite app happens to be one of the last on the list... they will have to scroll through all 500 of those icons before they can get to it on the Apps screen.  What if their favorite app is in the middle of the list?  Or is it 28% of the way down the list?  Or 73.6% of the way down the list?  Seriously, horrible implementation here.  Yes, you can \"pin\" your favorite apps to the Home screen within FreeTime, but forget about removing it from the Home screen.  To do that you have to switch back to the apps, videos or books screen and find it in the list of 100's and \"unpin\" it from there.Yes it is true that the nifty little carousel feature still displays your most recently used applications, books and videos within the FreeTime area, but that is really not that useful either in my opinion.What I really thought FreeTime Unlimited was going to be was a presentation of 100's or 1,000's of apps, books and videos for my child that I could then selectively choose what they could access and what would be presented in their FreeTime profile.  That is simply not the case.  There are books about monsters that I definitely wouldn't want my child to access.  If the Kindle is connected to Wifi and she clicks on the icon - it will download it to her profile.  To me though, it is ultimately the unorganized approach of just presenting every single item available and taking any form of control of what is displayed out of the hands of the parents that makes this so bad.  I can't imagine this is how any parent would want a subscription like this to work, especially for younger children.  Maybe I'm wrong, but for me FreeTime Unlimited is a great idea gone horribly wrong the way it is currently implemented.And just to be clear, I am not the type of parent that intends to just hand the Kindle to my toddler and let her use it completely unsupervised.  I definitely want the experience to be interactive with mom and dad at all times.  I just want her to have an experience with technology that is not cluttered and overwhelming.  And I also want the control to determine the apps, books and videos that she has access to.  Perhaps I'm asking for too much, but I don't think that's really the case here.  I think it's a sloppy implementation of the FreeTime Unlimited subscription model on Amazon's part.  The FreeTime app on it's own allows you to do exactly that - you can pick and choose which apps, books and videos you have downloaded to your Kindle to present to them within FreeTime.  But once you sign up for FreeTime Unlimited, be prepared to have a cluttered, overwhelming, sloppy mess of 100's - 1000's of apps that you have no control over in the FreeTime app.Kudos to Amazon for being a smart and innovative company.  Shame on you for having such a great idea with FreeTime Unlimited and implementing it so poorly.  Seriously, how hard would it be to figure out a way to allow parents to selectively add only the apps, books and videos they want from the FreeTime Unlimited library?", "Title": "MUST READ for those interested in Kindle FreeTime Unlimited", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "DLimp", "ReviewID": "R3J0JA0YWPR8UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have two of the original Fire's and this is a great replacement for our kids.

My father(who had purchased it) had explained that Amazon had great customer service and to call. Upon calling I was pleased to find out that they were willing to offer me an out of warranty credit towards any new Kindle fire. I explained it wasn't good timing for me to do it but after the holidays were over I would. With the holidays ending I called Amazon today to do just that. After being transferred and on the phone for over 15 minutes just to talk to someone about why I called, the customer service rep I did encounter was extremely rude to me after I expressed that I was frustrated and was tempted just to buy something else. Her response was, \"that's your choice\" and hung up the phone on me. I was nothing but respectful towards her and was appalled at being treated that way. Upset, I called back and spoke with a supervisor who seemed like he could have cared less and just wanted to get me off the phone. He just kept saying I don't want to take up your time so I'll just let you go. After I expressed to him that he didn't really seem to care, there were minutes of silence. He finally responded with I'll give you a credit towards ebooks and such then. I responded with okay. He transferred me back to the kindle department without ever giving me the promised credit(not surprised after the customer service I had received earlier that day). I finally talk to another supervisor in the kindle department named Matt I believe and he was one of the better customer service people I spoke with. After explaining everything for the 6th time(and being over the phone over an hour at this point) he transferred me to another department that deals with out of warranty deals. After speaking with the rep there, he explained the only thing he could offer me with the 7 inch was a 32 gb. I explained that I didn't want 32gb, and I asked to speak to a supervisor yet again. I was placed on hold for about 5 minutes and then hung up on for a second time. I never once was rude, raised my voice or was disrespectful but for some reason was hung up on twice. I'm irate that this is how such a large company handles themselves. I then called back for the 3rd and final time. Again after asking for a manager I was put on hold and then ultimately just disconnected. I will forever bid goodbye to Amazon.

I bought 3 - one for each child.  However, if you're interested in FreeTime, know that it is oriented towards really young kids.  And your entire Amazon Cloud is available on EACH Kindle without FreeTime.  So, parents, if you have books and magazines  on YOUR kindle that aren't child appropriate (and I'm sure you do) your child will have access to them without FreeTime.Issue #1:  My 9 year old and 7 year old want access to certain websites that are totally fine - sumdog (math games), pottermore (a harry potter fan site), americangirl.com and the like.  With FreeTime, there is NO WAY to give your child access to those sites. Internet browsing is completely restricted and as the parent you can't enable internet browsing or choose specific sites to grant access.  So, disappointingly, my kids can't use great sites on their Kindle Fires.  I don't want to disable FreeTime because I'd rather err on the side of control, but it should take into account the fact that parents of older children and tweens may want to pick and choose websites to give their child access too without giving access to everything.Issue #2:  Why on earth is the entire Amazon Cloud content available on every Kindle?  My children - even if they were teens - do not need access to every book that has been downloaded to our shared cloud!  I shouldn't have to go back and delete things to avoid giving them access. And what if I want to read a Harlequin romance or the like or some trashy magazine?  Why should my child automatically have access to it if I want to read it?Issue #3:  I can't get the Amazon Cloud Player with free time.  I have CDs in my cloud player.  Can't give access to the kids due to the insane FreeTime restrictions.  So, if I want to give my kids access to music from Frozen, Disney Princess, Taylor Swift etc., I can't.I called up to see if this can be fixed and after being bounced around on the phone tree, the Amazon rep \"took my suggestions\" about improving FreeTime.  Hope they do!  Amazon listen up: Don't force us to choose between overly restrictive Kindle FreeTime and a free for all of shared content.

If you're an average/occasional reader and are looking for a devise to browse the web, read books and play games, I'd say your money is better used for an iPad. If this is a purchase solely as an ereader and in addition to your usual tablet, then it is a great product and worth the money.Pros-Great portable size that can easily be placed in a purse or travel bag-Vibrant colors and fast graphics-Very easy to read in all light setting (artificial, daylight by the pool, reading in bed at night)-Amazon Prime enables downloading of one book at a time, for as long as you need to borrow it-Good battery life which allows you a lot of usage without frequent breaks to charge-Easy grip style allows you hold in one hand with a no-slip functionEbook Pros-Hold and define words function. Super user intuitive and great, especially for young readers who don't want to get out a dictionary and may just skip over a word they may not know-Great to read in all light settings: dark, light, natural light. Unlike other tablets, can adjust the backlighting to compensate for where you are and your viewing preference-Numerous ebooks available to borrow for free through Amazon Prime programCons-Hard to type for a period of time, especially if you have larger hands. My hands are tiny, I wear a size 4 ring, but I noticed browsing the web is almost a tedious task. Forget paragraph emails; I'd rather use something else than this. Yes, it is bigger than an iPhone, but the in between size of not big-not-small product makes for awkward keyboard usage-Not user intuitive. This may be because I'm used to using an iPad, however when I got it out of the box, I expected to be able to figure this thing out in minutes. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. It took me quite some time to figure out how to use the borrow function of books on Amazon Prime. I would've like to have seen a home screen button which would take me straight to it as soon as I opened it up. I also think it would give Amazon another place to capture an audience for the Prime subscription-As a tablet, it just doesn't cut it. I bought this as a supplement to a tablet for reading so I could just throw it in my purse while on the go, but I hoped buying the Kindle Fire HD would provide a bit of extra umph so I could phase out my tablet and just use this portable device. The apps aren't as great nor nearly as many, however maybe it's just timing and once developers realize they need to expand their platforms, better games and apps will be available.Overall, if you have the extra money and are looking for a strictly reading device, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Kindle HD.

The only thing wrong with it was when I started running out of storage space for apps. I kept deleting and deleting and finally faced up to the fact that I needed a new device with more storage. When the new Kindle Fire HD came I was so excited. until I got it out of the box and began to us it. The factory settings were terrible. I had to call tech support to fix the settings so I could single tap and not have to use 2 fingers to swipe the unlock bar on the screen to work like the old one did. A very reliable app I have used since the days o my old Palm ViiX, that ran just fine on my original fire, proved to be another headache. No longer can I just plug the device into the computer and easily transfer files via the cable I have to use box sync now. So when I sent my word files to the device via box sync the device kept demanding I buy a new office app for the device. So here came 3 days of fussing and calls. The factory setting on the device caused another issue.Stranded indoors because of the weather I needed an escape and began watching videos. This device runs Netflix but has to frequently have the cache dumped and the device itself reset while watching. The great frequency the device has to be reset is really very annoying. I have had to reset the device more in the short time I have owned it than my original Fire was reset the entire time I have owned it. In fact depending on what I am doing I have to reset the device 4 to 6 times a day on the worst of the days.Being able to get a case with a closure that turns the device on and off when the cover is opened sounded really great. Unfortunately I am experiencing a problem with setting the device down at night, fully charged, and picking it up the next morning to find it badly needs to be charged. The day I am writing this it had a 9% charge when I picked it up - down from the 100% charge it had when I sat it on the table the night before. Now it had not been touched overnight. This was not the first time.I so wanted to love this device as much as the old one but I just can't. The buttons are located on an angled surface on the case of the device and are very fussy to operate at times. The little light that went on on the old device to indicate red while charging, green when fully charged is missing on this one. The battery life is great when it doesn't discharge overnight while not being used.The pro to this device - the sound is greatly improved.

The options for apps were better than my Nook.  I loved the fact that I could check out an electronic library book. I loved Kindle Free Time for my 3 year old.  HOWEVER, my Kindle randomly got stuck in the \"restart loop\" and after trying all the online fixes, I called customer support.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they would send me a replacement.  What they neglected to tell me was that the replacement was a refurbished Kindle.  I received my first replacement on November 16th, 2013.  After spending the time to register it and download all of the apps that I previously had, the \"new\" Kindle started to act up. I called customer support once again and at this time offered to PAY EXTRA for a new Kindle Fire HD (instead of a refurbished one); however, was told that wasn't an option.  When I offered to PAY EXTRA to be able to upgrade to an HDX, was told that was not an option either.  (Apparently, if I had an older model, paying to upgrade to the HDX would have been an option, but not since I had the HD.)  When I received the second replacement on December 2nd, 2013, it was acting up straight out of the box, but I was determined to give it a shot.  (By \"acting up\", I mean the volume would randomly increase to the highest level and make the \"binging\" noise.  It also would randomly just pop up the \"shut down\" box and I would have to hit cancel repeatedly and hope that it didn't shut down.)  However, I was going to give this one a fair shake since it was my second refurbished replacement and I REALLY didn't want to go through the registration process, download all of my apps AGAIN if it wasn't going to work.  Long story short (although that ship has sailed), I should have immediately called and returned the second replacement.  It worked for a while and here I am in the same place I was in November on January 12, waiting for my third replacement Kindle to arrive.  Again, I offered to pay extra to either get a New Kindle HD or HDX instead of a refurbished one. (I was told that I could not pay extra to get a new HD as there were none available; however, when I look on the website it appears that there are New HD's available...not sure what that is about.)  I spoke to THREE customer support staff who were very apologetic but could not really fix my problem. (Don't get me wrong, I know that it isn't their fault that their hands are tied, but the situation is getting ridiculous at this point.)  I was again told that it was not an option for me to pay extra for a new device at this time and that my comments would be passed along to leadership and that the best way for me to share my thoughts was to review my purchase, so here it is.  If my 3rd replacement works for longer than a month, I MIGHT increase my star rating to three.  If my 3rd replacement doesn't work, I only have one request... that SOMEONE/OTHER COMPANY has developed a Kindle Free Time equivalent so that I can trade my Kindle in for a reliable tablet that will work consistently.

It did not have the build quality issue as the original.Booting it up I noticed that the brightness on the new one was better, since I compared it side by side with the first one at the same display settings. But once the firmware update got done on the replacement, the screen brightness went lower. Maybe its something to do with extending battery life via the firmware update.Apparently Amazon took a serious note of my concerns and they sent me a custom shipping label which would get the defective kindle back to their engineering section rather than the returns center. Good work Amazon! Hopefully you will be able to do something to improve the display quality on this. I mean the resolution is great and there are a lot of details in the display, but the it looks like it it about to grey out and die- especially compared to the first gen Kindle Fire I have been using for more than 2 years.So based on all this, I will update my review to 3 stars. I see a lot of reviewers talking about how great this is for the price. But the fact is that there are a decent number of tablets out there for $100+.

The back panel was actually loose and was flexing when I touched it. I am shocked as I never expected Amazon to cut costs when it came to quality.Powering it on was an even bigger disappointment - the white is more like a yellow and when I cranked up the brightness the backlight started flickering! Very bad Amazon.The Amazon skin over android is as usual very heavy and the tablet remains sluggish in performance. But that was the case for he first generation as well and didnt bother me as much since the hardware was so well built.Amazon customer care is awesome as usual, and when I contacted them, they sent me a replacement which is on the way.

The problem is that it won't stay charged for more than 2 or 3 hours.  I called Amazon customer service and was told to perform a hard reset, turn down the brightness, and to turn off wi-fi.

All of this is happening after spending an entire day online and in stores searching for a kid proof case for this Kindle because the old ones don't work for it!  So, I guess I won't be receiving any real assistance or a replacement for my Kindle and I'll just have to live with a Kindle that won't work for more than 2 hours.  And, even if they did decide to do something about it we have been discussing this problem for so long that my date to return the Kindle has almost passed.I have NEVER had any problem with Amazon or their customer service prior to this and I am truly disappointed in how this has been handled.  So, I suggest ordering the older Kindle Fire model or a different tablet all together because if you happen to get a faulty one that's just to bad.

Reading time is not limited. She has had it for 2-weeks now, so this is an \"early\" review.  I'll update this review at a later date if things go wrong with the device. We are having problems getting the 'sylus pen' application to work, so my daughter can keep a journal - but I honestly think it is having 2 parents that lack electronic device knowledge, having never downloaded an App before. So since I have nothing else to really compare it to, I have to just say we are overall very happy with it and our 8-year old thinks it is a godsend - she loves books and is excited to grow her electronic library.

My mother has the original Kindle Fire, I have the 2nd generation HD and I wanted to buy one for my father for his birthday who was the odd man out without one.As a student, I have Amazon Prime and I manage to get it THE NEXT DAY after ordering it which was amazing and completely surprised me. Also when I first opened the tablet I thought I got the wrong tablet as I didn't know the HD was redesigned and looks now like the HDX (The pictures of the back needs to be updated on the website).The back design are more arched so it does fit in the hands better. It is also smaller and lighter than the 2nd Gen HD. The slightly annoying flush buttons of the 2nd generation HD is now split to two sides of the Kindle which is better but i personally wish the buttons were raised because I still have the issue where i'm searching for the correct orientation. Also its worth noting that it does NOT have a front camera or have the micro HDMI port of the Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation. This isn't much of a deal breaker considering that all cheaper priced kindles were camera-less.The improvements of the OS makes use simpler. One of my favorite improvements is the lock screen. While it still has the advertisements, It now shows the time so you don't have to unlock the screen to see the time. Also the Silk browser is miles better on the first incarnation which we all can we was painful compared to Safari/Chrome/Dolphin.All in All, this Kindle Fire is a great entry tablet. If you just want a tablet to read, go on a few websites, then go play Candy Crush, This is a no brainer for the price. If you're more about productivity and apps, you look at your Nexus 7's and iPad Mini's", "Title": "Great Little tablet", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "theLorax", "ReviewID": "R2X6NNLLBQXMEL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent tablet for the money. Good bang for your buck. It's easy to recommend it for people who are on a very tight budget, or for casual users who subscribe to Amazon prime. This is not a tablet I would recommend to people who want the best tablet on the market.The Kindle Fire HD is a combination of good qualities, and limitations. I'll briefly go over the main ones.As I mentioned, the main selling point is the price. I got mine on black friday for $100, and that's quite a bit cheaper than a 16GB iPad Mini, or Microsoft Surface RT. The tablet has some good hardware that exceeds what other $100 tablets have. You get a dual core processor, and 1GB of RAM. Speed wise, it's pretty decent. App loading, and web browsing is pretty good. It's not blazing fast, but it's definitely not sluggish either. The screen is also very good considering this is an entry level tablet. The PPI/Resolution is quite high, giving photos, videos, and text a crisp, detailed look. Colors are vivid, and the brightness is adequate.One of the best things about this tablet is actually the speakers. It's stereo, and the two speakers are wide apart, combined with Dolby 5.1, it can have almost a surround sound. The volume also tops out at a surprising level. Of course you won't get a lot of bass. But the quality and volume level is quite good. Better than all the popular tablets I have owned or tried. Wifi performance is also great thanks to its dual antennas. Having an Amazon Prime membership will definitely elevate the experience with this device. Prime movies, TV shows, and rented books are integrated into the menus.Now for it's limitations. There is no camera. That means video conferencing with Skype is not possible, as well as snapping photos. This may not be a dealbreaker for most, since most people will have their cell phone cameras, and standalone cameras to use. But the previous Fire HD had a front facing camera. I don't see why they had to remove it.There is no voice dictation, and that's something I used quite a bit when composing emails. Anytime I needed to type in more than one sentence, I would use it. The device also does not have LTE. Again, this is something that only a small percentage of users would be taking advantage of anyways.It is also somewhat heavy considering it's size. But still not too heavy that you cant operate it comfortably with one hand. I also would have preferred if the bezels were thinner. This is mostly a personal preference. Some people say that the thick bezels prevent typos and accidentally touching things on the screen, but I haven't had a problem with thinner bezels when I used the iPad mini. The smaller dimensions would have been nice as I could have fit it in a coat pocket, and even jeans pockets probably.While many Android tablets have SD card slots, this one does not. It would have been good to have for putting on my own movies and music. But it's not a deal breaker.The Kindle Fire HD's OS \"Mojito\" is also very limited. On the bright side, it's very simple, easy to use, and reliable. I've rarely had apps crash, or things act buggy, or experience any persistent technical issues. Casual users, and people who are not technically inclined will appreciate the OS. However, this comes at a cost.The app selection is severely limited. There is nowhere near the amount of apps and content for Fire OS as there is on Google Play for standard Android devices. I have no idea why so many great games on Google Play are not available for this device, despite the fact that it has hardware that is more than good enough to run it. Not only games, but apps in all categories.One of the dealbreakers is that there are no other web browsers you can download and use on the device. I would have liked to use Chrome so I can sync bookmarks with my desktop, and I would have liked to use a special 3rd party browser that supports Flash like Photon for the iPad. A few of my most visited sites use Flash, and I cannot go to them on the Kindle. Also with Fire OS, you don't have the customization as regular android. You don't have Widgets either.Also the side buttons are quite small, and they are so flush with the edge of the device that they are difficult to find. It took me a while using the device before I could get accustomed to this. They also removed the HDMI output which was on the previous gen model. It would have definitely been nice to have. I often travel, and it would have been great to be able to bring my own HDMI cable and play my videos and games on the hotels TV's.I understand it is possible to root this device and install Android Jellybean on here, making the device more capable. But i've heard you lose the ability to use Amazon Prime, and that's something I can't lose since that's a big part of what I use the device for.Overall, I think this device is definitely worth the price it can be had for now, and it's definitely an okay choice among entry level tablets, but it definitely cannot compete against higher end tablets. For casual users who have amazon prime, this is an okay choice. If this came with standard Android, and it retained a front facing camera, hdmi output, and had an SD card slot, this would be much easier to recommend.", "Title": "Good for the price, but ultimately it's flawed.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "W. Watson", "ReviewID": "R10KNTGOW4CDWF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The device functions well. I don't have any complaints about that --reading books is easy enough, exept when you want to leave the book. Getting it to show you the exit from a book requires a lot of repeated tapping at the bottom of the screen because the little tab for bringing up the navigation menu disappears, and it's not always easy to get it to come back so you can exit the book. That part I consider a minor annoyance.What does bother me is that they make managing applications to be ridiculously complex. If I want to force an application to stop, I can't do it from the application. Instead, If it's a game, You have to exit the game and get back to the home screen, then flick the top down to select settings then go to applications, then to manage applications, then you have to scroll through every application to find it, or select the dropdown to view running applications, then click on it, and then hit the force stop, to shut off the applications. You can have apps running for days after you think you've closed it --just sucking system resources.The thing that really turned my smiley face upside down is accessing files you have on your kindle. Finding what you've put on is the most abysmal experience I've had in computing. The lack of any sort of explorer-like interface makes me think the designers were just high on crack when they were working on this. Even on my three year old smartphone, I can click on the file explorer and see where everything is. I'm not using it for much, but when I'm trying to find a picture that I've stored on it and you have more than a hundred, it's just out and out aggravating. Folder navigation is the cornerstone of just about every operating system, but it's conspicuously absent.The photo/video section deserves its own roasting. What sort of idiot thinks that people wouldn't want to sort their photos or reorder them by date, file name or size, etc? I uploaded some of the images from a comic I'm working on onto my kindle, and when I go to view them in order, the kindle decides on some sort of random algorithm that makes absolutely no sense --in what order it's going to show them to you. Even though my pictures were in named numerically so they could be viewed/sorted in the proper order, they do not show that way in the built in photo app. And they're grouped together with every other photo that I have.  There is no way to navigate to the separate folder in which I placed them, and there's no way to view only the contents of that folder. That is the stupidest setup I have ever encountered. You have no option anywhere to change how it displays them, or to tell it to sort by name or by folder or anything we take for granted on 99% of the other android devices out there.

Progressivly it got worse where it would shut down and the only way to get it to start back up would be to plug it in to turn it back on (and the battery was not low).

I have to say I was hesitant about buying it. I'm an Apple person. My house is full of apple devices. I have an iPhone, MacBook Air and there are multiple iPads in my home including the iPad 2, iPad 4 and the iPad air. The only reason I really wanted a Kindle was to have easy access to the Amazon kindle store since apple has denied access to buy Kindle ebooks directly from an Apple app. I know. It's crap, but what are we going to do about it. I should also mention I also own a Nook and while I have ebooks on it I prefer the Kindle store to the Nook store. It's much more organized and has a much wider selection.Okay, now on to the Kindle review. I ordered it not expecting to use it for much more than reading books and the occasional app to pass the time on but when I turned it on I was very surprised. The screen is amazing. The set up was super easy and I immediately downloaded a few apps to test the screen resolution. I did a side by side screen resolution comparison with iPad 4 and we (my family and I) agreed the Kindle was marginally better. We even zoomed in on a web page and yes, the iPad 4 was faster to load and smooth the small text we zommed to but the Kindle was right along with it. This was the test that counted (according to my brother in law) so the screen resolution and speed was awarded to the iPad 4, but only by a hair.Another issue I thought I would have was the special offers it comes with. I read many reviews of people who hated them and felt like they were renting the device rather than owning it and opted to pay to remove them. I thought I would test it out and if it really bothered me then I would spend the $15 or so and be rid of them. This has not bothered me one bit. The ads only play when the screen is locked and swiftly go away when you swipe to unlock the screen. If anything, I sometimes find myself starting at the beautiful screen. So if you're thinking of buying the Kindle try the offers first and save yourself a few bucks.The obvious difference for me was the different app store, which was another issue I thought I would have. The app store is chock full of choices in apps and I didn't miss the apple app store one bit. Oh, and one thing I love which apple doesn't offer is the coins that the Kindle comes with (500 coins which translates to $5), and if you buy certain apps you get more coins that you can then use for apps. I downloaded an app and then received an email letting me know I received one dollar towards mp3 songs. Not bad if you ask me. I just wish I knew which apps offered what but I'm sure the more I play around with it the more I will learn.I also have to say shipping was fabulous. I ordered this Dec 19 and selected free shipping and received it before Christmas. Great service which is what I expect from Amazon.All in all, I love my Kindle even though I haven't tried many gadgets it offers. Also, the fact that this tablet doesn't have a camera is a non issue to me since I hardly ever use my other tablets for the camera. They're just too big and bulky for that. That's what real cameras and phones are for.To other iPad users out there, the lack of a home button took a little getting used to. There is a swipe thing you have to do to get the home button on the screen and that will redirect you to the very different home page of the Kindle, and that too took a little getting used to but after a few days it becomes natural.If you're thinking of getting this tablet, get it.

My son plays Rovio products that scan in Telepods through the camera... no camera...no good.I'm sure this is a fine product, as the specs all match up to the previous gen Fire HD, but no camera, and no HDMI output, mean this is NOT a next gen Fire HD.... it's a next gen Fire......", "Title": "WARNING WARNING WARNING...", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R2B5VOA3IGCPJF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the original Kindle Fire when it first came out. It had some errors and its problems, but I was really impressed with it and loved it! The Kindle Fire was my absolute favourite tablet and e-reader. So when it was stolen, I was determined to get another one at some point.Well, as an early Christmas gift, I got this one. To say the least, I'm more then a little disappointed.Starting with the outside design, I don't like the slanted sides. I don't like how when its plugged in, the plug sticks out and upward towards the screen instead of towards the back. It's annoying honestly. Not to mention, instead of the plugin being in the center, it's towards the left side. So it's right in the way of where/how I hold the tablet. That makes it even worse. I'm constantly bumping into it.Personally, the locations of the power and volume buttons aren't very convenient either. The power button on almost all products and every other product I own is on the top. For the Kindle now it's on the bottom. So I'm constantly forgetting and having to look for it. Annoying and inconvenient. The volume buttons aren't easy accessible either. As again, you have to look for them. You can't just keep your hands where they are, holding the device, the reach up with a finger to effortlessly turn the volume up or down. Nooooo. You can't do that. The volume buttons are at the top of the device, completely out of easy reach.Moving onto the software, I continue. I'll start with the over flow of apps that sit at the bottom of the screen. On the original Kindle Fire, they displayed 1 row of mini apps at the bottom of the screen and by swiping up, you could display more. Now you display between 2 and 3 rows that fade out. It's too much and looks so cluttered.Next comes the most annoying part of the entire product. The lovely suggestions bar (that sits under the main carousel) that I can't seem to find any way to get rid of! To me, this is like advertising. Which honestly, I thought I paid extra to get rid of anyway! Guess not. I don't want suggestions for new apps and things to download. I wish I could turn it off, but I sure can't find any way to do so. I absolutely can't stand things like this. I would love this if it was only to be seen in the app store, but it's not. So no, I'm not okay with it and no, I don't like it.I will give Amazon credit for adding a \"Help\" app. I haven't yet used the app, but I have opened it and looked around. I absolutely love the idea of having this app! To be able to get help right on the tablet is a great idea that I think more tablets should have. I no longer have to open my laptop to contact someone, I can do it right from my tablet, which I think is an absolutely wonderful idea! I love this new addition the most!Moving on to the \"Games\" tab. I don't like how there's no way to re-organize how the apps are displayed. Why can't I display the apps like before where you could choose to list them by \"most played\", \"title\", \"installation\", etc. We could also choose to display grid view or list view (this is the current set up). It's annoying how I can't display things the way I want. It's like you too AWAY customizations when you should be adding more.In the \"Apps\" tab though we can display the apps as just buttons with the name underneath. It takes up less room and I like it better this way. I don't understand why we can't do the same with the apps in the \"Games\" tab.Next we go to the \"Books\" tab, which is probably the best set up out of all the tabs. However, I don't like how there is no way to delete books from the device itself. Like the Oxford Dictionaries that the device comes with. Two books here that I'll never, ever use, but can't delete like I could on the original Kindle Fire.For someone who doesn't use the \"Music\", \"Videos\", \"Newsstand\", or \"Audiobooks\" tabs, it would be nice if we could simply choose not to display them. I haven't and know already that I never will use these tabs and I find them to take up space. I wish we could choose to remove tabs that we don't want displayed or don't plan to use. I think it would be nice to be able to reorganize the order of the tab as well.Finally, the last tab, the \"Docs\" tab. I use this tab quite often myself. Again, they got rid of an important setting. We're no longer given the option of grid view, instead we're stuck with the never-ending list view. For someone who has TONS of docs uploaded onto the device, having a list view doesn't work out too well as I have to scroll FOREVER to get through the list since it's so long.I have also noticed that all the book covers that we once part of my docs have been removed or at least, they no longer display. I find this annoying as well. I went through hours of work to make sure everything had a book cover and no none of them show up or are displayed. It's annoying.Don't get me wrong. I love the Kindle Fire. The set up and operating system is unique and that's what I loved about it most. However, I'm very disappointed in the latest version. If I could, I'd have gone back and purchased the original Kindle Fire that I loved. I had so few complaints about it. This, I have a love hate relationship with it. I love the kindle fire, but I hate the changes. I thought with the latest version, the tablet would get better and more amazing. I thought I'd love it even more then I did. I never thought that I'd fall out of love with a product I used to be addicted too and now annoys me.This was a real disappointment.", "Title": "Love and Hate", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Robert Alexander", "ReviewID": "R3338J3JQHKR48", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Goes into a restart loop and I can't use it randomly.

So you may get a big surprise when your child starts buying apps on your account and there isn't anything you can do to prevent it.  Amazon will tell you that you can turn off purchases in Parental Control, but it requires a password to exit Free Time, so the scenario here is that if your child wants to go from playing Free Time games and reading, to watching a Netflix movie, you must either give him the password to exit Free Time, so that he will still be able to buy all the apps he wants on  your account, or he must come to you to enter the password to exit Free Time.  An organization as big as Amazon should be able to make a software fix that would allow you (the parent) to control the capabilities of  your child on the Kindle.  I've read forum discussions going back a ways and this seems to have been a problem for a while and Amazon doesn't seem interested in fixing it.Update:  Stephanie from Amazon Kindle support was kind enough to contact me and help me resolve the issue with the One Click within Kindle Free Time.

Only my wife's Kindle Paperwhite is handier.The Amazon apps store has a good selection and it is easy to side-load apps like Firefox that aren't available from Amazon. Overall, though, I find the included Silk browser and the e-mail app to be sufficient for my uses.Amazon's handling of books, music, and videos is elegant, simple, and flexible. I like that the content \"lives\" on Amazon's servers and the tablet can download and what I'm reading right now and keep the rest on the cloud. This is especially important with the 8 GB model. The memory can fill quickly, so Amazon's method of managing it is very helpful.The Kindle Free Time app is great! My two sons each have their own profile. I have in-app purchasing turned off system-wide, but I believe that's the default for Free Time. I have run into a few apps for children that do not work well with Free Time -- the screen flipping upside down is the most common problem, but locking rotation before going into the Free Time environment seems to help. I've noticed that for some apps, when I load them into Free Time, they seem to download and install separately, so I end up with three copies of a particular app -- one for me and one each for the boys. Again, be careful about memory usage.Videos and movies look great on the screen, and the sound is very good. I use a program called Handbrake on my desktop computer to rip DVD movies to a digital format, copy the digital file to the Kindle with the USB cable, and then use the VLC+ app to view the movies. Feature-length movies usually come in at 750 MB to 1 GB, so two or so are easy to store and view.I wish this model came with a camera, but overall it's an excellent value.", "Title": "An excellent device that does exactly what it's supposed to do.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "K.

Mine is fine. I imagine the packaging may have contributed to any defective or damaged ones, as it is most certainly not protected against rough handling in transit. I really enjoy it, it's not too slow or bogged down even with the special offers, the picture quality is good, and it handles everything I need it to. Great battery life, even when I have a million things running, unless I have the brightness at full and then it drains it more quickly. But, even then, it's not bad battery life by far (several hours on brightest - 8ish -, even more on lower - 10ish -). The only down side, really, is that you're limited to the amazon app store, which has far fewer apps than the google store, but seeing as how this is an amazon device, it's expected. I also find the charging port a bit wonky, the angle is odd, but that's really just a preference thing.

A testimony in itself. I recently purchased this Kindle model after the \"Black Monday\" madness, and have had a month to evaluate it. Overall, I am exceedingly pleased.As advertised, Kindle Fire can be used for a variety of purposes, including watching movies and listening to music. I have an older Kindle (with the small keyboard), that works just fine for reading books, which I still consider as its primary usage. So why upgrade?  The touch screen, the color, the HD for the pictures, and the ease with which a display can be changed from vertical to horizontal mode are all significant improvements. As an additional plus, I found this Wi-Fi enabled device handy for connecting to the web, and the Silk browser, developed especially for the Kindle, to be easy to use for accessing email... and even ordering more products from Amazon!In addition to the Kindle itself, it really is strongly advisable to purchase a cover for it. Fortunately, I am a member of the Vine program, and had the sturdy protection of a Belkin Chambray Cover for Kindle Fire HDX (will only fit Kindle Fire HDX 7\"), Blacktop provided to me for review purposes, and my 5-star review of it is posted. I still love reading books the old-fashioned way, turning the pages in hand, and consider a room without a bookcase ill-furnished. But it is hard to beat the very handy storage and ready reference that the Kindle facilitates. For viewing books with pictures, particularly art books, I'd go with the larger Kindle HD 8.9\". But for travel, particularly backpacking, say from town-to-town, so that the Kindle can be kept charged, this is the model I would go with.I consider myself \"tech-savvy,\" but on the other hand, I must see a clear purpose for the latest \"gadget\" before I purchase it. For example, when relatively cheap, hand-held GPS devices became commercially available in the mid-90's, and I was often travelling in \"unmapped territories,\" I immediately understood its utility and purchased one, and it did revolutionize my ability to travel in the desert safely. Likewise with the Kindle series of products. In terms of storage of books, and portability, it is revolutionary. So too is the cost of obtaining information.

And boy does he love it.Now, I realize some people dislike the amazon software, but for prime members like my family, the software really simplifies things.  When my son wants to watch a movie, he just goes to the home screen and selects videos.  If he wants to download a children's book, he goes to the home page and selects books and picks one.  Same thing for apps.  Plus, the parental controls are easily accessible for me and my wife, and we can prohibit certain content.  Easy for him and easy for us.For those people who adore their ipads (my oldest son is an apple junkie) and rave about their unbeatable speed and refinement, I understand your sentiment.  However, for the price paid and the features, I personally prefer kindle fire hd.  Fires look great, work great for what my family uses them for (books, video, apps, and web), cost a lot less, and have enough choices in the app store to keep us all happy.

I emailed Amazon about the issue.  I asked for a list of magazines that DO SUPPORT the text only version.

We have an IPad and you can download movies from Amazon onto the IPad, which works great for us.  We were looking for a tablet for the kids and came across the Kindle Fire HD.  After getting it setup, I can say I am impressed with what you get for the price.First things first, it isn't an IPad, but it is pretty good.  You don't have access to all the apps that IPad has but what it lacks in apps it fully makes up for in extra content.  You get immersed in everything that Amazon has.  Since we are Prime members (something I highly recommend getting), we can download Prime movies and TV shows right to the Kindle Fire at no extra charge (something you can't do with Netflix).  Prime has a very large library, especially for kids.The next thing that I found great is the size of the downloaded movies.  An HD movie takes just over a 1/2 GB of memory and a SD takes just under a 1/2 GB.  You get the option of the amount of quality.  If you want the full HD, you can download it.  If you want to cram as many movies on it as you can for traveling for your kids, you can do that too.  After downloading three movies and an episode of \"Bubble Guppies\" for our kids we still had about 10GB of memory left on a 16GB tablet.  You can't do that with an IPad.The Free Time settings are awesome.  You setup accounts for your kids and set what content they view or play with (apps, movies, books, etc.) and then put the device in Free Time mode and it is password locked.  You can setup an account for each kid.  On top of Free Time, you can subscribe to Free Time Unlimited which is additional access to books, movies and apps.  We are doing the trial right now and see how much our kids use it.  I will give an update later.With Kindle Fire, you can share books and be a part of the lender's club which includes some pretty good titles (Harry Potter, Hunger, etc.).Lastly, all the major stuff that you use an IPad for, you can do on the Kindle Fire HD.Are right time for complaints.  It is a little more sluggish than the IPad when opening up a new App, but not enough for me to care. There isn't any sluggishness when it comes to playing games or scrolling.Next, I wish they had Google services.  Not going to happen.

I bought it as a replacement for my old Kindle Keyboard.  I'd had the keyboard version for 3 or 4 years and was starting to have issues with charging and keys. Most of the time it needed to be reset to get it to charge. With several of the keys starting wear out I decided it was time to upgrade.  It's still going to be my back up.The new Fire is my first taste of touch screen, so the adjustment is 'interesting'!  I've been reading a book with it, played a couple of apps and have downloaded a weather app.  All seem to have gone smoothly and work pretty well.  I've just added a couple of favorite games (from keyboard and pc) so will see how that goes.  I found linking my email accounts easy, and downloaded a word doc from email without issue.The battery life is way shorter than with the keyboard, but I think that may be due to having kept a wifi connection while I've been experimenting.  I only really used it with the keyboard for downloads then switched it off.It may not be the most sophisticated kindle or tablet available, but the price is right (I opted for the extra charge for no special offers), the screen resolution is great, and so far it's been easy to use.Update - Nov 7:Not using the wifi so much has improved the length of time the battery charge lasts.  Screen clarity and responsiveness are great and the graphics on the apps I have downloaded are good.  I do find I sometimes try to push the side 'page turn' buttons which were on my Kindle keyboard, which don't exist on the Fire HD, but that's just me getting used to touch screen technology! :)  Page turning is inconsistent from e-books to downloaded docs.

So buying the Kindle Fire w/ SO saves you $15. But that's not all. Your Kindle Fire will have SO displayed on the lock screen. You can also see these offers when you click on the 'Offers' button on the home page. Many of these offers are available only on select models such as the 2013 Kindle Fire HD 7.

Buying the models with Special Offers gives you the potential for great deals and major savings. Maybe not all the SO are this great, but you have to admit, these deals were unbeatable (I'm still kicking myself for missing out on the $19 Kindle Paperwhite). Afraid you'll miss seeing these SO on your Kindle's screen? No problem. Amazon allows you to sign up for text notifications that will alert you when a SO is coming up.If you do buy the Special Offers and you later decide you no longer want to see the SO on your Kindle, you have the option of paying the extra $15 or $20 (can't remember which) to opt out of Special Offers.The Special Offers models are definitely worth considering if you plan to purchase a Kindle Fire.", "Title": "Why you should consider the version with Special Offers", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Author": "Leslie H.", "ReviewID": "R3F39844MNY4KG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use my Kindle for email, web surfing, and I do a lot of my college work on it.

The KindleFire by itself is an amazing tablet for the price, even with push ads, but no one in their right mind would create an Amazon account (even with a prepaid credit card to spend)and hand it over to a kid to waste said funds within 5 minutes buying apps like \"Virtual High 5\" or in-game \"bonuses\" for games they'll lose interest in within 20 minutes, then ask for MORE \"credits\" to buy the app they REALLY wanted....or maybe that's what Amazon was banking on by selling it so cheaply...hmmmm.I bought as a gift for my 12 year old, not knowing it's tied to my shopping account-even with parental controls on (the \"Shop\" menu option is permanent-cannot be disabled).

When I saw the banner on Amazon.com announcing the new tablet at the new price, I figured it couldn't hurt to give the Kindle a try as a secondary tablet for our son (2.5 yrs old). We were most drawn to the new Amazon FreeTime Unlimited feature and also liked the smaller form compared to our full size iPad 3.My first impression of the Kindle is that it just isn't as \"snappy\" as iOS. In iOS, clicking on an app immediately launches it and it's very easy to exit out with a click of the home button. In the Kindle, I've had apps crash on loading or take a few clicks to launch. It just doesn't feel as responsive as the iPad at all. Also, closing an app involves swiping to open the menu and clicking home. Not the biggest deal, but for our 2.5 year old the iPad is much more intuitive and doesn't lag when pressing the home button to quit an app.While that is what I dislike about the experience, overall the purchase is a solid one. For the price, this can't be beat at less than half the price of an iPad mini which is the same size screen. The screen and form factor is great. It doesn't have that iPad metallic slickness but feels more like a gadget and is easier to hold.The best thing as a parent is the Amazon FreeTime app service though, $2.99 per month for any app/book I want? That's less than the price of one iPad app a month. While the app selection isn't overwhelming as an adult, as a kid the amount of available books is awesome. Also, the limiting feature of the Kindle was another huge draw for us. It allows you to selectively set limits for each activity such as 1 hr of video, 1 hr of apps, but unlimited time reading books. Once you're \"in\" the Amazon FreeTime app it also requires the parental password to get back to the Kindle home screen, making your child stuck in the FreeTime app with it's parental control limits in place (this is a GOOD thing!).As a techie Dad I'm slightly disappointed in the Kindle OS performance (why does the Thomas App crash on loading?) not being snappy. As a parent it's an amazing inexpensive screen device. I just wish the Otterbox which I preordered the same day as the Kindle HD came out was actually available (it seems to be delayed and still shows as shipping 2 weeks after the Kindle HD finally arrived instead of same day).", "Title": "Good Budget Tablet & Perfect for Parents", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "R.

Three of the applications on my list of non-functioning software for the new Kindle Fire HD are now working (Simpsons: Tapped Out, Ice Age Village, & Retro Defense), and it looks like more are on the way.

When/if they correct this, I will update this review. But, regardless, as things stand right now, I thought I should warn others about this new Kindle Fire.  I was super-excited about this new Kindle Fire. I was going to replace my original Kindle Fire with it. I even paid for 1-day shipping, pre-ordered it, and everything.I was ASTONISHED to receive it, and find out that my favorite applications I had been using for quite a while on the Kindle Fire (original) did not work on the new Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I know that Amazon does not make the applications, but they were perfectly able to work with their software partners and ensure that at least all applications in the top-100 lists were ready to go with the new Kindle Fire! As things stand right now, the new Kindle Fire HD 7\" is sitting unused in the box it came in, and the cover I ordered for it hasn't even been opened. I will return everything for a refund if they don't get the software availability and functionality issues sorted out in the next 2 weeks.In the meantime, save your money, and temper down your expectations for this new tablet. It has promise, but as with all hardware, it is USELESS without software to run on it. When/if they get the software issue sorted out, I will be more than happy to use it.

I've been using it for less than 24 hours, so this won't be the most thorough review. This is my first Kindle Fire, so I won't be comparing it to the previous generations. I will post an update when I get a better idea of the battery life, but I currently estimate it to last about ten hours. This is based on about three hours of use and how much battery remained. I recommend the 16GB version if you are not planning on getting all or most of your content through Amazon, or if you don't always have access to Wi-Fi for Amazon's Cloud drive. The 8GB version should be fine for people who don't need a lot of storage or who can take advantage of the Amazon Cloud.Pros- I like the design.- Excellent screen for streaming videos or watching videos- Reading is intuitive- I love text-to-speech- No problems with internet dropping. I haven't had any issues with the built in Browser.- Cloud is easy to use- Charged via Micro-USB cable so you probably have about ten compatible chargers lying around your house.Cons- Default music player is kind of annoying, and I haven't found any good alternatives.-Kindle OS is not as user-friendly as Android. No Google Play means you'll be digging hard for alternatives to some of your favorite Android apps or installing them manually.- After my initial setup, I encountered a recurring error where the device would crash when booting up.

Not the same as the original Fire HD", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Starfishin \"Starfishin\"", "ReviewID": "R3O1IQEGVN4X2U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm posting this after reading a lot of comments from people who are a bit confused about what this \"new\" Kindle Fire HD offers. Maybe you're like me -- after buying my daughter a Kindle Fire HD last summer, and \"borrowing\" it a few times, I fell in love and bought my own \"old\" version KFHD. I can't remember the last time I've been so unreservedly enthusiastically about a purchase. However, if you've been looking at a friend's Kindle Fire HD for some months now, and think you're going to buy a new, improved or upgraded model today -- you're NOT. Sure, you're paying a less money than an entry-level KFHD cost a month ago -- but you're also getting a lot less Kindle for that money.As people are beginning to figure out, this stripped down version doesn't have a camera (I know, I know -- read the description. But you really can't fault people for assuming the \"new\" version would have the same features are the old.) I really thought that was a feature I didn't need, but as it turns out I love the camera in my Kindle Fire HD -- it makes it unbelievably easy to curl up in a chair and Skype.  I've also tried it once for video conferencing -- again, much easier than using a laptop. If you use Skype -- or if you think there's any possibility you might want to use it (Grandchildren? Children away at college? Elderly parents?) you really want this feature.The baseline new KFHD has half the memory --  8 GB vs 16 GB -- of the old. Skimping on memory on a device as versatile as this is shortsighted, to say the least. It's pretty funny -- when the old KFHD came out, Amazon explained why you NEEDED at least 16 GB this way: \"We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB.\" So suddenly HD content doesn't require as much storage?Some people consider the Kindle Fires a tablet substitute -- I think it depends what you want a tablet for. I don't think any of the Fires are for serious work. Light work, social media, e-mail and entertainment, yes. My old KFHD has unbelievably good speakers -- if the complaints about the speakers on the new KFHD are to be believed, then that's a big strike against it as an entertainment device (if I'm home alone watching, why should I have to go to the hassle of using earbuds just so I can get acceptable sound quality?)No HDMI port on the new KFHD? OK....lousy internal speakers, can't connect to tv or monitor....how are these improvements?It is nice that Amazon stopped cheaping out and included a power cord with the new KFHD -- on the other hard, it wasn't an expense for many people, who simple used the power cord from other Kindle devices.While I've still got my fingers crossed that I won't encounter the battery/charging issues many people report at the one year mark, for now I am quite satisfied with my old version KFHD -- and I'm convinced it's a superior product to the new version. If you'd like to compare the new version with the prior version, go here: B0083PWAPW(and Amazon -- if you're listening: On the advice of someone who works for an airline, I \"named\" my (3 differentversions!) Kindle e-readers with a version of my first name and my phone number so that if I lost it (and the airlines apparently have a astounding collection of lost Kindles)the finder could locate me. I keep my KFHD locked, because unlocked anyone would have access to my entire life. However, that also means there's no way to identify me if I lose it.  It would be great to have the owner's contact information displayed even when the device is locked.

I was really on the fence about buying it as I think the 2012 HD is a better device. I have to say I am really disappointed with new design. (Note that the current HD is really a successor to the 2012 Fire). First of all the 2013 Fire HD is slightly wider than the original Fire which makes it harder to hold even though this newer model is lighter. My first Fire had a classic tablet shape with the power button and charging port on the bottom and it held up really well to daily use for the past several years.  On the original fire, when you charge it, there is a light that tells you it is charging. The 2013 Fire HD does not have light so you are forced to keep the HD on when charging so you can keep swiping onto the main page to read the incredibly tiny battery indicator. Due to the weird slanted sides, the charging cable plugs in at an angle.  This design leaves the charging cable in a position where it will be easily damaged so I am very confident that it will not last more than six months.  (Sadly you will want an extended warranty on this).The Fire HD has some accessibility features but they are extremely poorly thought out.  First all, the silk browser (unlike that the original Fire) will not let you change the fonts and font sizes.  While the Settings Menu has an option called \"Use Large Font Size\" I have found no instance of any larger fonts being used for menus or settings or headings or anything in any section of the Fire or the silk browser.There is one Accessibility Feature that ALL users should be forewarned about to not play with ever as it is very buggy.  \"Screen Reader\" option is a feature that is supposed to read the text on the pages to you. However, if you turn it on with out realizing it, you will end up getting locked out of your device unless you are able to PRECISELY swipe with two finger the lock button (it took tech support's help and twenty tries before I could get back in) and then you will need to double tap items that are \"highlighted\" with this tiny border around to select them until you can get back to the Accessibility Menu.) For whatever reason, it is very hard to get the HD to \"register\" that you are doing the right actions.  I am both hearing impaired and visually impaired so I had a very hard time fixing this problem as the highlighting is not easy to see. Note that restarting your Fire will NOT \"erase\" this setting, you must use the alternate swiping and taping meant for this Screen Reader mode to go back into the settings menu to fix it.  If you do end up with something that seems like somewhat like a frozen screen after a restart, turn up the volume and see if it is describing the page verbally. If so, then you turned on this feature and it is NOT that your screen froze but rather that you are not use the correct swiping methods needed when this feature is turned on.Being visually and hearing impaired, I am unable to use this feature as I can't hear the descriptions well enough (very mechanical voice) and the \"highlighting\" of selections is nothing more than a one pixel wide colored square around the icon or label. If you are visually impaired and plan to use this, I strongly recommend that you work with someone with very good eyesight and hearing to test this after checking Amazon's help section for detailed instructions as there are no onscreen instructions. I have hand-eye coordination issues and I found the alternate method of selecting things in this (and in the Screen Magnifier option\" very hard to use and remember. The whole thing is very complicated and not user friendly.I tried the email and gave up.  While it worked with my email provider, there were no font settings at all in the email so I could not enlarge the display size of the fonts in the emails or within the app itself.I did not notice any significant improvement loading pages as compared to the original Fire. the HD does not remember my preferences for clearing browser data so every time, you need to go into settings and select each setting. That is really annoying.Hearing impaired persons should note that there is section for setting a variety of closed captioning settings for video that have CC on a browser page including fonts and sizes.  This is different from the setting to turn CC on or off in the main Settings page for the whole device. However, the Amazon Video app itself does not have any CC settings within its settings page.I strongly prefer reading ebooks on the original fire over the HD.  The HD does not have true \"white\" background - rather to my eyes, it is an off white which means it has less contrast and was tiring to read.I did not get the 10 hours or so of battery life that I believe the HD is supposed to get.  And the plug part of the cord got very  hot and I had to unplug it after about two hours and let it cool down.In a lot of places, the HD uses writing in a light grey color. It is very hard to read and all of the menus in the various Amazon apps are small and hard to read.I had also hoped that since the 2013 HD was designed after the lending library was introduced, that it would have a way to browse the entire lending library. Nope. And you can't go onto your PC and shop for them even to read on the Fire, you actually have to stumble around the books store on your Fire and try to find the books you want and not the 20 or so featured books they want you borrow. Very annoying and the lack of usefulness of this feature is good reason to not order Prime again.I have not really tried watching the Amazon Prime video on the HD as there is no way to set closed captioning (other than on/off) yet.  I think I would prefer to use a Roku than try to watch on a screen where I can't change the fonts, colors and sizes.  While I could have bought an HDX to use its miracast feature, I would have then had spend more money on a device for the miracast to put it up on my tv and more money for a warranty.  I am not sold on the miracast feature and strongly prefer an hdmi cable connection for simplicity.One of the reason I picked this model is that it has no front facing camera. The lack of camera is one of the better features of the first Fire and the HD.  It is one of the reasons  I did not get HDX.I am very frustrated about the volume and power buttons being inaccessible. They should be on the edges not the back.this of course means I can't use any of my existing cases!!  I am constantly flipping it over to find the buttons because there is no easy way to the tell the top from the bottom and so I keep ending up pressing the wrong button if I don't actually look. It is annoying and totally poor design. There is no slot for pushing in a paperclip to reset the Fire, instead you have to use one or two different reset methods that involve holding down the power button for 30 seconds. And getting to the safe mode apparently requires pressing one of the volume buttons and the start button at the same time! There is no expandable storage at all so if you are going someplace where you don't have access to wifi, you better clear some space on the tablet.Like other reviewers, I have found that the HD does not always respond to swipes and other motions well.", "Title": "Very Disappointing and frustrating experience after a week", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Author": "thinker", "ReviewID": "R15SN78ZX354ZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good small tablet.

Amazon has done a great job of making it very user friendly, and integrating it with your amazon account - making apps and movies that you purchase (weather from your device or your PC) available to your Kindle.shockingly though, they did not FULLY integrate with other services such as their cloud storage (not the \"cloud\" that is your account purchases, but a separate service amazon offers called \"amazon cloud storage\"). an app is available from amazon, but it is INCOMPATIBLE (what?!) with kindle - amazons flagship mobile device.  while movies that you have purchased via digital download from amazon are easily accessible, there is no native way to import other movies, or clips that you own.  the only way i was able to play other media was by putting them onto my PC, then transferring them over manually with the kindle connected to my machine.  then, i had to download a third-party video playing app to access and play the clipps. way too much hassle for something that should be a basic function.BUT THIS IS NOT WHY I TOOK OFF TWO STARS!!!!THE reason i gave it the lower rating is because there are a few real problems with this device that have yet to be seriously addressed by Amazon.1)  there is a small chance that your brand new kindle (right out of the box) will have a defective screen - that is, it will be totally unresponsive to touch.  this happened to me, and upon searching the net i found i was not alone.  the only thing that can be done is have it sent in and replaced.2)  there is a chance your kindle will lock up and become inoperable, stuck in a loop at the boot screen.  this is a well documented problem that has plagued all of their kindle models, and also happened to my mothers kindle.  when the problem first arose, i looked to google for a solution, but only found repeated recomendations to \"reboot\" the device by holding in the power button for 30 seconds to a full minute, then leaving it off for a while, and turning it back on again.  when that failed, i called amazon for help - and they immediately asked if i had \"tried rebooting it\".  he walked me through it, and when it failed he sent me to someone more experienced... who then prompted me to \"try rebooting the device\".  AGAIN he walked me through the process, and again it failed, so then he sent me over to a kindle tech expert of some sort (sorry, its been a while).... who then introduced himself and asked me (NO, SERIOUSLY!!!) \"have you tried rebooting the device?\"...if it weren't happening to me - if this was a character in a movie or something i would have just busted up laughing at this point. unfortunately, it WAS happening to me, so all i could do is silently shake my head in disbelief.the sad truth is, if anything happens to your kindle the only tool these guys have is to have you reboot it.thats it.thats all they got.no file patching, no way to get inside and clean things up.  all they can do is ask if you've tried rebooting it.if that fails (and from what i've seen it rarely works), the only other option is to send it in and have it replaced.", "Title": "ok for what it is", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Author": "Elena Moreno", "ReviewID": "R35WPHJAMGID1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th kindle..,I bought it because of the text to speech.

I ordered the Fire HD 7-inch with 8 GB and special offers. Didn't open it for two months because I debated whether I really needed a tablet. Opened it and loved it. I haven't stopped using it since. I use it every day to check email, and surf the web, and play games. The web browser is not the best, but hey, it's not a computer. Also, make sure to switch the search to Google, instead of Bing. I use the parental control to prevent accidental in-app purchases, so that's a great function as well. There are a ton of free apps and books. The free books are mostly crap but once in a while, you stumble on something decent. I mostly download pdfs and just move them over to the device for reading.The home screen is very well organized, all the tabs are at the top which categorizes your apps. I've used Netflix and TED on it, it's very fluid, and the sound is great whether or not you use earphones. It's very light (so if you drop it on your face while laying down, you don't hurt anything) and the size is perfect, I can fit it in my very tiny side bag. With heavy use, my Kindle's battery lasts about a day and a half, always on or sleeping.It has not a lot of user memory, compared to the Nexus which is around the same price, but it is a solid device. I don't believe it comes with a manual, but everyone I've spoken to online for Amazon has been amazing.

I also sometimes have trouble accessing movies that I've downloaded.  This could be a result of the internet speed of where I'm using the tablet, though.  At home I rarely have issues.  However, I did think the tablet was defective when I first got it because I did not realize (for the first two weeks) how to shut it down correctly.  If you press the button and wait for it to ask you to shut down, this is the proper way to shut it off.  I didn't know this at first, though, and must not have been shutting it down correctly (perhaps was only putting it to sleep).  At any rate, the battery kept dying and I had to recharge it daily.  Now that I've discovered how to shut it down correctly, the battery lasts longer.  I mostly use this while walking on the treadmill at the gym.  I watch hour-long episodes of classic tv shows which I've downloaded.  I also use this at night in bed to read a few newspapers and to check Facebook.  I've also used it to watch QVC in the mornings while getting ready for work. I've downloaded a Solitaire game and a Sudoku game and I'll also play these at night before going to sleep.  There's even a police scanner app that I've downloaded so whenever I hear sirens in the neighborhood I'll turn this on.

I waited until now after she had & I got a chance to play around with it to write a review on it.That said, this a good entry-level tablet. My mom, got this mainly to read E-books, while I use it to go online. In terms of features, I'm highlighting the following:E-Books- The screen is very bright for reading E-books. When you 1st buy it, it already comes with a number of e-books-mainly dictionaries. You can choose to add them to the Kindle proper. Otherwise, they'll stay in your Kindle account located in your Amazon account & you can't removed them. If you're planning to use this mainly for reading, I'd recommend getting the Kindle with as much storage space as possibleE-mail- My mom & I haven't used it yet, but the Kindle also has an account with G-mail.IMDb Movies & TV- Kindle Edition. If you're into movies & TV shows, this a great feature. You can find info on actors, movies, TV programming & even watch movie trailers.Web- In comparison to the 5-year old PC in my home (from which the Kindle's getting its net access via a wireless router) the internet is very fast. I can watch videos from YT in HD without having issues with the flash player.Music- The music from your Amazon Cloud Player can be played on your Kindle plus you can buy MP3 music from Amazon By the way, there's also an Amazon icon where you can go to the main shop for non-music oriented items.Apps & Games- The Kindle can also play apps & games, but like e-books, make sure your tablet has the space to store them.Overall, my mom & I like this tablet. My only issue is that the Kindle battery life is a bit short before it needs charging.

Sadly it has major power problems.  I'm on my second kindle and it seems obvious I'll be on my third within a week.  They just turn off.  My first one was turning off all the time and then having trouble turning back on.  So they sent me a new (refurbished) one.  The new one turns off too.  I'll just be reading or working on an app and it turns off.  The second one immediately turns back on but then is in reboot mode that takes several minutes to complete.  The costumer service is rather nice and they've been working with me and I am quite confident that they will send me a third soon.  But meanwhile they wanted me to try restoring it.  That didn't work.  Then I restored it to factory settings, that hasn't worked.  I feel confident it is a hardware, not a software problem, but they are required to try all the software fixes before they'll send me another.  Each of these resets means that I lose all my data.  My books and my apps are on the cloud and they can come back.  But everything has to be downloaded again, one at a time.  Each app has to be downloaded one at a time.  Each app that needs you to log in or get a password needs to be redone.  I lose all the data I've put into the apps.  I lose all my scores on my games.  Even the games that are supposed to save your score with the amazon system lose my scores.  It is really frustrating.  I had just downloaded a library app and sorted all my books this weekend and the new reset lost all that sorting.  I have to start over.  I would hope I will eventually get a kindle without power problems.  I assume they must make some that work.  But I'm on my 4th complete reset in 3 months.  My kindle is not exposed to any harsh treatment.  No children are playing with it.  I am an adult woman who mostly uses it to read.

Patterson \"I love reading and I'm al...", "ReviewID": "R29SESDANKVZKD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took advantage of Amazon's 'try before you buy' offer and had the Kindle Fire for a month before having to pay for it.  I decided I would definitely want to keep it and paid the price (a quite reasonable one) happily once the month was up.  They gave me email warning that the time was approaching, by the way, which I thought was a good idea.  Lots of times, people forget they have to make a decision on some time-limited offer and only pay the price because they missed the deadline.  It's a good business model to make sure people mean to buy the Kindle rather than regret having bought it by accident.The Kindle Fire has much to love about it!  In many ways, it's easier to use than my iPad (which is saying something!) and, for that reason, as well as the fact that it can read e-books to me, that I wanted to keep it.  I have a cervical spine injury which makes it difficult (if not impossible) for me to read bound paper books without a great deal of pain but I have always been an avid reader.  I would do almost anything to be able to read several books a week like I used to.Along came e-books and audiobooks to save the day!  The thing is, anything that keeps me riveted intellectually or emotionally, leads to the same awful pain since I don't move much while in my head.  So, e-books must be kept to a minimum and audiobooks used more often.  The problem there is that audiobooks are usually only available for the most popular books and, truth be told, they are often not my favorites.  Luckily, most books I want to read are available as e-books so what I needed was something which would let me read e-books with my eyes as well as hear them with my ears.  The Kindle Fire is the first solution to this conundrum I've found which works well enough to suit me.The electronic voice which Kindles use to read documents and e-books to you is remarkably good.  It's not perfect, but it's good enough that I can bear hearing it read to me.  It does well with grammatical pauses and the pacing of the reading is good.  It stumbles over acronyms (like CIA, NSA, RIP - anything written without periods after each letter) or things like 'shhhh!'.  In those cases, it says 'sigh-ah', 'en-sah', 'rip' rather than initials, or 's' 'h' 'h' 'h' 'h' instead of 'shhhh'.  But, once I got used to that, I was able to understand everything the voice said.I am also assuming that Amazon, being Amazon, will continue to improve the voice(s) and the current one is good enough for the interim while I also look forward to whatever innovations are next.The size and weight of the Kindle Fire are amazingly useful to me and the screen size is good for reading and playing games.  The resolution of the screen is excellent.  It holds a charge really well - lasts for a really long time if it's in use, or turned off.It took me a while to get used to navigation on the Kindle Fire as I was used to the intuitive layout and navigation on Apple products.  They still win in that department.I am an Amazon Prime member and have been for many years.  I was looking forward to borrowing a book a month using the Kindle but, I have to admit, that it's been less than fun to find books I could borrow in the Kindle Lending Library.  Most of the things I want to borrow aren't eligible.  OTOH, it may help me expand my knowledge of authors I like through forcing me to choose between authors I'm not aware of yet.  lol  (I always see the silver lining.)The Wi-Fi is good but my husband had to give it a dedicated router before it was consistently great.  We had an old one lying around so that was okay for us but I hope people without that luxury (a spouse or oneself in IT) don't find it annoying that one can't always get a connection.The mini-USB charger works well.  It's easy and comfortable to watch videos and films or TV series on the Kindle Fire (the resolution is as good as on my iPad and iPhone - high praise).  As would seem obvious, anything to do with Amazon works the best.

It was even better than an actual store because I could not only read a synopsis but I could access customer ratings and reviews which were very helpful.

I could click on a title, peruse it, then essentially put it back on the shelf if it did not appeal to me.  With a back arrow I could revert to where I left off in the list of titles and continue to search.  This function was much like the placesavers our elementary librarians use to hold your place , while looking for one of interest, so that whatever you had select can be returned to its rightful place.  On the new Kindlefire HD when you replace the book you are thrown back to the very first book on what might be a 200 book list.  Very annoying and time consuming, not to mention a waste of batteries.  I liken this to being dragged back to the bookstore door every time you choose on of the shelf.  I liked everything else about it.  When I contacted Kindle support I was told it was a software problem and that they would work to resolve it.  They anticipated about 5 days.

I set up a separate account for my kids so our libraries and amazon needs will not get crossed and to basically keep our stuff out of their stuff.  my wife's Kindle is under my account.  i have since become a prime member, which is great, but only one account can use the service without paying for it twice.Why not use one account for all 3 kindles?  I order a lot of stuff on amazon.  if i put my kids on my account so they can use prime, than they can easily see what i am buying as well as every single thing I have ever bought.  Imagine a 7 year old figuring out that every present Santa ever brought was bought and paid through dads amazon account.  Kindle free time is a solution, but is really limited to what amazon thinks is appropriate.  my children's schools send home interactive websites and online learning tools.  if using kindle freetime, you must log out of freetime to view any online content, which brings me back to the whole account ownership, sharing and purchasing.The \"one click\" purchasing amazon features is an absolute scam to get you to buy more stuff.  On the kindles you can enact parental controls which require you to enter a password to purchase.  on my laptop it takes just one wrong stroke of the crumby mouse pad or touch screen and within 2-3 seconds you own it.  Usually only finding out about it when you get the credit card bill.

What I want to do in my review is wax philosophical about exactly why a Medicare-qualifying,  library card-toting, printed book-hoarding, lousy-visioned quasi-Luddite would buy a slippery, metal-and-plastic, skinny-minny, teeny-screened Kindle.Why?  Well,  I've had Prime for the past few months, and with it I get one free borrowed book per month that I hadn't been availing myself of.  Don't like to waste those bennies.  So I've been thinking about this a while.  Not to mention that I just read the whine by George Packer in the New Yorker (to which I subscribe, to my occasional chagrin) which accused CEO Jeff Bezos and his relentless.com of single-handedly destroying the publishing world as we've known it by walmartizing books (the ultimate insult, to an East Coast liberal).  Having been a loyal Amazon customer (off and on) since the early aughts, I immediately took umbrage.  Packer pushed me over the edge.  I  ordered a Kindle.  There are worse things to do with discretionary income. I'm a liberal too, and it's my ardent belief that democratizing books--making it easier for people to read, learn, think--is not an evil plot at all.  Besides, Mr. Bezos's long-time wife is a novelist.  How could he possibly think of books as nothing but widgets?So back to my new Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I was planning to swing conservative and just get a basic Kindle reader, but my computer-savvier  partner twisted my arm to order a more tricked-up model with more cool stuff included, along with an AmazonBasics stylus, I might add, to avoid the smudgies.  For the last couple days, I've been storing it in a spare makeup case enrobed in bubble wrap because I fear my fumbly fingers will drop the Fire before the faux leather Fintie Folio protective plain brown wrapper that I just ordered arrives.I really think that all books should be free.  Good ones impart knowledge, information, even wisdom, in whatever form they happen to be.  I have an enormous number of print books collected over many years that will stay with me until I die.  I'm also a regular library patron and will continue to be.  A lifetime ago, I did a gig as a schoolteacher/librarian in a third-world country, waiting months for boxes of books to arrive from American donors.  I can only imagine that it must be so much easier for needy students nowadays to get their hands on the written word, with the awesome resources of the Internet, devices like the Kindle and standard computers, and websites like Amazon.com available to them.UPDATE 2/24/14:  I've been playing with this Kindle for about a week, now with a spiffy and protective Fintie covering, and I've gotta say that the learning curve for some of its functions is a bit steep.  I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to bring up the 500,000+ books that Prime members can borrow in the Kindle Owners Lending Library.  Even visited the Kindle forum as well as watching a few instructional videos.  Every Kindle owner seems to have her pet method of getting there from here, and I'm still learning.  I almost considered returning the thing to Amazon the other day out of frustration, but I'm going to hang in there.  My senior brain just takes a little longer to pick up stuff.One question.

Both of my kids had the older gen and have gotten several years of great use out of them so I knew buying the newer version would be a good investment.  My kids LOVE their Kindles.  My son who's 8 loves downloading games and books while my daughter who is 5 enjoys downloading educational games and watching movies with my Prime membership.The display is crisp and clear with vivid colors.  The sound is great.  The thinner profile and lighter weight was a bit of an odd transition for the kids but they got use to them rather quickly.  I liken it to trading in your old flip phone for a thin, sleek smart phone, it feels weird at first but once you get use to it, it's great!I love the fact that the Kindles are resilient.  They have taken a beating and have held up exceptionally well AS LONG as they are in their cases.  My daughter dropped her older version while she was going down the brick stairs with the cover open and of course it cracked the display.  It was and is still usable but taught her a valuable lesson for when she got her new Kindle Fire HD 7\", she now knows to always walk with it closed in it's case and only use it when seated.I love the new power adapter/cord that comes with this version.  The older one had a tendency to have issues with connectivity due to internal soldering of the port.  This version seems to be very well made in comparison.Overall i'm very happy with our purchase and my kids have had countless hours of enjoyment.  I highly recommend Kindle Fire HD's to all my friends with kids.  I feel that it's a great alternative to a more expensive \"tablet\" such as an IPad and provides my kids with the same opportunity to play games, read books and provides them with hours of activities during long road trips or Doctor's visits.

The screen size and resolution is pretty fantastic, and the battery lasts a reasonably long time.The Silk browser is alright, though it would be better if there was some sort of ad-blocking tool that could be installed to it (like AdBlock on Chrome and Firefox), as the ads can be distracting, annoying, and make some pages more difficult to read and/or take a long time to load. The browser is great if you need to do something quickly, like look up movie times or check Facebook pages, and I like that it keeps track of all of your opened tabs, even if you exit the browser or power down your Kindle.Lastly, I would love if Kindle Fire owners could customize the splash screen(s) that display(s) when you are unlocking the Kindle. Some of the images are nice, but the ones that are advertisements are decidedly not and can get really old after awhile. Yes, it is a small irritation, and perhaps trivial, but Kindle Fire HDs aren't exactly cheap (yes, cheaper than comparable tablets, but still not cheap), so is it really so much to ask for a little customization options?

He tried to encourage me to get an ipad instead, but after lots of research I thought this Kindle was perfect for me. I have already exchanged one Kindle, but after several incidents of the new one freezing up, etc. I may be returning this one as well. Since I've had this problem I have discovered that a lot of people have the same problems. Some are already on their 4th replacement device. This leads me to believe that you all KNOW this product is defective, yet you continue to sell and replace non-working devices with the same bunk devices.This is unconscionable! You should send out email notices to everyone who purchased this model to let them know that this is a known problem with the device, and send everyone a new, next generation Kindle. You all send out emails, for everything else, and this would be the right thing to if you want to maintain relationships with your loyal customers. What I want you to personally do for me, is to replace my current Kindle Fire HD 7\" with which I continue to have problems, with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and provide me with a case comparable to the case I purchased for my current Kindle. I haven't seen reviews showing it has the problems my current model has. If you knowingly continue to sell the defective Kindles, as well as continue your current replacement practice with defective Kindles, I believe you all deserve a class action lawsuit. If I don't hear a reply from your office with suitable resolution, I intend to post this in the Kindle reviews. I'm sure there are more frustrated customers out there. Yes, you all have excellent customer service, and I enjoy the shopping convenience, but it doesn't make up for the game you are playing with the Kindle, the inconvenience of returning the product, setting up your replacement device again, and just having to deal with the issue PERIOD!

Then a store clerk showed me the Fire and Wow!  Seriously the look for reading to me was the same.  I really could not tell the difference and I am sooooooooo picky!  Then he showed that I could see writings in color also if there were pictures in the books I would see them.  Then with the other features of the Apps which I knew nothing about, but now have downloaded a bunch of free ones so far, and they work fine and are usefull or fun.  I especially wanted to read books.  I successfully downloaded my first book and Amazon has just bunches of free books to download and any book that you purchase and is enabled to loan you can loan that book one time to a friend!  I can hook up to Facebook and play my games or get my mail.  I read a lot so I don't play with it much for the others, but someday I will even download a movie and music!  It will hold a couple of thousand books and I think the 16 GB will hold close to 500 hours of movies.  I especially like when reading to use the black background with white print.  That setting is so easy on my eyes.  The Paperwhite does not have that feature.  The only thing I miss is not having the vocabulary builder where any word I look up is stored for me to work on learning better.  Maybe someday they will add that in an update.  For only $10 more than the Paperwhite I got this Fire. Such a Deal!  I never thought I would ever use one of these gadgets... I love paper books, but I really like being able to read in the dark and I can also make the print as large as I want and I now find myself pressing on words in paper books trying to get the dictionary meaning.. LOL.. having that feature is fantastic.  I read many hours a day, and I find I have to recharge about every 4 days.  Give it a try!

I found that my girlfriend was also using my kindle so frequently that I wished we had two of them. So I bought this.... all I can say is the Kindle Fire HD 7\" is our favorite of the two. The size is perfect for easy handling without the loss of the functionality of a big screen. We use it for reading, surfing the web, social media, and much more. The only time we use the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" instead of this one is when we choose to watch Amazon Instant Video in bed. The 8.9\" is a little bigger which makes watching videos easier, and its sound seems to be louder. If you are in the market for a tablet and you are considering Kindle, as well as considering cost, then this has to be your first choice. With the variety of apps out there you can both work and play on this bad boy. So far the must have apps I have gotten are: OfficeSuite Professional 7 ($4.99 but I used my amazon coins to purchase it), Adobe Reader, Kindle Free Books, Bitdefender Antivirus Free, and then your standard entertainment and social media apps. As far as physical protection goes, my girlfriend tends to be a bit clumsy so I opted for a more robust case than the standard leather case and got the i-Blason 2nd generation Armor Box. It's a great fit, still allows you to handle the kindle with ease, and gives you a good sense of security.All in all I am happy with both of my Kindles, but if I had to do it over again I think I would buy two of the 7\" and save myself the extra money because 85% of the time I preffer to use this one over the 8.9\"Just one additional comment, I strongly urge you to consider getting an Amazon Prime membership if you buy this, otherwise you will not fully utilize the benefits and capabilities of your Kindle. It's totally worth it if you read, stream movies, or buy stuff online. With the 2 day free shipping, kindle lending library, and free streaming it easily pays itself off.Hope this helps!", "Title": "AMAZING", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "P.

All the things I read about Kindle FreeTime made me sure that these were the perfect devices for our family - and boy was I disappointed.A bit of background: We are a family that is a big fan and avid users of the good, old-fashioned local public library. We typically bring back a haul of parent-approved books for my kids after a library trip.This year for Christmas we thought it would be nice to move our family into the 21st century and get e-readers for our 3 most avid readers. After reading about how you can check out books from the library for your Kindle, my biggest remaining concern as a parent was internet safety. I didn't want the price of an e-reader to be giving my kids unlimited Internet access - especially not access to browse the Kindle store, which is loaded with adult content. When I saw the videos about Kindle FreeTime, I was sold, and we bought 3 Kindles: 2 Paperwhites and an HD Fire.The Bottom line: I discovered that if you want to give your kids e-Readers, *without* giving them access to the Kindle store or the Internet - *and* you want to be able to check out e-Reader titles from your local public library, do *NOT* get a Kindle Fire - the Kindle Paperwhite is definitely the way to go.If you purchased a Kindle Fire HD for your child, here is the big disappointment: Kindle FreeTime does *not* work with library books. This leaves a parent with two options:  A) only have your child read books that you have *purchased* from Amazon, or  B) don't use FreeTimeEffectively, this makes Kindle FreeTime on the Kindle Fire require a monthly subscription fee as you must pay money *every* *time* your child wants to open a new book, and if your kids are avid readers (mine are) that monthly fee can be quite high.Our other option is to turn off Kindle FreeTime and let our kids browse all kinds of adult content on the Kindle store - but protecting the kids via FreeTime was the reason we purchased these devices in the first place.Parents beware: these devices are not for kids - unless you don't mind purchasing every book your child reads.The good news: The Kindle *Paperwhite* gives parents the option to completely block access to the Kindle Store without using Freetime. So if you want to use the library and block your kids access to the Internet and to the Kindle Store, the Kindle Paperwhite should serve your family's needs.", "Title": "Not for families, not for children :(", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R249O9KT1AZE54", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased one right after Thanksgiving on special.

I was extremely disappointed in both the selection offered for free there.  Most of the books offered there were older and available (also for free of course) via ebook using the Overdrive app in conjunction with my public library.

Instead I played with her on the main page but quickly realized Amazon makes that very dangerous as they can easily buy apps without even realizing it.Additionally this device makes it very easy to use Amazon content but not very easy to download music and movies from other sources.I returned the unit and have ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 for the same price as the Kindle with ads (the Samsung will not have ads, which will be a bonus).

When we asked who we could talk to about the fact that we had just paid for a brand new Kindle price for a refurbished unit, we were passed on to a woman who is the head of the Kindle returns department. She said that the warranty states that they can *at their choice* replace the unit with either a new or refurbished unit.

I'm an Apple enthusiast and have a 15\" MacBook Pro I am more than happy with for anything beyond what the iPhone will do. I was however looking at it for my daughter, who is currently 3.5 yrs old. She enjoys the few educational games I put on my iPhone for her, but without separate user profiles turning the restrictions on and off to ensure she didn't accidentally \"panic click\" something was getting tiring.  I had looked at the \"children's tablets\" such as the LeapPad and Nabi - but for the price I was thinking of paying for a dedicated children's tablet, I might as well be able to use it as well. Other tablets considered were the Nook HD, Nexus 7 and Galaxy Tab 3. One having an iffy future, one not having enough parental controls and the last being priced much higher than the 2013 Fire HD 7\" though always led me back to Amazon's Kindle.- Free Time  This was the single largest consideration for me; being able to set a separate user profile for myself and my daughter. The Kindle lets you not only set time limits if you so desire, you don't have to, but allows you to choose exactly the applications that your child is allowed to access and have more than one child profile for different ages/interests/time limits. And for older children you can just enable the Parental Controls from the drop down menu and restrict things like web access, videos or apps from the standard OS side of things.  Free Time Unlimited is available for a free trial and I strongly recommend everyone try it out before buying any apps for your children. There is a much larger selection of games and books available through Free Time Unlimited than there is on the standard app store. Parent beware however that it does NOT ask for a passcode or parental permission to start downloading all the games/books in the children's \"store.\" This is not so much a security issue as the store has little to no questionable material that I could find, but poses a storage problem. My daughter was very excited to see so many new things to try out that she promptly downloaded a rather large handful before I realized the implications. You can always go back and remove items from the device or supervise \"Kindle Time,\" but I'm just giving a heads up.- Hardware  As some of you may or may not know, the 2013 Fire HD 7\" does NOT have a camera, or a Mayday button or HDMI out (wireless or wired) and it is NOT the old Fire HD, it is really just an updated Fire \"standard/regular.\" Now that we have that out of the way -  a camera, Mayday button, HDMI, front facing camera, ect. were not really a concern for me. I have an iPhone for pictures (smaller, always with me) I have a computer for Skype and HDMI and by my understanding Mayday is not tech support, just customer service.  Now what it does have is an amazing screen. Side by side with the HDX in the store I could hardly tell a difference on the home screen, even less on reading and just a little on the sample movie. Some may be better at spotting this as I don't have a television and the laptop is pretty much my TV, but I felt the screen more than adequate for my requirements. Colors are clear and bright and edges are crisp.  The speed is plenty up to snuff as I don't have any prior tablets to compare it to. It does however seem faster than my mother's iPad 3. Apps download at at decent clip and loading times are minimal for those with just a little patience. The speakers sound great for such a small tablet, they completely put my iPhone's to shame and make watching movies on it rather enjoyable as your hands amplify the sound and give it more body (it seems, I'm not really an audiophile). I did opt for the 16GB version as there is no expandable memory and apps and books cannot be \"streamed\" from the cloud drive.- Software  One of the biggest complaints I have seen is the limited app store. Perhaps I'm being coy, but I don't need twelve different free calculator apps and seven paid versions. The app store has many things on it, such as every one of the games I had on my iPhone for my daughter, among several other nice utilities like banking, social media, Netflix and Twitch.tv.  The biggest complaint I have about the software is the lack of native Google support. No \"real\" YouTube or Google applications are available. That being said, the email app is no worse than Apple's for me and does support Gmail accounts and YouTube can be accessed from Silk - the Amazon native web browser. Silk is decently fast, while not Chrome fast it is acceptable and does display many websites in the desktop format rather than the mobile that some tablets default to, this was another thing I liked about the Kindle.  While I do prefer reading on an E-Ink reader, I can read comfortably on an LCD screen and the Fire is light enough to hold one handed with the bevel providing a nice surface to hold onto without touching the screen itself.  I do have the \"Special Offers\" on mine, however I do not find them obtrusive at all as Kindle screen turns off while locked you only see the ads for seconds before unlocking the device and you can always pay the extra $15 later if you truly don\u2019t want them.  The Kindle does come with a charger, however not the 9W \u201cPowerFast\u201d charger it does still charge at an acceptable rate. The plug does stick out at an angle from the device, but it is pointed up when the Kindle is laying on its back so I don\u2019t foresee any issues. Battery life is good, even when watching movies or playing games I get several hours from it (I don\u2019t have an exact time, I\u2019m sorry).  All in all a very nice device for the price. It\u2019s not a surface and it\u2019s not a power tablet with access to every app known to man, but it is a lightweight, inexpensive tablet that your child and you can enjoy.", "Title": "Jack of All Trades, Master of None", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Author": "Julie Graff", "ReviewID": "R2I8X22CWSEZ71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would have loved to have an iPad, but it just wasn't in the budget, so I purchased the first gen Fire.

I got it early and had a couple weeks to use it so I could see for myself the difference from the 1st generation Kindle Fire. I have to say that this is a great upgrade from that previous generation. I like the changes to the shape of the kindle with the contoured edges plus the audio and power button on each side on the back of the Kindle, both of which are easy to find with your fingers while viewing the main screen. Reading is fun and changing settings (i.e. text size, color of background, etc.), moving from page to page back and forth, navigating from chapter to chapter and making notes as I read was a breeze. I have a subscription to Golf Digest and reading the digital version on this tablet was great! Watching videos with this tablet was a great experience: I watched the James Bond film \"Skyfall,\" TV show videos via the hulu app and some Amazon plus videos on this Kindle. All videos were crisp and clear and I had no streaming problems over wi-fi. Audio from the built in speakers is surprisingly nice whether watching videos, listening to an audio book or music when propped up in the Origami Case in landscape (long side down) which is how I mainly used it. Setting up email on the Kindle and reading and replying to emails was easy and quick. I really like the fact that you can do all I just mentioned on this small tablet and take it with you wherever you go!

So the display was crisp and initially seemed to be fairly responsive with slight delay only in opening categories...then tried to download a book and it took forever...(no it was not my internet as the rude Amazon customer service guy tried to imply since my iPad Retina and Nook HD had no problems downloading the books)...I had to return when the back panel when the battery probably sits started getting really hot (like \"move your fingers or else\" kinda hot).The replacement faired better and got my books, movies and what not downloaded in a zip. The Silk browser is like any other cheap android tablet kinda browser - you know where the font is really small and the tabs really hard to touch.The real convenience is being able to get the movies I buy downloaded to take with me...Otherwise I actually prefer my Nook HD+ 9 inch ...better resolution and reading books is a joy....So with 70% battery life, I powered down the Kindle Fire only to pick it up 2 days later and it is dead..yup....", "Title": "When it works....", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R1P9VQF990P9QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As promised by Amazon, the Kindle Fire HD works as it ought to.My 11 yr old daughter is extremely pleased.

The sound is very nice for a 7 inch tablet. It is plenty fast for YouTube and streaming movies and videos. It is a little slow downloading all my hoarded emails.

It's quite good for both of these things and I would recommend it. The web browser is very good, quite fast and the image quality is great. For reading, it's awesome. I've watched some videos and found the sound and video quality to be good as well. Typing with the on-screenscreen keyboard is fairly easy too. However, there have been a couple of issues with it that I would mention. First, this is my second Kindle. The first one was junk in the box and would turn on, display a screen with multiple lines across it with text displaying backwards and then shut off again. Amazon replaced it with no hassle and sent a replacement via overnight shipping. The replacement Kindle works fine with the exception of intermittently shutting down. I haven't had this happen while reading, only while using the web browser. I researched this issue online and it seems to be a common problem, although not one I've found a solution to. I haven't contacted Amazon about the issue but plan to, as I've had my Kindle for just under a month and expect it to be free of issues of that kind. I also haven't been impressed with the battery life, but it's not awful. Overall, as an alternative to considerably more expensive devices with similar functionality, I do think this is a good value.

I am, however, writing to say order plenty of time in advance.  This item was sent good old Fedex smart post.  They didn't drop it off to fedex until the 3rd and it was promised delivery of the 4th (I ordered it the 2nd).  Fedex didn't get it to my local post office until after the cut off date, and now I will not be able to get it until tomorrow (the day I will be unavailable, and needed it for).  I will say that Amazon, as always, had awesome customer service and did all the could to try to arrange to get it to me, get another shipped out to be delivered today, to see if I could go pick it up at the post office it's currently being held at, etc.  I will never bash Amazon customer service as they always try their hardest to remedy the situation, and in my case extended my prime by a month as an \"apology gift,\" if you will for the inconvenience.  But, if you're going to be ordering this and need it for a specific date, order plenty of time in advance because once Fedex and the Post office start their tango...neither of them will take responsibility or help in correcting their problems.January 11, 2014 updateSo, I've had this item for about a month and a half.  The battery life crapped out over the past few days, before my kindle finally decided it wasn't going to turn on or accept a charge.  I've tried plugging it in to different outlets, as well as tried to charge via my computer with the supplied USB charger rather than plugging the USB charger into the wall plug that came with my kindle.  When it still didn't work I contact customer service and was blessed with someone who seemed to not have a grasp on the English language.  I explained to him my issues, and my trouble shooting of plugging it into different sources and it still not even showing me that it's charging, much less turning on.  The solution they had was to credit my account 20 bucks so I could order a new wall jack (when we've established the wall jack ins't the issue, it's either the cord or the kindle itself).  I repeated back to them that they wanted me to buy another wall jack when I'd confirmed the wall jack wasn't the issue, and I was told \"yes.\"  I ended the conversation because at 10 at night I am not going to play that game, and will try again tomorrow to get someone who can manage to understand the troubleshooting I've already done to try and rule out where problems may lie and will update once I hopefully have a reasonable solution to this.  But, it's not a good sign when a product doesn't hold a charge and doesn't power on just after 60 days, and the customer support team in place to handle it can't follow basic trouble shooting to remedy the situation quickly.  ...here's for hoping.January 14th, 2014...I'm returning both Kindle's.  I spoke with someone the 12th who said they'd send me a replacement.  They sent me a refurbished one.  Customer service tried to tell me the order was for a brand new one, I explained the sticker on the box flat out says \"refurbished,\" in a bunch of languages other than English.  At this point I'm returning both of the Kindle's.  The product was fun while I had it, and I enjoyed it.  I will say that much.

I took advantage of the FAA deal on November 4th, so I bought it at a lower discounted price brand new. The reason I chose the Kindle instead of another product was for reading purposes.  I also wanted an affordable tablet that I could search the web with without having to start up my laptop. I still enjoy having a laptop, by the way, and I'm not looking to replace it.  I gave this purchase a lot of thought. I had been leaning towards an ipad or a Samsung Galaxy.  But after looking around my house I felt that an ipad would be a purchase I didn't need. And although I loved the way the Galaxy looked, I felt that the product was apples to apples to the Kindle, with the galaxy costing a tad bit more than what I wanted to spend. I'm sure others would not agree. But honestly, they are both android applications so really how different could they be use wise? I already have an iphone and a laptop (and had recently gotten rid of a mini computer).  Nothing is wrong with any of these products, just to be clear.  I felt like they all were nice. I had to rationalize to myself and what I really wanted was a smaller device I could put in my purse or use around the house that was fast, affordable and easy. It was a challenge not to make it about the product itself, instead of what I would be using this product for, but I managed. We are always thinking of these items as investments. But really they are disposal items, in the long run, with the way technology is constantly evolving. Think about that first digital camera we all purchased years ago that we would never use now because the clarity is just not there. I know everyone raves about the ipad, and everyone seems to have one but I just couldn't justify the purchase. Many people I know have a Kindle and most of the people who have them love them. The amazon reviews are mixed. So it was a mixed bag of opinions. Since I'm a pretty easy person to please, I knew I'd enjoy this product. I also felt that there were probably many users that probably love this product, but haven't vocalized it and never will.  It depends on what you are using it for. My primary purpose is for reading, which is what the Kindles and Nooks specialize in so that's were I looked first. The reality is that if an electronic device breaks, I'm just going to turn around and buy another one so I don't want anything too expensive because products become outdated quickly and we are always looking for the next best thing. As soon as it's damaged, starts to run too slow or is outdated, I'm going to trade it in for a new model. That's just the reality. That would hurt if I bought a more expensive tablet that pretty much does the same thing...that made this purchase easy. Arrival time was sooner than anticipated, I received it five days later. I took it right out of the package and started using it that day.  I didn't even need to read the instructions to start it up, that's how easy its been.  Anyone who has used a smart phone or any kind of tablet at all will be able to pick one of these up and use it without instruction. So far it's been a great tablet.  I don't even mind the special offers page, I kind of like knowing what's out there. I put a password on my Kindle so that no one could accidently purchase anything. All and all I feel like I'll get some good use out of the product. The battery life has been great so far, it will last me all day and I use the Kindle for hours at a time. This model comes with a charger. Nothing but good things to say right now. I like the look and feel of it so far.

Are you looking for a tablet? This is the absolute worst tablet I have ever used. The interface is junk, the amazon \"store\" is horrible, it lags constantly, and the bezel is much too thick.

I was happy to see that Google Chrome worked, except on the kindle it only supports the older versions of Drive and Gmail. This would be okay on a desktop, but it makes it so much harder to work on with this thing. Also the battery life is rediculous.

Library books don't work in FreeTime.  Amazon Prime books and videos do not work in FreeTime. Netflix does not work in Freetime. The reason I purchased the Kindle was to encourage my children to read but the only books they can read are ones I must buy from Amazon (which I occasionally do but as you can imagine it can get VERY pricey).I contacted support and they said it was planned in the next release but having searched online I saw the same reports back in early 2012 so don't hold your breath.

If you are an experienced user and are looking to compare to other products like the ipad, other reviews will be more helpful.I bought the Fire 7 for my elderly mother.  I wanted to be able to give her a wide variety of books from kindle with the print enlarged to audible books to mp3s.  A nice bonus would be giving her mp3 music.  Boy, was this a mistake.I can buy and load everything I wanted but after two frustrating days I had to accept that there was no way I could make this easy for her to use.Like many 87 year olds she has limited vision and is very intimidated by technology.  The touch screen \"swipe\" technology may look cool, but it makes it much too easy to accidently go somewhere you don't want to go.  Contrary to what is stated in the users guide- the navigation bar (with the \"home\", \"back\" icons) does NOT show up on every page and Mom would panic if she ended up somewhere with no idea what to do.Other problems-1)  The frigging carousel.  It might be OK if the setting on the \"book\" page limiting books to what was \"only on this device\" also applied to the carousel but it doesn't.  So everytime I added a book to my kindle keyboard it showed up on the fire's carousel.  Since I buy frequently the carousel would be tedious and overwhelming for her.  Yes, there is a way to delete an item from the carousel but that is above her skill level.2)  The \"touch\" is unresponsive on the audible books.  I had to repeatedly tap the \"stop\" and half the time it didn't stop just ended up back at the home screen with the book still playing.  I'm sure it was \"user error\" but it shouldn't be that hard.3)  The \"app\" tool bar names, \"books\" \"music\" etc, are close together.  The screen is so sensitive that you need small steady fingers or you are going to end up someplace else.  Not a problem for most people, but a little old lady...4)  User manual is awful.  To begin, I don't like manuals you can't scroll through.  If you pick a topic you can't continue through the manual.  You have to go back to the main page and pick another topic.  You can try search but none of the words I entered showed up.  What is there is sometimes wrong (see above) and often inadequate.  For example, I thought kindle free time might make this usable for Mom but there isn't enough info.  It says kindle free time locks the pad into \"landscape\" but doesn't say if you can manually change it to portrait.  What does the home screen look like if you set free time?  Is there a way to get rid of free time if you don't like it?  Will the child (Mom) need to enter a password?  None of this is in the manual.Sigh.  So I gave up and gave Mom my beloved kindle keyboard.  It is absolutely perfect for her although I can only load it with kindle and audible books, no MP3.  Perfect for an elderly person (although the free 3G web browsing is probably too difficult for most) but they don't make it any more. So I can only hope that I can find a refurbished one if this one goes.Will use the fire myself.  How is the Fire for me?  So far, eh.  I don't need a mobile device very often and use kindle for reading and book buying.  Like my keyboard,the web access will be handy when I travel but not really an essential.  And the screen is glass and looks it.  Many, many smudges but they don't interfere with viewing.The screen rotating is a problem when lying on your side to read.  The kindle tilts a little and wheee, tilting words.  I'm pretty sure I can lock the screen in portrait- once I figure out how to undo everything I did to make it usable for Mom.Update 12-20-13:  24 hours later and feeling slightly less aggravated  :-) so wanted to add information on positive points (and one additional negative) that might be helpful:1) The screen is very well lit and resolution is excellent.2) Sound on the mp3 albums is surprisingly good for a device like this.3) Connecting with our home wifi was a piece of cake (just needed to know password).4) I found instructions on locking the screen to \"portrait\" (searched the help forum. Sweep down from the top of the home page screen and on the menu bar that appears tap the \"auto rotate\" button.  It will change to \"locked\")5) You can return within thirty days even if the box is open.  I may reset to factory defaults and do that.  The DX is still available though more expensive and I think they are phasing it out.  Since I don't want to deal with Christmas shipping crowds, I will wait until next week to decide.A negative point I forgot to mention was the battery.  I completely charged when I received.  The next day it received heavy use downloading books and music and the battery was drained by he end of the day.Fully charged the next day and then turned it on for about four hours with little use and left it on over night.  The battery is already 52% depleted.  I just turned off the wireless and hope that the battery will last a little longer.Five hours later the power had dropped to 30%.  At that rate it needs to be charged every day even with the wireless off.  Not great when travelling.

These are wonderful, sturdy tablets with very few limitations.Here are my gripes with this tablet:* No back facing camera (if you want that, you need to go up to the larger, more expensive version)* No SD card - I'm a big app downloader and podcast listener. However, there is the Amazon cloud and if you're careful what you download (use only ONE calendar app instead of having 5 loaded *LOL* or uninstall the apps you don't use much) you will be ok. The cloud keeps your books, music and unused apps. The problem I have is daily podcast downloads that are taking up space. I really LOVE BeyondPod on my kindle to handle podcasts but am going to have to drop those onto my mp3 player.With that said, those are my only beefs with this wonderful tablet.  Some folks may have a problem that you can't put google appstore apps on here, or use stuff like Google Maps or Voice. You CAN get your Gmail in the main mail application, and I just go to my computer for voice and maps. You can download 1MobileMarket if you need other apps that aren't in the Kindle store (just be careful and scan them with a tool like Lookout).Everything Amazon is wonderfully integrated - the music, Prime videos and movies, magazine subscriptions you can purchase, and books. You get a free app of the day. My favorite first thing to do each morning is to check today's free app.There are tons of free books (just Google \"free kindle books\" and peruse all the lists you want!) as well as your purchased Amazon books that are digital. The Music cloud player is great - I'm finding pretty much all the obscure music I want on Amazon, purchase the digital version, and don't have to worry about losing the CD or losing the digital copy on a crashed hard drive - it's all in the cloud and plays great on the tablet.The high definition screen and dolby sound is so great for games and movies. But it's also an excellent reader. It handles books and media extremely well. One thing I do wish though is for a better organizational shelf. All your books are in alphabetical order or by most recent (same with apps). I'm old. I forget the name of all these apps. Amazon would do well to allow us to create organizational folders or shelves to organize our apps and books. It would be so easy to find all my business books if I could just throw them into a Business shelf, and my cookbooks on a Cookbook shelf. Right now they're really impossible. It's the same with the Cloud. They just are a whole list of books, and if you get over a certain amount, good luck finding the book you want.Make sure you purchase the quick charger with your Kindle. Plugging in the cable to USB on the computer and charging it is ugly. It's slow, and it's just not intuitive or nice. It needs plugged into the wall, and the charger you can buy separately will charge it very quickly. Please make sure you plug the charger into a wall surge protector. I fried my wall charger and we thought it was the kindle because it wasn't charging. It ended up being the charger because it was plugged in directly to the wall, and I was told they are very sensitive. I bought the Belkin 6-outlet wall mount surge protector for this purpose: B004CLYJ0UThere are many great cases for the HD7. The silicon cases are great, inexpensive, help you get a grip on the tablet, and offer some protection. Cover cases offer protection during travel. This 7\" is a great size for travel in a bag.This Kindle is easy to learn, easy to see, and easy to use.

It's not unreasonable to expect to be able to sideload content you want your kids to be able to access, but the FreeTime environment doesn't recognize any books loaded via cable or pulled from Dropbox. I've spent all day trying to find a workaround that will allow my daughter to access the content I've collected for her. (Please note that what you send to your account gets filed as a Personal Document and doesn't seem to show up as a book and is not accessible in FreeTime.) There was a time-consuming workaround involving converting books to epub, then uploading to a third-party app available via Amazon, but the 2013 version of this doesn't seem to work in the same way. And even if it did work, it would be impossible to give her extended (or unlimited) reading time because that really means unlimited apps (Angry Birds) time. Speaking of the time limits, anyone who hoped for a bedtime shut-down will be disappointed. Time limits seem to only be so many hours and minutes per activity, with not option for: you may only read until 9:30pm.The device is attractive, comfortable, blah blah, you've heard. I bought an Amazon device because I DO want to shop Amazon. But it's hard not to see these problems as something created to force Absolute Exclusivity, and that's really harshing my Christmas spirit.ETA: Pre-installed email and calendar apps cannot be shared in FreeTime. My daughter is allowed to use her email and I wanted her to use the tablet to start keeping herself organized, so a calendar...

For the second generation I actually noticed it was quite buggy. I could have just been mine but I noticed quite a few more problems than my original Kindle. A few things i've noticed, this thing kind of has a mind of it's own sometimes...For example, every time I try to open the app store, for some reason it takes me back to the Carousel and it seems to do this every time. When i'm typing on a website or writing reviews it also goes back to the Carousel and I lose EVERYTHING I previously wrote which can be very frustrating. I've also noticed when using the web browser (Silk)  it's hard to view pictures. When you try to zoom in it will only zoom in on certain areas (that's just if you click on an image to make it larger though) Most apps run pretty well, and if there are issues it's usually just the app itself but the Kindle it's self hasn't caused any problems (so far). I've had a lot of issues trying to view videos though, even the simplest format (such as Youtube videos). Sometimes it will say it requires a certain plug-in but other times it says nothing of the sort even though I haven't download  a plug-in.

Well, I'd like to just first say that I have never owned a tablet of any kind and only bought this one after hearing to many \"old dinosaur\" remarks about me hauling around a laptop. OK! First off, I back ordered this and it arrived in good condition and on schedule. However, there is no operations manual but does have a little introduction program that kinda assists you on the operation... problem is... it leaves alot to the imagination. I have NEVER bought anything that didn't have an instruction manual with detailed info on the operation of said device. So I had a pretty big learning curve and am still trying to figure it all out.. but this is what I know so far...The screen is pretty impressive and does operate fairly quickly. YES, it does allow access to youtube, but it does not operate very well at all....it Buffers constantly...so no youtube really unless you like seeing that little buffer circle thing every 30 secs or so....(not for this ol' boy.) I was, however, able to get on the internet without much trouble and visited the general stuff that most people do....(eg. facebook (kinda slow to load though), google, and a few others without incident).Now for the things that most people are complaining about... no camera, no HDMI. No. this kindle doesn't have those on this model...if you had read the description of what you were buying this would not have been a suprise. I do now wish I'd bought one that had a camera to use with skype but oh well right?I honestly can't complain enough about not having a step-by-step instruction program or manual...it makes it hard for us die-hard laptop owners to adjust to this new(ish) tech. So if I had to complain at all, it'd be that it needs to be more User-Friendly to those who are not currently up-to-date with current tech. I am not aware of how \"APPS\" work... I'm more familiar with actual software and programs... I'm still a bit confused as to the operations of an APP and what exsactly it is. Also, how in the world do you download a video from amazon? I know i have to pay for it... but where does it go? I understand very little about the \"CLOUD\" thing and I suppose the purchased movie CAN BE saved on the devise itself...but how does all this work? What do I click? where does my movie go? can I access it online or offline? Same for music... can I sync it to my MP3 player? If the docs/media/movies are saved on the devise itself, where are they? Why can't I create a file so I know how to access them? And speaking of files, how to I create a file so I can save information I've found on the internet for future reveiw... also, HOW DO YOU SAVE INFO FROM THE INTERNET? where do the books I purchase go? device or \"Cloud\"....Ok... I know it sounds like I'm giving this thing a bad rap...but I'm not. I am just not yet comfortable with it and have absolutely no idea of it's operations and what I can and cannot do. So far, it's cool for social media, internet searches, I ASSUME works well with NetFlix (which I have but haven't checked it out just yet.) But I do have to say this...the device is cool if you want the newest peice of tech out there and it definatly has some cool features (as far as I know)... but unfortunantly, it cannot compare to the cheapest laptop on the market today. A cheap ACCER (or however it's spelled) can do much more than this device and cost about the same. A laptop, in my mind/experince, cannot be replaced by any form of tech out there. The ACCER I'm talking about only weighs a little more and a little bigger in size. NO I hate ACCER laptops and think they are cheap... but they, I think would be a better option...it's small, light weight, has every possible program and software, every connection, wireless, KEYBOARD, HDMI/extended monitor capabilities, and will do just about everything possible with the exception of the downloading of books and movies (which you can purchase the real one and save in computer.)Either way, laptop of Kindle, get what suites your needs... I may find later that this little thing can be really cool...but I like having more options and first-time user references to assist in initial operations for those not obsessed with every possible current/new tech to impress everyone with...PS: where is the compatible cases for this thing so I can protect it from shattering with the slightest bump??", "Title": "Curious about operations....", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nobel", "ReviewID": "R5J9YCK7IFG3K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've purchased a Kindle Fire HD and before 3 months of light use the speakers stopped working.

Based on the ads and reviews of the Kindle Fire HD, we thought it would be an ideal gift for her sixth birthday, since we could control what she could access using Kindle FreeTime.  Herein is where the problem lies.First, FreeTIme allows access to apps, books, and videos, but not to music (?)  To get around this, we needed to download a third-party music player app into FreeTime, but the app was buggy. In addition to being unstable, it did not show album artwork, which would've made it impossible for a kid in the beginning stages of reading to find what they were looking for (this issue was true for 3 different music apps we tried).The second big issue we ran into was movies.  As Apple users, our entire library of digital movies is on iTunes, which uses a format for movies incompatible with Kindle.  So aside from investing in a format conversion program and converting them all over to a Kindle acceptable format, our iTunes movies were useless.Lastly, and this is less a criticism of Kindle than it is of Netflix, is the lack of \"Netflix for Kids\" as part of the Netflix app.  As stated previously, our daughter was familiar with the iPad version of Netflix in which she could choose the Netflix for Kids option when she opened the app. She understood it as \"her\" Netflix. The Netflix app on Android/Kindle has no such option and, as such, if my daughter used it in FreeTime, she faced the option of wading through shows that we had previously watched, such as Breaking Bad, to find a cartoon.I wrote this review to help other parents who may be contemplating buying this device for the same reasons I did to let them know of these major faults.  I have no doubt the Kindle Fire HD is a wonderful tablet that offers great value outside of the situation I described here.  As far as being ready-made for the kiddos, it's a work in progress.

Maybe that's not a kindle glitch, but this is the FIRST TIME I EVER had any trouble with Audible, as I usually download on my Razr Maxx immediately. An added note (that turns my stomach), I got about halfway through Amazon's feedback survey regarding my purchase, and it's was just glowing, back-patting leading questions to choose from, with few 'none of the above' options offered.

Passed it down to daughter and bought this one.Disadvantages to me:1. I still have not gotten use to outside volume buttons. I prefer to access volume on touch screen. I understand why some would want an external volume access, but I don't like the buttons. I touch them when I am reading. Actually, I HATE the external volume button.2. The only way you can hold the kindle without continually touching the on/off button and volume buttons, is to hold it sideways. This really irks me. I should not be forced to have to buy a cover just to use this kindle. I don't even know if a cover would prevent me from touching the on/off button volume buttons. I will be reading on the kindle and shift my hands for comfort, when suddenly the prompt comes up asking if I want to power down my kindle...because I have accidentally touched the on/off button. Or the volume prompt comes up. I don't want to continually lock or unlock the screen because usually I am getting text messages; so overall, I absolutely do not like the placement of these external buttons. They should have left the button where it was and get rid of volume buttons.3. I dislike the special offers. When I save to buy another new kindle, I will not buy \"include special offers\". I will pay more for excluding special offers.Advantages:1. I love reading on my Kindles. This newer HD has even better brightness control and choices for reading in dark room.

I found out that while they are 3 SEPARATE DEVICES that they all use the SAME CLOUD/MEMORY space and that the only way to remedy was to make 3 separate email addresses for each person. So, I did that and had a TON of trouble RE-PURCHASING the two games I had bought for each kids KINDLES. So I got to pay for them 3 TIMES. The Kindles all like to shut off at random or fail to upload an app (from the AppStore). We constantly have to hold down the reset button for 20 seconds all the time. Next, my charger won't charge (again these are less than 6 months old) and my son's cord is frayed. I spoke to Customer Service and it was determined the cord to mine was not working. So, they credited my account for a new USB cord- or so they said. I went to my cart to order the cord and no IT'S THE ADAPTER IN THERE -NO USB CORD. I called back AGAIN.

I read several reviews and saw lots of stars for the Fire HD, so I purchased this (new) from a Best Buy eagerly. I was hoping for a more responsive touch screen, smoother highlighting, better annotation and scrolling through PDFs, and reading in the dark.I was in for a rude awakening.I'll be reviewing the device as an e-reader and a budget tablet computer separately.----ReaderMy first major disappointment was when I learned that the Kindle Fire does not support Collections - a feature which I use extensively. On the Fire, I just have a mass of books that I cannot really organize. Instead the user only has the dubious privilege of a carousel that throws all applications in with all books read. The carousel is a nuisance that can be neither disabled nor easily managed. It is not a substitute for the much cleaner collections available to true Kindle readers and computer apps.My next frustration was the way the Fire's reader manages highlighting across \"screens\" of a book. In point of fact, you can't. This is a major hassle, as highlighting to the bottom of one screen, flipping the page, and continuing the highlight constitutes two separate annotations when synched to your Kindle account and other Kindle apps.On that note, navigating by locations is a terrible, terrible UI decision (not endemic to the Fire), but it could at least be ameliorated by displaying the range (e.g., locations 1000-110) at the bottom of the page to facilitate smoother navigation. Or why not allow for continuous scrolling on screen, since locations are themselves a concept that's supposed embody the \"seamlessness\" of digital text? Hint: they don't.Finally, the on-board PDF viewer is extremely spartan. It's sluggish in loading pages and you can't even highlight or take notes with it.In these fashions the device fails to impress as a reader. End-user engagement with content is clunky for books, and nonexistent for PDFs. This isn't a Kindle e-reader with more features - it's a Fire, a separate species of device, and the consumer would be wise to treat it as such.---TabletAs a cheap tablet, the Fire fares rather poorly. The name \"Fire\" is ironically appropriate - moderate use makes this baby heat up like a pancake. It gets warm, and quickly, if the processor has to do any measure of work (rendering graphics in games, or streaming video on Netflix make it toasty).The battery life on this device is a further disappointment. The chief culprit? Clicking the power button doesn't actually sleep the device - it just turns off the screen. In fact, the device CANNOT sleep: it's either on, or it's off. So the WiFi is constantly scanning for connections, radically depleting the battery, wherever you go with this stowed. (By chance I happened to learn that HOLDING the power button for five seconds will turn the device off, but bootup takes around two minutes and I've just resigned myself to leaving the device \"always on.\")The touch screen is marginal at best. While it displays images well, response frequently lags. Swiping on the keyboard is imprecise. And good luck getting the menu button to appear when you want it: you have to touch the bottom of the screen very specifically for the Fire to register this as the request to bring up this essential function. In point of fact, it seems like the Fire DOESN'T want you adjusting things - just taking them in placidly.Not that Amazon wants you to tinker with the device. This is a machine designed to encourage you to buy. The Fire OS is a custom Google Android environment designed to facilitate quick and easy purchasing of content from Amazon. The carousel (which I touched upon previously) does not allow for organizing or arranging (although if you poke around enough, you might discover you can \"pin\" programs at the very bottom of the home screen). Whatever you used last appears on the far left of the carousel. Swiping across apps brings up recommended purchases (couched as \"Customers who used X also bought the following\").The store itself is a nightmare; the default category of New and Popular, for example, throws apps with 4,800,000 and 20 downloads into the same pot. Everything is cross-listed. This environment is a mess. And it's not even a cutting-edge mess! Amazon has to vet apps independently of Google, so the trickle-down process is slow. Expect a months-long delay before finding applications that have been around for months on Google Play or iOS.THERE IS NOTHING FOR THE KINDLE FIRE YOU CAN'T GET ON AN ANDROID TABLET SOONER, CHEAPER, AND BETTER. Everything this device does, other devices do - with better battery lives, similar price points, and far far more end-user nuance to boot.If you are scared of technology but still want its desserts, this will hold your hand through the whole process tolerably well.

One of the tablets had a problem with the memory (said I didn't have sufficient storage to download a movie).  I called the help line and the rep patiently, kindly, and efficiently walked me through a reboot which fixed the problem.  This tablet is exactly what I wanted - a handy-sized entertaiment/reader/web access.  I have a laptop to do \"computer\" tasks.

With a ton of time spent using this device I have felt comfortable enough to actually review it, but the process in how I do it actually stumped me. See the Kindle Fire HD is in a class all by itself; what do I describe it as? Calling it a tablet seems to dispute the original intentions of the Kindle name, but it does everything that a normal tablet would do. I think I finally figured out how to do this review, so here is how it will break down; I will review EACH and every single thing about it, including how it plays games, music, movies and then I will throw in a few apps to show if it is good or bad. So with that said, the one I received is the very awesome price tag of $139.00, and is the 8GB version of the Kindle Fire HD 7\u201d. Now let\u2019s get into the bread and butter of the Kindle Fire HD.Overall the Kindle Fire HD is a pretty solid gaming device, but it could use some improvements to the store. Other than that, I would happily play more games on it, as it is a good gaming device with a decent selection of quality games.I want you to sit back and think about this process carefully, as having a Kindle Fire HD will not set you back as other devices, and performs all the same as those that cost $400-500. I urge you to remember though, while the selection may be lackluster at this moment in time, get one for what it will become. I really do think that the Kindle Fire HD has set a bar of standards in terms of performance for me, and at a mere $139 it is a steal.", "Title": "Kindle Fire HD is a good device!", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "hammer", "ReviewID": "R20DUQ3226B70L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd love it if i could get a proper HDMI cable to connect to my television.

I enjoy playing games on my Fire, and my app storage on the first generation wasn't enough.  The HD has all storage space in one pot, unlike the first generation which had the storage divided.

Maybe there is a connection. But then after three or four hours of steady reading, I am ready for a break--maybe the Kindle is as well. The upside is that the HD recharges very quickly.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  This may be influenced by the fact that it's my very first tablet but nonetheless, I don't think I could be happier.  My main purpose for purchasing it is for reading ebooks.  I was using my large Android - which worked well - but between my music cateogory, all my apps and my books, the storage on my phone was shrinking; I was getting worried about losing content (even though I store in multiple locations, including cloud storage, I always seem to lose SOMETHING when technology finally dies).  So I bit the bullet and bought a Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I have been very impressed by Amazon across the board so I figured I'd stick with their brand - if I had a problem, I knew they'd support me on it.  In addition, the price was amazing ($139) and combined with the special deals they're offering, I thought I'd finally buckle and join the tablet world.I know other reviewers have said this one falls short of previous models and/or previous generations but, again, this being my very first tablet, I love it.  It's really simple to use (especially for a first timer), I LOVE the sound when I have it docked to my stereo (for some reason, it sounds evey better than my \"Beats\" Droid) and I find myself carrying it around everywhere I go!

Even though the seller said that there were minor ware on the item, I didn't care, since this was going to a 1-year-old. For the price of $64 plus tax it's a lot better than $129 new. A child's tablet is pretty limited and isn't as good as the Amazon Kindle. The Kindle arrived the day after her birthday, which is today. When my daughter saw her Kindle, she smiled big and was ready to play her educational Apps.The seller said that the Kindle had some imperfections from ware, but I didn't see any. The Kindle looked brand new than used. I have never seen used items look brand new. I am pleased with this Kindle Fire.

That considered, the 7\" Kindle Fire HD exceeds any expectations I had and the result is one happy Kindle owner!Meant to replace a decrepit couch side laptop, my Kindle is a stay-at-home device with the purpose of having quick access to sports scores, social media applications, and internet access. To each of these, the Kindle Fire does extremely well and performs with a level of efficiency that I was lacking from the expensive and aging Dell.Installing and managing apps is super simple and accessing them in quick fashion is overtly satisfying. The layout is very streamlined and, most importantly, it makes sense! With a Kindle, there is no need to search aimlessly for what you need - instead, everything resides where it logically belongs and navigating the menus is a breeze.The picture quality is - as you would expect from an HD device - fantastic; the sound is darn good for the size of the speakers; and, the device's response to the touchscreen inputs is spot on.At this level of affordability, it is simply amazing what the Kindle Fire does. For a very long time, this will be my go-to device when sitting at a PC just isn't ideal.

I had almost decided on an IPad when I read about FreeTime Unlimited for kids offered on the KIndle Fire. I knew then what I wanted to buy. I could not be more pleased with this great tablet and the content available on Freetime Unlimited is amazing amassing hundreds of books, videos and apps. I downloaded a bunch of kid's books to my 5 year old son's account and we were flipping through the home page that shows all of his books and he looked at me and said \"A library Mama!\". That is exactly what I was hoping for. I know he will love the videos and games but more than anything I want him to have a love of reading and this tablet will help me accomplish that with an incredible library of books at his fingertips. The Kindle Fire HD feels nice and sturdy and well more expensive than it's price. As I move throughout the tablet the pages flow like melted butter, beautifully responsive. I am a long time owner of the original Kindle ereader and I really would not have expected anything less from a Kindle. I am a huge fan. The 7\" size of this tablet is great for travel and easy for my son to hold. I expect that it will become my son's KIndle and I will be purchasing another for myself for Christmas.
