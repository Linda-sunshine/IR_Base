{"Reviews": [{"Author": "rabil", "ReviewID": "R1SC0B5UB1J782", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All the portable HDTVs have low resolution screens. This tablet works well as a portable HDTV (also can receive mobile DTV where available). The resolution is about 4 times higher than simple portable HDTVs. Plus it's an Android tablet so you can browse the web, hear Internet radio, get e-mail, write latex documents, ssh to your server, purchase Amazon products, etc. The tablet is well made and while not the thinnest or most powerful tablet available, it's well worth the $200. Also, the battery lasts a long time. Most portable HDTVs have batteries that last at most about an hour. The table lasts a good two hours when viewing HDTV. It has a built-in antenna and an external antenna port (female SMA). Also has HDMI output so you can connect it to your larger HDTV or pc monitor. It does not have bluetooth but you can get a bluetooth adapter that plugs into the headphones jack.", "Title": "Best Portable HDTV Available", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.00", "ProductID": "B00D6KFYTI", "Features": "Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, 8 inches Display\nA5 1 GHz\n8 GB Flash Memory, 0.5 GB RAM Memory\n4-hour battery life, 1.42 pounds", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z6JbesZ%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "Name": "RCA MobileTV DMT580DU 8-Inch 8GB Tablet"}}
