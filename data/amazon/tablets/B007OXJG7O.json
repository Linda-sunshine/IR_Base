I reset to factory setting after problems with internet connectivity. I have a netgear router which serves my one laptop without problems.I connected the wi-fi or what the tablet indicated but could not access any internet sites, apps, google, etc.I called the help number and after walking me though another factory reset the same problem existed. No connectivity even though the tabled indicated it was connected. The help rep told me it is probably the router and I should call netgear. This was not what I expected but called netgear and the rep told me there is nothing wrong with the router. So frustrated, I told the person who gave this to me as a gift to send it back.Also, documentation is poor!", "Title": "Wi-fi problem", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Metal Gimp \"MetalGimp\"", "ReviewID": "R25H9SVQF7NEOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Polaroid S7 Android tablet was very attractive at $90 from Kohls, so I bought two. That was a bit foolish.First off, I liked the fact that it would charge through the USB, unlike the AGPtek AGPtek 7 inch Android 4.0 Capacitive Touch Screen Tablet PC (Wi-Fi G-sensor, 800*480, 1GHz, 512MB DDR3, 8GB built-in Capacity with Expandable Micro SD Card Slot, Front Camera, Support 3G 3D 1080P HD Flash 11.1 & Multi-language), my first Android tablet. Similarly, the LCD looks nice, and felt good in the hands. At least, however, the AGPtek worked._BAD_TOUCHSCREEN_The first thing I noticed was that it seemed to have problems with touch. I thought it was the protective sheet over the face. Not so. It worked inconsistently even after removal (bad idea, see below). This was particularly noticeable and irritating when using the virtual keyboard; rotating the device around so that it flipped helped, but imagine trying to text while rotating it... hardly considered useful. I wanted to determine the cause, and being that I work with alpha touchscreen hardware, I believed that there were \"dead zones\" in the digitizer. There were, but not in a way I expected.I wrote a simple app that marked the places where I tapped the screen. Tapping left a pattern that indicated a flawed touchscreen design. _The digitizer blocks out the screen in near 1cm grid_ from edge to edge! This means that many of the keys on the virtual keyboard cannot be clicked. After tapping (I tested both devices), there was a clear, *wide* grid. I verified the app on my Android cellphone and found no problem.All in all, that was a significant showstopper for Android which relies on a good touchscreen. (It's a pity I can't post screen snapshots of what I discovered. They are surprising. Can anyone think of a way...?)_NO_GOOGLE_STORE_The device lacks Google Store App. Their website states that they're not certified and that:\"Our tablets are not licenced with GooglePlay store as of yet. However, we find that the Google Android market caters mainly to smart phones. Polaroid Tablet users can download apps by downloading the Amazon App Store application or by loading .apk files directly onto the device using the preloaded 'Apk Installer' or 'Download Manager' (depending on your model number) which will be located in your tablet's app menu. Polaroid Tablets are pre-installed with a homescreen widget titled 'Download App Stores'.  From here you can download a variety of App Stores which you can download apps from.\"What chutzpah! All the great apps found on Google Play are, according to this citation, \"cater[ed] mainly to smart phones.\" Hmmm... sounds like they're not committed to getting licensed.There are many videos on how to install the Google Play Store, but all of the ones I found require access through the developer's debug interface. All the drivers I tried failed to be recognized by Eclipse and ADB. I sent several emails to their support, and their only response to date has been \"Tell us why.\"Bottom line: all the apps I bought on play.google.com are unavailable /and/ unlikely to be available any time soon._WEAK_GLASS_Simply, it took little time to get the glass scratched. I never had that problem before with other touch screens; so, if you intend to keep it, I recommend *not* removing the protective sheet._FLAKY_DEVICE_One of the tablets began to \"flake out.\" We're trying to resurrect it now.<<<UPDATE>>>_DANGEROUS RECHARGE_When recharging, the device turns itself back on! This means that the device will be running and if you're in your car (like we were driving back from a long trip), the device will overheat! It got hot enough that touching it was painful.", "Title": "Don't buy: bad touchscreen technology", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R3FUMX01FZJJXW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I initially bought this tablet because of the great value and being able to use that store's coupons on top of the purchase value.  I felt since it was so cheap it would be worth my wild to take advantage of finally being to test drive an android tablet.  I've come to believe that I did well!  Polaroid has always been a great name when it comes to picture quality so I chose this over other featured android tablets that were low in cost.  It turns out that I made a great choice!  The colors are great, the ease of use from the start was excellent! No dropped WIFI reception if you have a good carrier! I ended up buying the Polaroid 8 inch and an additional 7 inch (in case I don't want to carry my 8 inch around with me). We never owned any touchpads and I have to say that now I'm hooked!  The instructions are well written and also have a picture for each instruction step.  Kids can follow the instructions easily (they're much more technically and electronically suave then adults these days!). When needed double tap the screen to enlarge pictures and words.  Sometimes that helps when you can't seem to zero in on tapping with your finger or buy a stylus.  Make sure you also purchase a stand to hold the touchpad upright as apposed to constantly holding it with your hand.

First off, I was worried because the shipping said within 10 days (even though I paid for the 4-6) but it came within 2.  Not bad.  Next, I had to set it up before he could use it.  The preinstalled buttons to get it online and the Amazon app store were easy to use.  Started downloading some educational free apps (there are a ton) and of course, Angry Birds.  There was a bit of a problem with the signal strength on his, but they all downloaded.  I bought one for myself after another search to find one in store (which I did), and it had better signal reception than his, but couldn't play Angry Birds.  Strange that it's compatable with one, but not the other.  I did check, and they are the same item numbers and running the same OS.

A week and a half after i bought it, the power button \"unwelded\" itself from the computer board, and fell inside the casing.  Couldnt use the tablet without having a way to turn it on!  So I took it back to exchange it for another one, because I thought maybe just this one was bad.  I opened up the second one, and the charge port is inoperable!  It does not charge, even when plugged in for several days!I took back the one I was planning on gifting, as I am NOT about to have someone else use a product that Ive had such crappy luck with!
