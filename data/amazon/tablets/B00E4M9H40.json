Screen is not bad for the price, however, I experienced great difficulty trying to make the touch screen respond.  It was also very slow to load sites even if you were close to the wifi source. At first I loved it but as I began to try to use it more, it became aggravating to me and made me want to buy something more costly but dependable. You get what you pay for. Not bad for the price if you are really really patient.", "Title": "Unreponsive and slow to load", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "new mom", "ReviewID": "R2NDT4YY6ADIH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It arrived fast! didn't realized it was coming from overseas.
