{"Reviews": [{"Author": "D. Lee \"Fire Horse\"", "ReviewID": "R1RZP2DIWZ8HXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I was doing all of my research on tablets, trying to understand what the options were and what made tablets slightly different from one another, it bugged me how no one would state the obvious in their reviews. So, I'm going to start with some really obvious features of this tablet, in order to help people who may be newer to the \"tablet\" world.YES, you CAN stream Netflix from this tablet, so long as you first go to Netflix, on the normal Internet, and sign up for an account. Then, once you start up your tablet, you can go to the app store and download the Netflix app for FREE. The first time you access Netflix thru the tablet, you'll sign in using your regular Netflix account, and from that point forward, you'll use your Netflix account through the app. You'll have a Netflix \"tile\" on your tablet, and you'll just \"tap\" it, and your personal Netflix account will come up, including your queue, etc. You'll tap the tile for the movie you want to stream, and it'll fire right up and stream.YES, you CAN read books through Kindle on this tablet. You don't need to buy any kind of separate Kindle functionality. Your tablet, in essence, becomes a Kindle. Through the Kindle app, you will be able to log onto your regular Amazon account and download/buy books offered in Kindle format. As with Netflix, you will have a Kindle tile that you can just tap. All of your Kindle library will appear. Just tap the book you want to read, and start reading. The great thing is that you turn the page simply by tapping the screen. You can navigate inside the book, etc. The Kindle function on this tablet it GREAT.YES, there is an electronic keyboard on this tablet. You do NOT need to buy an external keyboard. In fact, the internal keyboard gives you a few different \"configuration\" options.Now, to the general review, and first the good things: This tablet is lightweight and sleek. It has a good camera, and the graphic interface is fabulous. The colorful tiles are rich looking, and movies and old TV shows stream crystal clear. Because the tablet runs on straight Windows 8, a wide array of apps is available. Despite what you may read elsewhere, Windows 8 is embarrassingly EASY to use. I don't understand why people complain about it. You simply touch what you need, and it comes up. It's BETTER than earlier versions of Windows.Back to the tablet, more generally, you can set up your system to have access to more than one e-mail account. I access both my Yahoo and my Gmail accounts. The battery lasts quite a long time. I'm able to charge the tablet at night and use it all day the next day (although it is asleep while I work). I regularly stream Netflix at lunch, and the battery holds out. Also, the \"low battery\" warning comes early. You have plenty of time to find your power supply and plug in the tablet. The news sources are great, and the entire \"news\" tile provides one-stop shopping. And, in general, you can drag the tiles into any configuration on the tablet. There is no \"hard coded\" tile layout that you're stuck with. The tiles are active, which means they \"flip\" or \"roll over\" as they display new information. The free twitter app includes a live tile that will update you with info from your twitter account.The best thing is the fact that the Microsoft programs are on the tablet. I really need easy access to Word for what I do. It's fabulous to be able to switch from fun, games, movies, news, and all the other tiles with the swipe of a finger and pull up Word. The added bonus is that if you're stuck somewhere where there's no Wi-Fi (or you don't have the password to a Wi-Fi network), you can still use your tablet to get \"Word\" stuff done (or Excel, Publisher, etc.). Your tablet can still entertain you (or let you get work done). The Kindle works too without the Internet. You just can't use the dictionary function in the Kindle if the tablet is not connected to the 'Net. But you can read your books.So, why not five stars? Well, a few reasons. (1) When you first unwrap the tablet and plug it in, because it is completely dead, it takes a LONG time to even turn on. You'll keep hitting the \"on\" button, to no avail. I literally thought mine was defective. After 10+ minutes of panic, it finally turned on and booted up. I thought it had maybe been a glitch until (2) I let the battery run down for the first time after owning it for a few days. When I plugged in the tablet on the day I let the battery drain all the way to empty, I had the same (scary) wait for it to actually turn on and boot up. Once it is charged a bit, you have to hold down the button for a specific amount of time to get the tablet to start, and, again, it will NOT turn on until it has been charging for several minutes. Since NO other device on the planet fails to function the SECOND it is plugged in, it is scary when you plug in the dead tablet and get no response for several minutes. Worse is the fact that nothing in the instructions or guide indicated that it would take the tablet several minutes to get charged enough to respond to being plugged in and to actually turn ON. Also, the power cord is SHORT. Buy an extension cord right away. The power cord provided by the manufacturer is a joke, length-wise. (3) Despite how great movies on Netflix look, ironically, the one app that will (too often) freeze your system and force a reboot is Netflix. I can't tell you how many times I hit the back button on Netflix to go back to my list of movies I want to stream, just to have the screen go chromy black. At that point, the entire tablet is frozen. I have to reboot (and with my fears about how long it may take for the button to respond to my reboot attempts), it's annoying that this app malfunctions in this way. Ninety-five percent of the time, Netflix runs fine. But...a five-percent freeze rate is lame. (4) As other reviews may have mentioned, for no reason at all, the tablet loses/drops its connection to the Internet/Wi-Fi. Even if it the connection is strong and it shows \"connected,\" you still are not connected. So, you have to quickly disconnect and reconnect. It takes no more than 22 seconds, but it's a pain. It interferes with apps and videos you're running. (5) The speaker is pretty weak. It mostly doesn't matter, but if you're streaming something weak (like an old TV show or a YouTube video with weak sound), it's a tad annoying. MOSTLY, the speaker is fine, but it could be better.In sum, this tablet is fast, sleek, light, entertaining, multifunctional, and way ahead of the iPad curve with the Microsoft programs. It's begging to be five-star. However, because it takes long to start if the battery has fully drained, freezes during Netflix, drops its Internet connection, has a very average/too-weak speaker, a short power cord, and a useless user's guide, it gets bumped down to four stars. In NO way is it three-star.This is a solid four-star tablet that has been a great joy to own since I bought it, and for the price, you can't beat it. I would buy it again and definitely recommend it. The minor irritations are not that big a deal. Windows 8 is awesome, the tablet is light enough to carry everywhere, and the price is right.11/30/13 Update: I still love this tablet. I'd even upgrade it to 4.5 stars. (1) I no longer leave it asleep at work and literally stream my favorite radio station all day AND watch Netflix at lunch, and the battery doesn't drain, so long as I leave for work with it fully charged. (2) Netflix or Microsoft must have heard a lot of feedback because, overall, Netflix performs a bit better now than it used to. (3) I use the SkyDrive to save things, and it works great. Videos too large for e-mailing can be sent to the SkyDrive and shared from there, including e-mailing them to a person. (4) I've used the camera and video camera bunches of times with great results. Still no five stars because of the continued drops in the Internet connection, etc. (see above). But...if I had to buy a tablet TODAY, I would go right back and buy this one. I'm getting tons of hours of use every, single day for such a reasonable price. I adore this tablet.", "Title": "Solid, four-star tablet.

I own a galaxy tab two kindles and an iPad so I have had plenty of experience in the tablet field. That I think was my first problem ... you don't treat this as a tablet where you just download apps from the app store. If u do you will be disappointed. Think PC when ur using this. I gave it a four stars and not five mainly because the amount of time it took to update all the apps and the windows updates and while these are updating this tablet acts very odd ... such as things not working like apps or mail or downloading new apps. I was ready to return it...  but after the installs were complete everything was great. The best thing about this tab is that you use a full browser and can install real pc programs. The smart cover is decent and worth the money I paid for it. The best part is using my apple magic mouse and keyboard on the tab.. it works flawlessly. Windows 8 takes some getting used to and don't think that this tab is junk bc u don't like change because windows 8 is very intuitive and can make multitasking much easier than any other ios or android device. If u want to do real work instead of just playing angry birds this tab is a god choice for the price.", "Title": "Decent tablet for the money.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2EPCUKWDQVRBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I knew exactly what I was buying with this tablet, but I knew the harder sell would be my wife. She would just want it to \"work\". That being said, I did spend quite a bit of time customizing it to suit her, but at least I have those options. Anyway, I don't want this to turn into a review of Windows 8, so I'll try to stick to the hardware as much as possible. I'm really happy with this tablet, and I think it has the best combination of features and price compared to any of the others that I've looked at. I've really enjoyed using it and haven't had any issues, despite what I've been reading in other reviews. Here are my observations:I can confirm that this Vivotab Smart gets good \"idle\" times. I think I was gone for the day for about 12 hours while it was just sitting on my dresser and the battery barely lost any charge. Perfect! (considering that there is almost ZERO information available on how well these Windows tablets do on \"idle\" time)This tablet is one of the more feature packed ones available. I was surprised how many of the new windows tablets were lacking GPS. This one has it. It also has NFC. I'm still not sure how/if I'll use it, but it's nice to have the option. I had a hard time deciding between this and the Surface Pro. I ultimately decided upon this one based on features, since the Surface Pro has smaller cameras and no GPS. Also, the Surface is heavier and has a shorter battery life. What I later found out is that the Atom processor in this tablet supports the new low power states that are crucial for tablet-like behavior = long \"idle\" times where it is asleep, but not really asleep (what we all expect tablets to do when we're not using them). The Surface (having a relatively older Core i5 processor) doesn't support those features so (to my understanding) you're left with the old, relatively laptop-like sleep and hibernate states. Not very tablet-like where you just hit the button and it wakes up instantly.The screen is nice. The auto-brighness works well and responds quickly, but does \"jump\" and is not very smooth. Not a big deal, really. The speakers aren't overly loud but do sound nice, also not a big deal to me. The camera can take sharp, clear pictures that are very large, but doesn't respond well to varied lighting. I've seen this pointed out by other reviews. I wonder how much of that is the camera and how much of that is the software. It does take very nice picture if you are careful (or lucky) to take a picture in more even lighting, even if it is dark. The battery life has been good. I've used it for hours at a time watching videos, playing games, and installing apps without running the battery down. It seems to run at least as long as any iPad or iPhone I've ever used, maybe better.The Metro-style apps and interface are fast and responsive. I doubt there will be any problems with performance for tablet-like use. The desktop interface and programs are also fast and responsive. Though, I will admit that I haven't used any large or intense programs. But, it just feels \"fast enough\", so I think it will work out just fine. It handles the metro-app Netflix like a champ and even works well in the multi-task mode. I think MS really has a polished OS even though there are some kinks to work out, still. [Remember, iOS wasn't really all that great for the first year or two it was out - trust me, I owned the original iPhone]. One little \"feature\" that stuck me in particular was the ability to multi-task a metro app and the desktop at the same time. When you give the metro-app the larger portion of the screen, the desktop shrinks the open windows down to little preview windows and stacks them in the available screen space. It's really quite neat! That little feature (along with the other neat tricks) really made me appreciate Win 8 all the more.Microsoft Office came bundled with the tablet. There is a little \"Install\" button that starts the process and it was quick and painless. I think this is much better than the old days where it would come pre-installed but crippled in a trial mode. Also, on that note, there isn't much (if any) bloatware. There is the Asus Camera App and maybe one other, but that's it. Plus, I'll actually keep that particular app because of the added functionality, but I doubt I'll use it much.Word of warning: I saw a video review where someone described how easily the screen scratches. I decided not to chance it so I bought a screen protector right off the bat - I would highly advise anyone else to get one. I read a lot of reviews and got a good one, so it hasn't affected screen quality or touch responsiveness.If you're going to use a case, I bought a cheap one on here for about $15 by Moko and have been really pleased. It has a plastic back (covered with a faux leather) and a folding faux leather front cover. It's light, thin, and the folding cover acts as a stand. The cover also has the auto sleep/wake feature, which just makes the whole tablet seem sleeker, somehow. I also bought the official Asus TranSleeve Cover and Keyboard, but that has been a huge and expensive disappointment. I will probably keep it, though, because the keyboard is actually kind of nice. The cover, however, is a travesty. Get the cheap Moko one if you just want a cover/case.MoKo Ultra Slim Lightweight Smart-shell Stand Case for ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400 ME400C 10.1 inch Windows 8 tablet, BLACK (with Auto Wake/Sleep Function)", "Title": "Very Happy (and my wife is, too)", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "B Bob", "ReviewID": "R138LY7SF3L1XG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got one of these about a month or so ago. I think it's a (not perfect) but a great pick at the $400 price range.Overall I really like the tablet and the Windows 8 experience on a tablet.But I'll list a few things I didn't like, had a little trouble at first setting up the store and had to create a new microsoft account even though I already had one. But after the initial frustration not much problem there, although like someone else mentioned sometimes store updates/downloads are slow.The volume is a little low.The power button feels flimsy.Battery efficiency is definitely not as good as I expected. Turning wi-fi on and off when not in use helps. Have had no connectivity problems with wifi at all though.Is a little bit slow to charge compared to my LG phone.What I like ... I really like Windows 8 on the tablet, there were a few things I had trouble finding after being used to Win 7, but by going to the search box and looking it up I almost always found what I needed. I think the gestures are very intuitive. And the tablet was crucial for me for doing things like photo editing, html editing and FTP. I've tried doing those things on an android tablet previously and it is so so so much easier on a Win 8 tablet in desktop mode as you get true multitasking and quick switching from one program to another. The build quality seems pretty good, not the best but above average. Speed of the processor has not been an issue for me at all, I don't try doing intensive work on the tablet, usually just web resolution image editing and coding. Works great. The few games I've played have all worked great.", "Title": "Solid tablet", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kevin Nigg", "ReviewID": "RLE7CYYDSDKGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great value.  This is a solid and stylish tabet for the budget-minded Windows crowd.  I am not sure how fair it is to rate the Vivotab based on Windows8 as most of the difficulties cannot be overcome by hardware.  I must confess I have never touched an I-device, and never will.  I work in corporate IT support, so it's a Windows world for me.  I had to go ahead and get something with Win8 so I could stay ahead of support questions.  I cant imagine using only a tablet for 100% of computing needs, so my 4-start rating is based on the fact that I still use my desktop pc for real work, and my android phone for most on-the-go.  I got this so I could learn Win8 and take it on work travel.  It is replacing an Acer Iconia A100 android ics tablet.This came with some Asus bloatware, all but one was easily removed.  I ended up stopping an Asus backup software by removing it from startup in the registry.It was in need of a ton of updates.  Don't get too excited when your box arrives as you'll be leaving it on the charger running updates for about 4 hours.  Asus updater had 2 system updates as well - which scared me once as the reboot brought up a recovery screen.  Waiting 10 minutes and a reboot resolved and it showed the updates installed (bios and software).The Vivotab is very fast and smooth.  There is a delay when rotating the screen, nowhere near as fluid as my previous android devices.  Opening and changing apps is lightning fast.  The touch is super-responsive and awesome.  You would never complain about having only 2gb of ram.  My \"real\" PC's are 8gb ram and solid state drives, the Vivotab feels just as quick.The Office H&S; 13 license was in the package and download from MS was fast and it works well.  I did add MS Outlook 07 as I wanted to try a client in addition to outlook.com.  Office07 is obviously not touch-friendly, but it works.The front webcam is not wide-angle enough.  I have to be 4 or 5 feet away to appear \"normal-sized\" in webcam chat.  The camera seems to be pointed slightly to the side as well, so I have to angle it a little to the left. It is not because it is a little off-center, it seems the camera is crooked in there.  I'm not too concerned about it - I'll just adapt to it.  The rear camera is excellent, the best I've ever used.The first full charge took a long time, but I am enjoying about 9 hours of runtime.I like that it charges with micro-usb cable.  I got very tired of having to bring along proprietary chargers with previous devices.I was intrigued by the transleeve keyboard and cover, but opted for the standard book-style to start out (MoKi Slim Cover - fits and works well).As for Windows8, I was able to find enough apps in the store to satisfy me, but I will miss real google maps and some other g-stuff since I was using everything they had to offer on android (calendar/drive/keep/mail, etc..).If you want an affordable tablet running Win8 - this is a clear winner.", "Title": "Excellent as a \"supplemental\" device", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "Brian Keldsen", "ReviewID": "R2H8ZRF3RVMMZ1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased an Asus Vivotab Smart in April of this year and have had nothing but problems with it since I have had it.First, the sound started to cut out randomly requiring a restart in order to restore the sound.  When I called into customer service they had me do a \"Hard Reboot\" which resets the unit back to the factory defaults.  This was annoying to say the least as all the apps I had installed were erased.  What is worse is that the hard reboot did not fix the problem, the sound continued to cut out randomly requiring a restart to restore the system sound.This was the just the beginning of problems.  At this point (less than 2 and 1/2 months from the purchase date) the touch screen has begun to malfunction.  The unit behaves as if the touchscreen is being touched even when it just sits there being undisturbed by anyone.  This makes it very hard to navigate as the unit continues to behave that way as I try to use it. Apps will randomly launch, websites will randomly be navigated to (and away from) letters will randomly by typed, etc...Finally, the touchscreen keyboard has begun to malfunction.  There are time the 'a' key and the 'w' key just won't work.  They won't work in any app.  If you happen to have any of the failing characters in your password, you are up a creek.I have spend hours on the phone with Asus' lackluster customer service.  They had me send in the unit for repair - which they will ask you to do at your own expense unless you complain hard enough.  I followed the repair process through to the end and when I got the unit back I opened up anticipating that it was repaired.It wasn't.Nothing was fixed.Nothing at all.The same problem that led me to send it for repair were noticeable from the very first time I fired it up after getting it back from their \"repair\" facility.I should have known that this was likely as the Better Business Bureau has given Asus a failing rating (an F on a scale of A+ to F) and has a consumer alert against this company.  Apparently I am not the only one who sends Asus products off for repair only to receive them back just as broken.  According to the BBB:\"We have identified a pattern of complaints concerning service issues. Complaints processed by BBB claim that 1) products sent to the company for repairs are still not working properly when returned to the consumer.\"After all that expense, I anticipate having a very expensive paperweight.BEWARE!!!You might be one of the lucky consumers who have no problem with the product, but if you do have a problem, don't count on Asus standing behind their product or honoring their warranty.To this day Asus refuses to send me a suitable replacement or refund my investment.", "Title": "Buyer Beware", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "Redhawk44", "ReviewID": "R2WLF1TMNPI8S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this tablet for a couple days, so far I'm very pleased. the initial setup was smooth, although the windows updates took 40 minutes.

I loaded many programs including all those from my Windows 8 account with my old device, and it seemed it was going to work. I wrote an update on July 26th stating as such, but the last few days before finally throwing in the towel and requesting a refund, it just seemed to go downhill in a hand-basket!

Unexplained lapses of not connectivity to WiFi. Numerous reboots. Sound dropping out. Screen flickering on Auto and Manual settings. And the list goes on. ASUS Tech Support was decidedly useless except for recommending resets.I really had high hopes for this thing. Perhaps I will wait a little while before making a review.

It arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. It is a very attractive tablet, slightly bigger than an iPad but lighter in weight than the iPad. Unfortunately it turned out to be disappointing on a number of levels:-the touch screen did not always respond whether using one's finger or a stylus, or the response was delayed-when it was doing updates you frequently had no idea if it was working or not, downloading or not.  Unlike Windows updates that showed progress, other initial updates loaded (or didn't) with no visual indication of progress.  Based on reviews I had read of the ME400C-C1 I was cautious to try and not interfere with an ongoing download, but with no indication as to whether it was successfully downloading or not, that is hard to comply with.  This is particularly frustrating when you are doing the initial machine updates fresh out of the box.-downloads were painfully slow in spite of a very fast connection-the set up font is very small and you can not adjust its size until after fully setting up the machine.  This presented a problem when for example Microsoft put up a 'person verifier' set of letters that you then had to enter to proceed.  The letters were frequently very difficult to decipher and often took multiple tries.-the volume of the speaker (only comes from the left side) is too low to be of any value-the WiFi, while easy to set up, frequently dropped without any apparent reason even though it showed full bars and was a very strong signal-Asus system updater indicated there was a new version and once downloaded it would not run (even after 3 attempts)Bottom line is that I was hoping this would be a viable replacement for my traveling laptop but feel it is not stable enough or reliable enough to serve that role.

Of course, you will have to understand that Windows 8 is a double-edge sword since it is poorly designed as tablet operating system (e.g. the on-screen keyboard does not always pop-up, a little bit frustrating when using IE which first switches you in desktop mode and then does not pop the keyboard and rescale the windows to account for the keyboard...).I am not giving it three stars because of windows 8 (as said I selected this tablet because of the versatility that Windows 8 offers knowing some of its drawbacks).  The three stars goes to Asus conception:- The tablet comes without any product key for Windows 8 (Or at least mine) - In the likely event that windows 8 ends up corrupted, how do I reinstall the OS without product key???!!!- The lack of documentation on Asus accessories for this tablet- The available accessories (A bluetooth keyboard and protective sleeve) are not well designed... It made great sense to me to have done the keyboard a docking station allowing charging the tablet and more USB port.I have also experienced few bugs or problems:- No wireless signal after one update forcing to shutdown and restart the tablet (pretty scary since the tablet came without the windows product key...)- Poor response of the screen- Possible crash of windows app update process likely due to the slow processing power (Try to do 19 app update and add to do it sequentially to see real progress...).- Microsoft office 2010 was installed but the given product key was for the 2013 version.This tablet will do fine for me...

I also bought the Asus KeyThe Good:It's Windows, so it will be seamless with your desktop/laptop if you are a Windows user. Additionally, I can with adapter access external hard drives and even CD/DVD drives.Decent battery life, probably close to the advertised 9.5 hours with a light utilization (browsing, email), longer on airplane mode since power isn't being used for wi-fi. Keep in mind it's Intel Atom so heavy duty activities will or even impossible on tablers64GB is is a good start for capacity.Runs smoothly, certainly for basic usage, and even light gaming, works pretty good, SD video smooth, no noticeable jitter, haven't tried HD as the screen resolution doesn't support it.The touchscreen works pretty well.MicroSD is a godsend!Has front and rear cameras.The Bad:64GB isn't really enough, about 33GB is already taken by OS and other system files - and that doesn't include the Office 2013 install. Highly recommend getting a MicroSD card, indeed I immediately bought a 64GB card.I would prefer a display at HD resolutions, even 1280 x 720, preferably full HD. Perhaps the next incarnation. As it is, the tablet is a bit too rectangular though that does make it easier to hold with one hand.It doesn't have 3g/4g. not personally a concern for me, but others might want that option. Being where I am, I often need a USB 3G modem to get on the net, and with the adapter, you can get 3G access if you really need to.The screen seems very susceptible to finger prints, surprising to me considering my Asus Nexus 7 isn't. The Asus keyboard cover is very handy as I don't need to touch the screen.Overall, I give it 4 stars. I have no regrets getting this, and using it a lot already.

The first call to ASUS told me that my tablet was loaded with Office 10. I tried activating Office 10 with the given product key and it wouldn't work, of course. MS support verified that the product key was certainly not for Office 10. After three days of trying obvious trouble shooting strategies, a second call was made to ASUS. After rehearsing what I had tried and learned, it was concluded that I needed to send the tablet to ASUS.

The Atom processor is certainly not an I series processor found in most modern computers, however short of serious gaming or heavy data processing it does the job just fine. While the Atom lacks the speed of a regular computer processor the solid state drive loads windows and applications extremely fast. The Atom is also super power efficient and the battery lasts a very long time. I use this a lot on the couch after work (probably more than most people) and I still only charge it a few times a week. The screen resolution is very good and the tablet streams hd video (ie Hulu) effortlessly. The only real drawbacks with this is the lack of a full sized usb port.. I believe you can get an adaptor from many places online though. Also, windows 8 eats a lot of the 64gb drive leaving you with less than half of it left out of the box. A larger drive would be nicer... but then again this is a tablet and probably should not be used to house tons of data anyways (that's what your regular computer is for).

I had hoped that this tablet would combine the best of the two, and become my tablet of choice.  I quickly realized I was wrong.Cons:1. MONO - Mono sound from the left of the device.  After just one day, it has been driving me crazy.  Keyboard clicks, music, games... everything in my left ear.  A speaker at the bottom, even muffled by my lap, would have made for a more pleasant experience.  Let's face it, mono is unacceptable in a device larger than a phone, and for it to be skewed to either side is very unnatural.  I would welcome a clip-on stereo Bluetooth unit to even out the sound; it is THAT annoying.2. ENDLESS BOOT LOOP - I installed the Asus BIOS update while downloading Windows updates, and the tablet was locked in a unbootable loop.  It took special command line procedures to re-image the tablet to factory state (which I can provide if needed) and about a day's worth the research to figure them out.  This is totally unacceptable for an out-of-the-box experience.  (Windows Restore, Refresh, and Reset were unable to fix the issue.)3. CHARGING - Even the iPad power adapter (with appropriate USB cable) isn't powerful enough to charge the device while in use.  The Kindle Fire adapter, however, does appear to provide enough power to charge the tablet while operating.  The Samsung charges in less than two hours, the VivoTab RT boasts 16 hours runtime with dock (charging briefly every few days).Pros:1. The finish is slightly rubbery feeling.  Moist or dry hands can hold this device securely without concern of it slipping from a light grip and being dropped.  The Samsung is way too slick.  The VivoTab RT has a nice metal finish, with just the right rubbery plastic for grip.2. Zippy - performs as fast as would be expected from a device its size.3. Form factor - It's the right size to hold on a lap, etc., a comfortable weight, and objects on screen are not too big and not too small.Other:I write software using Microsoft platforms, so I liked the idea of a compact \"programming-capable\" tablet.  The Samsung is a little large, and the VivoTab RT is unable to run development software because of Microsoft's foolish decision to lock-down the desktop, rather than implement x86-ARM compatibility libraries.  I digress...In all, I think I will continue to carry my VivoTab RT around with me, and use my Samsung for leisure at home.  Although I intended this device to fill both roles, it just doesn't.

Oy. Finally got enough of them to get win 8.1. then the apps wouldnt install anymore. argh! did troubleshooter again, dunno if it worked, but got fed up and turned it off over night. next day apps were installing and working fine. weird. so far it is not too bad. some apps dont always work, and still trying to figure out Office program...it doesnt always want to do as i ask, rnot sure if its me or windows fault tho. Tab would be awesome if windows were more streamlined resource wise. wouldnt hurt to have more ram or faster cpu of course, but for what i paid, i am happy enough. super happy with hdmi port to my tv.,works nicely and,looks great. going to give my printer a try tomorrow. hope it works so i can make this a good extra to my laptop.  screen is plenty sharp for reading for a while, just take regular breaks.buttons on the desktop portion are really small when in tablet mode, (no mouse etc.) but can semi fix that by pressing on wallpaper until menu opens, like a right click. then tap screen resolution, then 'make text and other items bigger', and check box choose one scaling option. then adjust by custom size to your liking. experiment,a bit. i set mine to 135% and is not too bad over all now..one thing i really like is the skydrive/Onedrive thing. it shares stuff between all my pcs without having to know how to set up any networking stuff, and even my windows phone which is great, so i now have all my pics from the day off the phone no prob. no more putting stuff on a flash drive or sd card and trying to transfer between pcs or always emailing to myself.dont like long typing with onscreen keyboard tho. have found that out writing this review.If MS would just get it together a little more they'd have a,seriously productive and usable platform for everything.

Sometimes the screen goes blank and won't respond and I have to do a hard reset, but I don't know if this is due to the Windows program or the Asus hardware. Had it do so when using the camera app and when removing the HDMI cable from using the TV with it.

I purchased this tablet to test out something I am working on with a Win8 device.  The Vivotab Smart has a great display, is reasonably fast, comes with 64 gbyte (expandable) and has a very sharp front facing camera.  True, the case it plastic, but like most people I enclosed it in a carrying case the day I bought it, so I consider that a non issue.  However, I almost returned it the day I received it, because out of the box it was slow and the touchscreen was twitchy.  I ran it through it's over the air update and FIVE HOURS LATER it was working perfectly and I have never looked back.  Asus should ship this with a big red sticker that says \"Wait...don't try anything until you run the update.\"I hated Windows 8.0 (\"metro\") when I first previewed it a few years ago, but after using 8.1 on a tablet for two weeks I have to say I am coming to like it a lot.  It is a very well thought out mobile operating system, with many clever innovations.  It's not quite as easy to use as iOS, but as others have pointed out, this is a complete full-featured operating system packed into a tablet device.  An iPad is great for surfing, emailing, and updating your Facebook status.  A Win 8 tablet like the Vivotab Smart is for really getting things done... working on Word, Excel, and Powerpoint docs in their native formats, connecting to other filesystems, moving big chunks of data on and off the device using a thumbdrive, etc. These are all things you simply cannot do on an iPad.I would have given this device 5 stars except for the awful out of box experience, but I would certainly recommend it to anyone who needs a tablet for productivity.

The power button works intermittently.  The Wifi is spotty at finding networks when the router was only 5 feet away.  Buttons on the screen were often unresponsive.  Application software runs so slowly that it is hard to tell when that machine is running and when it has seized up.  When installing Windows updates, it is common for the machine to seize.It may be that Asus built a cheap machine.  It may be that Windows 8 is just too demanding for the small power in the tablet.  It may be that the Intel Atom is just too weak for Windows 8.  Whatever the source or sources of the problems, the machine rarely works well and often fails to work.I am a professor and bought the machine to replace printed lecture notes.  It is humiliating when, standing in front of a class, and the tablet fails to come to life when the power button is pushed.Asus support is helpful in tone, but their only assistance is to say, \u201cSend it back.\u201d  I have sent the machine in for repairs four times.  It seems that Asus should be able to get it right after that many attempts.  Each time is comes back having wiped out my data and application software which takes hours to reload.

I went online to see if there was a quick fix for it and there is nothing that quickly addresses the problem. Instead of messing with the updates, I tried to open an app already installed. I opened the preloaded Netflix app. It said \"must install the latest version before you can use it\". So I hit update and it won't update just like the rest of the programs. At this point the frustration was growing. I searched and searched and still have not been able to fix it. I don't know if this problem exists in all the ASUS ME400C tablets, but it happened to me.

When we tried to install Windows, we were told it was only available to use in Asia. We called several times trying to figure out why units were being sold in America with only the 2013 Windows available to Asian clients. Asus just keeps saying, \"I'm sorry. Windows 2013 is only available in Asia.\" (Uh, yeah, thanks, but how about answering the question!)After much debate with no help, Asus told us our only option was to send the 2013 Asian copy back to them and wait for the 2010 American version. There was no attempt to compensate us for our inconvenience, and two weeks later we're still waiting for them to send the copy of Windows that they promised.My husband is very happy with the features that he is actually able to use. Unfortunately customer service stinks, and my husband isn't able to use a main feature on a tablet that we purchased mainly for that reason. Would I get an Asus product again?  Probably not.

It seems to respond better when I do this. All in all, not bad if you like Windows 8 tablets.

I can't fault Asus on this one as much as I fault Microsoft.  I applaud Microsoft for their forward method of thinking with Windows 8, it just needs A LOT of work and time to mature.What's the main problem?Lets start with touch optimization.  When it comes to Windows there are FAR too many applications and programs that require a mouse and keyboard to navigate through and operate comfortably.  On Android tablets, EVERYTHING is touch optimized.  Android and Apple have spent years perfecting their mobile OS devices and have battled to be at where they are right now.  Microsoft just saw a big piece of \"financial\" pie and thought, why not us?  They have A LOT of work to do.  Once you navigate outside the Start Screen, this device is a nightmare to use.  That is pretty much the jist of it.  Windows 8 is not a horrendous operating system, it just needs a mouse and keyboard, like Windows always has been.  If Microsoft wants to succeed in the world of mobile devices like tablets and phones, they need to develop a seperate OS that is 100% optimized for touch.  They keep pushing this whole \"universal\" thing with the Windows 8 format, on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones.
