{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Philip Scoggins", "ReviewID": "R253QAA85JK6L8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My daughter has been saving her chore money for several months to buy a tablet, she's 5, and I'm very proud of her restraint in saving.So needless to say, I researched heavily to find a sub $100 tablet for her that wasn't a waste of her hard earned cash (her 7yr old sister blew all she's made, so I'm hoping to encourage the idea of saving for something nice)I decided on the Hisense Sero 7 LT because of the processor speed, 1gb of ram and the microsd card expansion slot. It functions much better than I thought a $79 tablet would and am very satisfied with it performance.  Wifi strength is nothing to brag about and the battery empties pretty quickly, but we can deal with those.  Don't have exact numbers on battery life yet, but would guess at about 3 hours, I'll try to update that later.I was about to pull the trigger and order online when I was checking out a few last reviews and realized it was being sold at Wal-Mart.  So I drove down to my local store and bought it for $79.99 + $7 for a 2 year replacement plan (more on that later).It did some funny things during initial setup, but I think it just has a funky setup routine.  It looks great, touch screen works nicely & I download all of my kids apps from my google account to it easily.  The only apps that weren't compatible were the ones that needed a 3d rendering video chip.  It has a full google play app & currently runs Android 4.1.  Only has a selfie camera at very low resolution and its on the top left corner which made it very hard to find a case that would secure the tablet, but not cover the camera (she's 5 remember, case a must)Things were great until 1 day into it I showed her that when we get out of the car you put the tablet between the door and the seat so it's not laying out in the back seat tempting someone to break my window for a $79 tablet.  Well, long story short, when I closed the door, the clearance in the back seat isn't like the drivers & I broke her screen.  Took it back to Wal-Mart & they swapped it right out (15 minutes in and out the door), reinstalled everything & runs great again.  (So that's pointing out I've used 2 of them & they consistently work well).I guess that one of the ways they save money on the tablet is in the glass.  I've got an Asus Transformer tablet with Gorilla glass & it cost MUCH more than my daughter's & I would have to guess some of that went to a superior glass.  I've ordered a screen protector to help protect it from the inevitable drops & falls, but the best investment was the 2 year replacement plan.  Not to plug Wal-Mart too much, but it sure was handy to just swap it out and not have to ship it off and wait for weeks to get it back.", "Title": "Very good tablet", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "Gary L.

No it isn't, It's not suppose to be. This is a inexpensive tablet that will perform quite well for a child or a first time user. I have an iPad and a Galaxy Tab 2. The Sero responds to my touch just as well the Galaxy Tab and the processor appears to be just as fast. I have been able to run Netflix and play Youtube videos without any issues. The camera on this unit is terrible, I admit, but I certainly knew that when I was researching the specifications of the tablet. You're not going to get a 5 or 6 megapixel camera in a sub $100 tablet. If you want an inexpensive tablet to surf the web, check facebook, play games, or run Netflix, this tablet can handle that. I bought this one for my 6 year old and it's a perfect first tablet.", "Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Rocker", "ReviewID": "R11LL58WLXASQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet is a good option for those seeking a high end budget tablet. It compares to the Nexus 7 at a price of $149 or lower. I have had mine for about 3 months now, without any issues. You can down load the manual off the internet for free. I am no guru of tablets but I do extensive research before I make a bank for the buck purchase. It's an android so it does have things getting use to. It's Google based but this is no issue as you learn the system and quirks. Nice tablet for the buck and the quad processor is a plus for those who seek speedier results. ... I also have purchased a Hisence 32 inch TV which  my 4 year old grandson plays games and watches DVDs cartoons on - so far no issues and very pleased after several months of use.", "Title": "Hisence Zero 7 - Another \"Bang for the buck\"", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "VK418", "ReviewID": "RH5L3HRLWDENR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this tablet! This is my first tablet even though I'm pretty tech savvy. I was on a budget and at Walmart. I heard pretty good reviews on here and word of mouth so I purchased it. I had it out of the box and up and running (via free WiFi) before I left the store. I have no complaints other than the back is very very easy to scratch so don't leave the store / order without the proper protection. I was aware of the lack of a camera flash, not needed really when I have an excellent cam on my GS2. My only other very minor issue is that you have to find a hotspot when your out, luckily I have WiFi at home. Great purchase for kids to adults. Make use of Google Play Store and link your Google accounts and it makes this tablet much more useful/fun.", "Title": "love it!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Author": "Kira schermerhorn", "ReviewID": "R3TG8O8JMHCDE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My sister owns this tablet.
