{"Reviews": [{"Author": "msschemist@yahoo.com", "ReviewID": "R345AIH47OJPIV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading reviews, I finally chose this jewel of a tablet.  It was so easy to set up. The graphics are so clear. It smoothly paired with my android Cricket phone as well as the blue tooth keyboard. At a fingers touch, it also connected to house Wi-Fi.  I immediately linked to my email and many apps.  This beautiful tablet came loaded with much more than what I expected.  I took nice photos, bank online, read from Google books and listened to clear music. The speakers are located on the front and sound great.  I'm so happy because I don't have to lug my heavy 5-yr old pc.  I can sit next to my dad on sofa while we use this light, cool tablet to watch news, YouTube clips, listen to music & connect with family.  I think this is a great deal for the price $249.00 because it came with a dock and keyboard. UPDATE: The tablet works well with photo/file cloud services. It plays Netflix, YouTube and HuluPlus videos well, Previously installed adroid compatible flashplayer via adobe's archive, but no longer works on Amazon instant videos.  So installed glitchy Puffin Free to access Amazon Instant Videos.  How strange that Amazon does not sell a flash player app so Prime members who bought android devices on Amazon can access videos. SO FINALLY I DECIDED if my android tablet can not access Prime videos, why keep the Prime membership?  Customer service agreed and refunded the full amount I paid for Prime.;)", "Title": "So delighted with this, except for...little problem with Amazon instant videos", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1F6AY66MKXNYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not a bad tablet for the price. I ordered this tablet bundle on a whim and I have not been disappointed. I love the Android OS and it seems much more user friendly than IOS. Having also owned an Ipad I can say that I prefer the Android. Graphics seem plenty adequate. In my opinion as far as my eye can see, the difference between the graphics on this tablet and the Ipad 3 are minimal. Sure the Ipad has better numbers in the specs but in reality the difference is subtle and I am able to do so much more with this tablet that suites my needs. The keyboard works great and the docking stand is a nice addition if you want to use your tablet more like a computer. Battery life is excellent. I use  the tablet multiple times throughout the day and the battery lasts pretty much from the time I get up until I go to bed then I charge it overnight. Also the front firing speakers are a plus with decent audio quality and plenty of volume. Apps are plentiful for this tablet and I haven't had any problems finding what I need. Streaming video over the internet works great too and yes, it does work with Adobe Flash player which is sweet. The only possible negative that I can think of is that the charging port is on the bottom of the tablet below the Samsung logo. I think it would have been more convenient if it had been on the left or right side of the tablet but I don't consider it to be a huge deal. In all if you are considering an Ipad I think this is a great alternative that wont disappoint. Also it is about half the price of the Ipad. In addition (unlike with the Ipad) you can add additional memory via a micro sd card which works great. I'm not trying to give the Ipad a bad rap with my review because they are excellent tablets in their own right. I'm simply using it as a platform to base my review off of as I am familiar with them. I just think this unit is much more user friendly and allows more flexibility in making it do what you want it to do. In all I think this is a great tablet for the price and you definitely get more than you pay for which is rare these days. Again these are just my opinions but I am very satisfied with my purchase of this tablet.Additional Note: One reason I bought this tablet is because I am an avid photographer and I wanted a photo storage medium to travel with. I can transfer my photos to this tablet from my camera and I don't have to lug around a huge laptop plus I have most other conveniences of a computer. This is much easier and lighter to travel with and there are plenty of photography apps for this tablet, especially for reading camera raw files. I can't do a lot of hardcore photo editing but that is not my intent so much as a storage platform until I get back home where I can transfer them to the computer.", "Title": "Better than I expected.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "David D. Gali II", "ReviewID": "R1W2S14JITCO3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews and looking into the Tab 3, I definitely wanted to get another Tab 2 before they are not available any more.With the added keyboard and stand it's very handy on my desk.  I added a small Bluetooth mouse to make this a perfect little half-way computer. The keyboard seems to work flawlessly and the keystroke reaction time is good. I'm a computer and network administrator, and I'm always on the go and not in an office. I maintain about 30 computers remotely and can access them all from my tablet to perform small tasks. And tethered to my phone allows me to do all that on the go. I am also a musician and perform out a lot. So I have gotten rid of my music binder and music stand, and now use the tablet for all my sheet/chart music, attached to my microphone stand. It's awesome!  One problem I ran into with this product was with Samsung, when it/they offered an upgrade with the firmware and Android OS, which I regretfully accepted and performed. It upgraded the Android system from 4.1.1 to 4.2.2, which I immediately hated in every way. (Specifically where it changed the location of the home and back buttons, as well as the menu options. Simply annoying.)  Then it/they would not allow me to go back to the previous version.  After some time I was able to download the previous firmware and an installation utility to reset the system back to the previous firmware and OS. So it's back to the way I loved it when I purchased it.  (Basically,\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\")  I definitely love this product and use it daily.", "Title": "I definitely love the Samsung tablets (We now have two of them)", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "LaDonna Elliott", "ReviewID": "R11R3IDQY4P3TQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Never owning a tablet before and working over what I wanted, a tablet or a laptop, this is a cool little tablet.POSITIVE: It satifies the need for both a laptop or a tablet.  I'm able to do some of my office work on it, and at the same time download whatever receipe, craft, app I want.POSITIVE: It's very simple to work with.  My 2.5yr old grandson and computer illiteral, new-fangle gadget technically challenged husband both play games on it, and can find them with great ease by flipping the pages.POSITIVE: I love the fact that it has it's own stand and own blue tooth keyboard.  This feature gives it that quick feeling of a laptop and the quick typing on a keyboard rather than a \"swipe board\".POSITIVE: It's easy to learn and find applications ~ that's the biggest neatest thing about it.  There are no hidden folders, hidden apps.NEGATIVE: It lacks is a camera flash and a USB port.NEGATIVE: When there are android / platform updates, there are SERIOUS UPDATES, which change keyboards, screens, app preferences, etc.NEGATIVE: A lot of the Google Play apps want to know location, location, location. Really?  Do they REALLY need to know my location for me to download their program?NEGATIVE: There is not a help guide that comes with the book.POSITIVE: The Samsung service support desk is very quick to answer the calls, extremely knowledgable about current updates/upgrades, and speak very clearly and comprehensively, not like some call centers where you have to have an interpreter on the line with you.", "Title": "Awesome little tablet, missing camera flash/USB, android updates change platform", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Memaw 43", "ReviewID": "R2SVEIMA1BGEVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very responsive tablet and very sensitive to the touch.

Ipad was just too expensive for what my mom needs.  Came across this one and bought it.  I am very impressed after using it for about a week .  It is not as seamless as an OSX device but for the money I do not believe it can be beat.  I'm seriously thinking about buying one for myself.The screen although not a retina display is really very good.  The forward firing speakers are a welcomed feature and it is lighter in weight compared to the iPad, very nice to handle and hold.  I have to say I've been reaching for this device over my iPad lately.  I really like the stand and keyboard that come with this package.  Is nice to have when you just want to park yourself at the table and do some emails or web searchs.
