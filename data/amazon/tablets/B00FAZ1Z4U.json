It has great parental controls that I can access anywhere via a website, sends me emails when they download some app, go to a forbidden website, etc. (which can get annoying at times, especially when downloading new apps when seeing up the tablet) ... Functional use of this tablet is nice, I just downloaded the Amazon appstore to get better apps than the tabeo app store was offering, that made it sooo much better! Base tabeo app store is lacking.  Downloading new apps and installing them takes patience as it is not that fast, partly because I think it is adding the apps to the online database so you can approve them on the parental website, the other half is the tablets limited technology, so you have to wait for each app to finish downloading, then installing before you can move to the next app .  Some of the preloaded apps are annoying because of registrations, but after that, they don't have a lot of spying technology that normal apps do, so that is the upside to the painful registration process.I didn't have a lot of issues with the tablet app restarting EXCEPT for some of the installed apps, which was quickly resolved by downloading different apps of the same genre from the Amazon app store .  I even downloaded netflix and hulu so she could watch movies :-) Pictures that are taken by the tablet are of course lacking, but it's a kid's tablet.  Controls are decent once you get the hang of it, I actually like the split pulldown menu as it doesn't take up the whole screen like normal android pulldown menus do.  Touch controls at the bottom are nice and frustrating, all at the same time for younger kids (under 3), but it takes patience and training.  Overall I gave it a 4 because of the parental features, plus once I got the Amazon app store, that helped... It's decent for younger kids (7 -8 or younger), apps run well after installed.  If you know how to navigate around, this surprisingly isn't to shabby.  Again, I have had NO issues with apps after I got away from preloaded apps, if I do have issues, I  will come back here to tell everyone :-) Overall, I purchased mine for $125 on sale and I think it is worth this price, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND PAYING MUCH MORE FOR THIS UNIT.", "Title": "Actually good", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "Rachel Frank", "ReviewID": "R44BNSTK8LR3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Total junk.

If I had the ability to give this product negative stars I would.  The tablet i VERY slow, the way it is set up uses so much of the memory that it just drags and drags when trying to load games.  I think that having only a 1.0 ghz processor has something to do with that.  I am also not a fan of the parental control which is set up online through an application which is essentially held in the \"cloud\".  Lesson learned....I will never do this again.Our main reason for purchasing this tablet prior to Christmas was so that our daughter could use it for a vacation we were going on.  However, low-and-behold it was practically useless due to some error which occurred in the parental control application.  By the time we realized it, we were in no way able to fix the problem.  We were on a cruise, so getting WiFi without having to pay an arm and a leg was impossible.  So, we suffered through not being able to play any games and only using it to play a movie that we loaded onto the tablet prior to leaving for vacation.Even now that we are home, my daughter hardly uses the thing.  That, and alot of the free aps are just garbage!  There are advertisements on alot of them, which gets screwy with the parental controls as well.The only thing that was positive about this entire experience was the fact that we have 45 days to return the item in its original box with the shipping receipt.

It is marketed as \u201chigh impact\u201d yet my daughter dropped hers from about only a foot up by accident about 10 minutes in and the LCD screen is completely shot. Tabeo/Toys\u2019r'Us support said there is a limited warranty that only covers \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s defects\u201d (of course). So now I have a really upset 7 year old and am out 150 bucks.The tabeo website and the profil websites are also a piece of junk. I have been in IT for 16 years. Clearly they didn\u2019t load test these sites in anticipation of the numbers of concurrent users they would have on Christmas. Sounds a lot like another site that had this problem recently (healthcare.gov). Did CGI build this one too? No one could get in, people (including me) were double/triple charged for the MPF profil account, and the support chat did not work.All around, please do not invest in this tablet. You may as well just buy your kids a decent low-priced android based tablet and use free open software to monitor and provide parental controls. Certainly I should have.

We bought this for my son for xmas BIG MISTAKE! We bought it in Dec and we got it home and wanted to charge it up for my son so he could play on xmas. Realized the cable would not charge it. Toys r us says absolutely no returns it\u2019s out of their hands. Called tabeo and they sent out another cable. Took over two weeks for that. Get the cable and realize that if you just slightly move it, it stops charging meaning the defect is internal. Once again we are left with a paper weight and a wasted xmas present. Tabeo says ok send it back and we will replace it. We have to pay for shipping to ship it back and they received it jan 24th, but did not even put it in their system until a week later. was told it would be 10-15 business days from the date they had in their system. well 15 days went by and nothing. we called to see what was going on and was told the product was on back order and would be shipped as soon as they got some in and that it should only be a couple more days. very frustrated we again contacted toys r us with no help. two weeks go by again and call tabeo back and again told that they were still on back order and told again that it should only be a couple more days and then they would ship it out. at this point it was almost three months after xmas and my son got to play with his present maybe a total of two hours. and tabeo had our tablet for over a month of that. it is the beginning of march and we are STILL awaiting a replacement. was told by tabeo that our only option at this point is that they can send us our broken one back, or wait for the replacement. refused to let us go get a replacement from the store ( because you know toys r us are stocked with them but yet they are on backorder?) or a refund. and when asked why we couldn\u2019t get a refund they said because we did not buy from them directly, and when asked how do you buy from them directly they responded by \"you cant\". we have now went to corporate with toys r us and we will see if that gets us any closer. hard to explain to a 6 year old why his xmas present basically got taken away from him.Bottom Line: Tabeo has the worst customer service ever!!! They do not want to stand behind their product and Toys R Us states their hands are tied.

Fulson", "ReviewID": "RXUJ6VBBWN75J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off I have to say that the Tabeo E2 looks really nice and is packaged very well.  I bought two Tabeo E2 tablets, a blue one for my son and a pink one for my daughter for Christmas at my local Toys R Us Store.  Unlike other reviewers that state that they cannot set up their parental controls I was able to setup the parental controls without difficulty.  However that is when the problems started.  The parental control blocked EVERYTHING (even the pre-loaded apps) on the Blue Tabeo.  I made some adjustments to the filter by allowing everything except for porn and violence and tried playing the games again with no luck.  I got frustrated and tried to set up the parental controls on the Pink Tabeo.  I was able to set up parental controls but as soon as I opened certain apps like My Little Pony that came pre-loaded it would crash and the tablet would restart (it seems to take forever for these tablets to load after being turned on or restarting).  I tried contacting customer support on the tablet and the Mobile Parental Filter took me to the home screen with a message that said APP BLOCKED: check parental filters on Mobile Parental Filter on left corner of the screen.  I tried to tap the mobile parental filter on the screen as it said to do and nothing ever happened.  I used the Blue Tabeo to try to contact customer support and I got through and typed my message in.  No joke I waited for 52 minutes for someone to respond telling me that the network is down and try to be patient.  While I was waiting all that time for that very helpful response I used the Pink Tabeo to go back to the Parental Control site online and unchecked EVERYTHING.  I took off all filters just to see if the tablet would respond better to the apps without the parental filter on.  I had no such luck.Their App store was pretty disappointing as well.  I was able to install some games from the app store and they would work on the Pink Tabeo sometimes.  Another issue with the app store that I had is the fact that the games available are not very popular and most of the apps that have reviews are very low but no comments are available to read.  I was never able to download the Amazon App store like the Toys R Us Tabeo E2 Q&A; section says that I should have been able to. The parental filter blocked me from downloading it.  I spent about 3 hours Christmas Eve trying to set these tablets up and they were a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  When I took them back to the store the lady behind the counter actually told me she is tired of the Tabeo E2 because LOTS of people were returning them.  When I looked behind her on the shelves beneath the counter there were about 20 Tabeos that had been returned just that morning.  Like I said in the beginning, they are really nice visually to look at, but when you go to actually use them they are a junk.", "Title": "Buyer Beware", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Author": "JPP", "ReviewID": "RSFXBK3BGNIR8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this for our daughter for Christmas because she loves playing on my iPod.

On Christmas morning my boys opened their tablets and wanted to play with them, but I was made to register the parental control first before they could play.I took the tablets into a quite place while they continued to play in an effort to register them without notice.  While the registration process seemed easy enough this is were the drama began!On both tablets simultaneously, I got to stage one of the process, and then to stage two, but I was unable to check the box on either tablet.  So I shut the system down and tried again... but no luck. So I attempted this process four more times before attempting to contact Tabeo tech support.  Guess what?  Their 24/7 tech support line was busy, and busy and busy; why couldn't they at least leave a message stating the obvious --- we're experiencing server issues and we're working diligently to resolve the problem or something like that, but not just a busy signal (I am still receiving a busy signal the day after Christmas).  So I tried their Chat Support, but no one would pick up and therefore I kept receiving a dialog box in which to leave message.  I then emailed them and 24 hours later I've yet to receive a reply.  And I am not at all sure why there are Chat Support Apps on the tablet when you can't chat until your Parental Control has been set up.I tried for hours, 13 hours to be exact to register these tablets.  And perhaps the most frustrating part was whenever I would get to step three and/or step four, I would be sent back to step one (very frustrating).I am not sure who wrote the program for this worthless device, but if they should be FIRED immediately if not sooner.  Imagine all of the children who received this for Christmas and were disappointed that Santa would bring them something that didn't work.Here's an idea for the geniuses at Tabeo/Toys R Us, rewrite the program and allow the children to play with some of the Apps that are rated kid friendly so that they could at least have access to their Christmas present and then have the parents register the tablet when the child needed access to the Internet.
