{"Reviews": [{"Author": "OkinawanMatt", "ReviewID": "RP3ZVDB9LP7PM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hope to give the most comprehensive review of this Lenovo Lynx K3011W tablet.After reading benchmark and reviews about the new Atom processor, I found that the Intel Atom Z2760 would outperform any nVidia Tegra 3 configurations, which is exactly what I wanted to hear since I was extremely tired of the standard tablet OSes; I've owned iOS, WebOS and Android devices for several years and it's always bothered me that I was always limited in productivity.  I had always wished that I could have a full x86 environment so that I could install and run every app that I use for work and school while still having a multimedia consumption device that I could hold with one hand.  After a couple of weeks of use, I have found that this is the exact device that I needed.I have compared this tablet in person with the Asus VivoTab Smart, but I would rather have the brighter screen, louder stereo speakers, and the dockable keyboard that offers additional USB ports and its own battery.  The Lenovo IdeaPad Lynx K3 has an MSRP value that's about $150 more than the Asus VivoTab Smart and it is also 0.2 pounds heavier.  However, I was able to buy it on sale for less than the price of the VivoTab and I felt that the 0.2 pounds in weight was negligible.I was able to use the HP Envy X2 Hybrid Tablet as well.  While the X2 is sold with the keyboard included, the MSRP is $850.  It has been sold for $600 on sale recently, which is a good price for these Hybrid Tablet devices if it were to include a dockable keyboard.  Unfortunately, the X2 tablet was bulky due to its thickness, and it was approaching the 2-pound mark at a little over 1.7 pounds.  The X2 felt more like it was built to be a laptop than a stand-alone tablet.  However, the Beats branded audio in the X2 as significantly louder than either the Lenovo Lynx or the Asus VivoTab Smart.There are other options for Hybrid Tablets.  The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 has firmware, driver and chipset issues, and it is more expensive than the Lenovo IdeaPad Lynx.  The Acer W510 is much heavier than the IdeaPad Lynx.  Much like the HP X2, the Samsung ATIV is bulky and heavy.  The AsusVivoTab full version is much more expensive than its counterpart of the VivoTab Smart.  The Microsoft Surface RT has the restricted \"Windows RT\" system that will not allow the user to install their own programs, as well as having the slower nVidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor.  I considered purchasing the full Windows Surface Pro tablet but due to its thickness and weight, it would have made more sense to purchase a Lenovo Twist at that point.  Therefore, it was an easy choice for me to purchase the IdeaPad Lynx over any of the other offerings in this category.----------------------------------------CONS----------------------------------------I'll start the formal review with a list of negative aspects of this tablet.  The worst physical aspect of the tablet is that the volume rocker on the side of the tablet.  It rattles because it sits loose in its housing; this doesn't seem to be a defect but a design choice.  Also, since it sits nested (inset) instead of sitting flush at the edge, it's extremely hard to push the buttons with your fingers.  You will need to use your fingernails to reach in and push the rocker buttons.I wish the microphone was better at picking up my voice.  When placing it two feet away from me, it picked up my voice and cut out background noise, but my voice sounded whisper-quiet.  If I tilted the tablet's top edge toward me, it picked up my voice clearly.  If Lenovo had intended the microphone to be directional, it would have made more sense to find a way for Lenovo to mount the microphone port facing the user.Other users complain about the edges of the tablet but I didn't find it an issue; it didn't cut into my hand, doesn't feel uncomfortable after hours of holding it, etc.  I wish the back didn't feel like hollow plastic, but since there isn't much 'give' to the plastic, it's just a superficial nitpick.  However, I can imagine that accidentally putting weight on this device will destroy the screen since it provides the structural integrity.  In comparison, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 or the HP Envy X2 have either metal housings inside or are constructed of aluminum on the outside so that there is some support other than a flimsy plastic casing.  I don't imagine I'll leave my tablet lying around on benches, so I am not worried that I'll crack the screen at any point during my ownership.----------------------------------------UNBOXING----------------------------------------The tablet comes with a manual, AC adaptor, USB charger, microUSB-to-USB male-to-female adapter, and a \"specialized\" paperclip that will fit in the \"CTRL + ALT + DEL\" hole (a 'hard reset' pinhole is available on device in case the screen becomes unresponsive).  The USB charger is fairly short at a little over a yard, so you may want to pick up your own microUSB-to-USB cable.  The box itself is sealed with a specialized anti-tamper tape that will leave a 'lenovo' logo on the box if the tape is peeled to open the box.--------------------------------------PHYSICAL APPEARANCE--------------------------------------The tablet itself is a bit thinner in width than an iPhone 5.  While weighing in at less than 1.5 pounds, this tablet \"feels light as a feather\" when compared even to the netbooks of yester-year.  It's about 0.3 pounds lighter than my HP Touchpad and MUCH thinner.  To put it into perspective, it means that the Lenovo Lynx is 6 times as heavy as an iPhone 5, or 3 times as heavy as a Kindle Paperwhite.The top edge of the tablet has a power button with a charge indicator light next to it.  The light is a very small LED that glows orange during charging and white when it's fully charged.  It only glows when it's plugged into a power source.  There is a microphone array as well, one in the top middle and one towards the right side.  There is also a microSD slot which is covered.  The cover comes off easily if you use a paperclip to lift it; it's near impossible to pry it up with your fingernail.  The cover has a rubber tether that keeps it from fully detaching from the tablet, meaning that you won't lose it while you're inserting or removing an SD card.  The microSD slot is fairly deep inside, so you will need to use a paperclip to push it in.  It will click in, and if you press down again, it'll pop up but will not pop up far enough.  I found that I needed to use tweezers to pull out the microSD card since it wouldn't stick out past the inside lip of the housing.  There is also what appears to be a non-removable molded cover for another port, about the size of a nano-SIM card.  Perhaps international versions will allow 4G data connectivity through this port, but it is blocked off by plastic molding on my device.The right edge of the tablet has a microphone/headphone combo jack, the type that accepts the iPhone earbuds that has the line-in mic (three bands on the jack).  There is also a microHDMI port.  Both of these ports are uncovered.  There is also a slit for the right-side speaker port which is situated closer to the top of the device so that your hands won't block the speaker port if you're gripping the edge towards the middle/bottom.The bottom edge of the tablet has two docking slots and a microUSB port square in the middle.  The microUSB port is used for charging as well as the tethering of other devices.  The microUSB-to-USB dongle that came in the package can be plugged in here; I've successfully connected a 32GB USB flash drive and a USB dongle for a wireless mouse.  Since this port offers less than 1A of power, bigger devices such as full HDD or CD burners will not run off of this USB port.  However, if a powered USB hub is supplied, it will work without issues.  There is also a barcode and serial number sticker next to the microUSB port with markings that this device itself was manufactured on 12/11/2012.The left edge of the tablet has left-side speaker port to provide stereo sound.  There is a dedicated rotation lock button and a volume up/down rocker.  These buttons are nested in a bit so that it is not flush with the edge of the tablet, and it is hard to push them due to this fact.  As stated earlier, fingernails are needed to use the volume rocker.The front face of the tablet has one physical button.  It is a Windows button that can be used to wake the tablet up from sleep or bring you to the Windows 8 menu.  The button is nestled slightly in so that it's not flush with the face of the tablet.  There is a chrome \"Lenovo\" logo that is embedded in the bezel underneath the edge-to-edge glass.  Also embedded underneath the glass at the top of the bezel is the front-facing camera, a power LED and the ambient light sensor.  All three of these items are next to each other, with the camera in the top middle and the other two items to the right of it.  The power indicator is a very small green LED that flashes for half a second every time the power is turned on or off on the device.  The ambient light sensor cannot be seen during regular use since it's covered by tinted black glass.  However, if you shine a flashlight directly onto the glass (or put it in direct sunlight), you can see past the black tinting of the bezel and see a round hole with a green microchip of the ambient light sensor.  The edge-to-edge glass on the front is set slightly inside of the plastic casing of the tablet so that there is a barely noticeable ledge around the entire face.  The slab of glass is not oleophobic and easily attracts fingerprints and oils.The corners of the tablet are slightly rounded.  There is a clear seam that splits down the middle of the entire edge where the gray backing of the case is attached to the black plastic that holds the front glass face.  However, I cannot pry between the seam and it does not feel as though the device is structurally weak.  The back of the device is gray texturized hollow plastic.  There is a slight 'give' in the plastic if you push hard enough, but it's barely noticeable.  Holding it one handed will not push/bend the backing of the case.  The back plastic has three stickers; an Intel Atom sticker, a Windows 8 sticker and an FCC sticker.  Fingerprints or oils do not show up on the back plastic at all.----------------------------------------SPEAKERS, HEADPHONES AND MICROPHONES----------------------------------------The speakers on this tablet are truly stereo.  Listening to the opening score for the TV series \"Archer\" showcases that there is a stereo effect and it's quite easy to hear it.  In comparison to the one speaker port in the iPhone 5, one speaker port on the Lenovo Lynx will max out to about 80% of the speaker volume on the iPhone 5.  However, since there are two speaker ports, it can get louder than the iPhone 5 speaker.  It is multitudes louder than an iPod Touch 4th Gen. speaker.  I cannot get the device to distort sound even at 100%, although the entire tablet will vibrate if the speakers are turned up during loud music.  It's definitely loud enough to watch Netflix movies in bed even at 60% volume.Plugging in headphones will automatically cut the speakers and send sound to the headphones.  However, the device does not have different profiles for speaker volume and headphone volume; whatever volume level you have set will carry over whenever you plug/unplug headphones.  This is different than iOS or Android devices that will allow you to have your speaker volume set to a different levels than your headphone volume, and will auto-switch volume levels as you plug/unplug your headphones.  Headphones sound crystal clear.Testing the built-in microphone with Skype showed that unless you speak loudly or towards the top edge of the tablet, the microphone struggles to pick up your voice.  While holding the tablet two feet away from myself, the microphone picked up whisper-quiet voice levels from me while I spoke in an \"indoor\" voice.  However, I usually speak a bit louder when I chat on the phone, so trying a louder voice registered better with Skype, but the best result was actually to tilt the tablet's top edge towards me while I spoke.  This seemed a bit impractical.  I found that the audio mixer allowed me to \"boost\" the microphone sensitivity an extra 36dB.  However, it would start to pick up the pops and creaks from my handling of the tablet.When I used my V-Moda Vibe Duo earbuds with built-in mic, everything went MUCH better than expected.  The sound of my own voice was crisp, clear and loud.----------------------------------------CAMERA----------------------------------------While using the Windows 8 camera app, it allowed me several settings.  The still-image camera allowed resolutions of 0.3MP (4:3), 0.9PM (16:9), 1.2MP (4:3), and 2.1MP (16:9).  When I switched to Video mode, it allowed the resolutions of 252p (16:9), 360p (16:9), 480p (4:3), 540p (16:9), 720p (16:9) and 1080p (16:9).  Unfortunately, the picture quality is pretty grainy like any standard $20 webcam.  It is grainier than the iPhone front-facing camera.----------------------------------------AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR----------------------------------------Since this is a full-fledged version of Windows 8, power adjustment and screen adjustments are taken care of through the usual Power Options in Windows.  Lenovo does NOT run their own software on top of Windows, unlike Asus or Samsung.  That means that there are less errors and less issues.  The Ambient Light Sensor is embedded underneath the glass of the front-facing bezel.  It's pretty responsive; holding your thumb over the sensor will force the screen to dim within a second.  The dimming is gradual, rather than step-wise so that you see a nice fading in brightness.----------------------------------------OS & SOFTWARE----------------------------------------This is what it all comes down to.  The reason I want a tablet is because it is easy to carry with me, whether I'm knocking out e-mails at the coffee shop or watching movies in bed.  However, I needed a full-fledged operating system to run my suite of Microsoft Office, CodeBlocks, NetBeans, Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Cool Edit Pro, Acrobat Pro, Oralce Database, Filezilla, etc.  That was the limitation with iOS/Android: you can try to cobble several apps together and bridge their outputs to get your desired workflow, but it would always fall short.I'm glad to say that this tablet exceeds my expectations by leaps and bounds.  I owned a netbook several years ago and have had experience with the \"Intel Atom\" chipsets.  They are ungainly slow and netbooks back in the day had limitations of supporting only 1GB of RAM.  One of my major concerns was that these new hybrid tablets with Intel Atom are only meant to address 2GB of older DDR2 architecture RAM.  In a typical day, my home or work computer is usually tying up 6 to 7GB of RAM between its programs, with the Windows 7 OS taking about 1.5GB of it.  I'm happy to say that Windows 8 standard on this Lenovo Lynx tablet only uses 0.9GB, of which I can probably cut down to 0.7GB if I turn off some unneeded services.  Even after a full day of use, if I close all of my apps, it will go back down to 0.9GB of RAM usage by the OS.The tablet itself is delivered barebones.  Other than the OS, it only has a PDF editor, a trial edition of Microsoft Office 2010 and a trial edition of Norton Security.  Windows 8 now includes antivirus protection as part of the \"Windows Defender\" software that comes pre-installed with the OS, so I deleted the Norton security since it had too many processes and plug-ins associated with it.Since the tablet uses eMMC solid state drives rather than the standard SATA drives, writing to the drive is slower than laptops or desktops that have SATAIII SSD drives.  However, it is still noticeably faster than a 7200RPM HDD.  The eMMC solid state drive may not be as fast as consumer SSD drives, but it's read times are still faster than the traditional hard drives inside of laptops.After installing about 25 programs and configuring them, I was surprised by the start-up time.  During the first half-dozen restarts while the tablet was setting itself up and downloading updates, start-up times were about 1 minute and 30 seconds on average.  Fortunately, after running all of the updates and installing all of my apps/programs, the tablet does a cold boot in about 20 seconds!  That's perfectly acceptable to me since my quad-core Core i5 3570k over-clocked desktop at home takes about 15 seconds to boot up in Windows 7.  I'm extremely impressed with the boot-up time on this device.  Wake from sleep is, in fact, instant.  The OS is responsive the second you hit the \"Windows\" key to wake it up from sleep.Speaking of sleep, I am monitoring the device over my WiFi network.  I can see the tablet pop-up on my WiFi network every 5 minutes even when it's supposed to be asleep: it seems to wake itself up from sleep every 5 minutes to check for new e-mails and beeps to notify me (the screen does not turn on, but it will beep when new items come in).  I have apps such as Skype, GMail, Yahoo Mail to auto-refresh while the computer is locked and asleep.  When I wake the computer and look at the lock-screen, it gives me notifications about how many e-mails I have received, any calls that I have missed, etc.  This is a setting in Windows 8 that can be turned on/off.I have not found a day where I have run out of charge for this device.  I have used it on the road to surf the internet and answer some e-mails while tethered over Bluetooth to an access point.  After 3 hours of use in this manner, I had about 75% of battery left (the power plan is set to \"Balanced\" mode with the screen brightness about 3/4 of the way up).  I have used this device with the WiFi and Bluetooth on for about 5 hours while streaming Netflix, and it had about 45% battery life left at that point.  I've never let the battery run all the way down, but I wouldn't doubt the quoted 8+ hours of battery life.The tablet itself is extremely responsive and snappy.  When using the official Windows 8 apps that can be purchased from the Windows App store, the apps take the entire screen.  You never see the Windows desktop or the taskbar.  In this \"Metro UI\" or \"App\" mode, there are some nifty tricks that you can pull.  Rather than hitting the physical Windows button at bottom of the tablet, if you slide your thumb from the right bezel inwards, a menu pops up that gives you the option to run a search for programs/documents, go the Windows menu, or open settings.  If you slide your thumb in from the left bezel, you will cycle through Windows 8 apps and programs running in the background (same as the \"ALT + TAB\" shortcut on the keyboard).  If you slide your thumb in from the left bezel and immediately slide back out to the bezel, you can see a thumbnail preview of all of your running programs.  From there, you can drag a program to the left or right-side of the screen, and it will split your window so that you have two apps open in a 1:5 ratio.  The surprise here was that the Intel Atom Z2760 processor is strong enough to run two 720p YouTube videos simultaneously in that odd picture-in-picture type of way.  There was no noticeable lag or stutter; everything ran buttery smooth with one window in FireFox and the other in Internet Explorer.Just to give you some numbers, Adobe Photoshop CS6 takes about 15 second to launch.  Microsoft Office 2013 Word takes about 4 seconds to launch.  Memory management seemed to be fine.  For example, I was running Photoshop, Word, Excel, and 5 tabs in Internet Explorer and  everything was running fine with only 1.6GB of RAM taken.  After installing my suite of apps, 27GB of free space was still left on the internal storage.  I have found a method of storing my Dropbox files to the micro SD drive by formatting the micro SD as an NTFS drive and setting a mounting point in a folder of my creation on the C:\\ drive.  This was necessary since my Dropbox contains several gigabytes of data that I did not want to waste on the internal drive of the Lenovo Lynx, and the Dropbox app will not allow storage on a removable drive (so I had to trick the program).There is a Windows 8 app called \"Fresh Paint\" and I decided to try it out.  It allows drawing on the screen.  Since the Lenovo Lynx does not support a pressure-sensitive digitizer, it should only be able to see 5 finger gestures at once without being able to distinguish pressure sensitivity.  I found that the Lynx performed sub-bar in the Fresh Paint application.  If I picked a paintbrush and swiped across the screen, there would be a one-second delay before I saw the results.  The resulting swipe would show up a block at a time rather than being a fluid brush stroke.  The app was able to distinguish speed: a slow, deliberate drag would generate a solid ink line while a quick brush across would fade the brush stroke as it would on a real canvas.  However, the app was completely unusable due to the delay.  I wanted to open Photoshop and use the touchscreen to make a comparison, but Photoshop would not register the touchscreen as an input device.  Upon installing Skitch, I was able to draw freely and annotate my photographs without delay.  I would be inclined to conclude that perhaps input-heavy apps such as Fresh Paint may be the only apps that suffer from lag/delay from the Touchscreen as it is not optimized for this simple touchscreen.Speaking of the touchscreen, it is extremely responsive and accurate.  Even at full resolution, you can accurately click on a 9-point font link amidst a sea of links.  When you touch the screen or move your fingers around the screen, you are greeted with a 20% faded gray circle that encircles your finger to show you that your touches are registering.One of the biggest necessities with these tablets is a good on-screen keyboard.  Microsoft did a good job with Windows 8; apps in the Metro UI will automatically force the keyboard to pop-up as soon as you touch a text-input area.  Outside of the Metro UI or \"App\" mode, there is a giant keyboard icon on the Windows Taskbar that will pop up the keyboard when you need it.  They keyboard takes nearly half the screen (vertically).  Since I have been using touchscreen devices for nearly 6 years, and since this is an 11.6\" touchscreen, I can actually lay the device down on a surface and type at about 35 words per minute.  The keyboard has different settings as well, allowing you to use the regular keybaord, a split keyboard that allows you to type on half the keyboard using just your left thumb and the other half using your right thumb, or go into hand-write detection mode so you can use a stylus to write directly on the screen and allowing Windows to decipher your writing.  As another input method, speech recognition is built-in to Windows 8.  However, it was near impossible to get it to work, due to the weak microphone.Some apps do not seem to cope well with the pop-up keyboard.  Windows tries to adjust your working screen by shoving your program's text input box above the keyboard that slides out from the bottom of the screen.  In the desktop version of FireFox or Internet Explorer, it means that the web browser would redraw the area to fit the textbox above the keyboard.  However, Google Chrome was a disaster.  Instead of redrawing the HTML elements, Chrome would attempt to resize its entire window to make it take space on the top-half of the touchscreen.  When you hit the keyboard button to hide the large touchscreen keyboard, Google Chrome often failed to go back to full-screen so you end up with a browser that fills only the top half of the screen.  On more than half the occasions, Chrome would just crash after a keyboard input.  So I ended up using Internet Explorer as my main browser.  However, there are two versions of Internet Explorer; the Metro UI touchscreen version and the regular desktop version that comes with all Windows computers.  The touchscreen-specific IE is easier to navigate since all of the buttons are huge, and menu items slide in from the top and bottom in large icons.  The performance is also better than the desktop/regular version of IE, so I would recommend using this \"App\" version of Internet Explorer.As mentioned earlier, I tether my Lenovo Lynx tablet to my iPhone via Bluetooth to share a 4G connection while I am on the road.  Unfortunately, starting with Windows 8, Microsoft has removed connectivity to ad-hoc WiFi networks.  The usual method of creating a WiFi hotspot will no longer allow you to connect to a shared Internet connection.  Ad-hoc networks even fail to show up in the Windows WiFi configuration window.  However, if you can create an ad-hoc connection via Bluetooth, this tablet will allow you to choose a \"Shared Network\" option via Bluetooth to tether to your cell phone's data plan.  It also didn't have issues connecting with devices to stream audio via Bluetooth.----------------------------------------PROS----------------------------------------I'll finally list the \"Pros\" of owning this tablet:*Extremely light compared to carrying a full-fledged laptop, yet can run the same 32-bit applications as any laptop.  Lighter than an iPad with 3G chip.*Very bright and crisp screen.  Noticeably brighter than the Asus VivoTab Smart and easily useable in direct sunlight (minus the reflection due to the glass screen).*No proprietary drivers or necessary accompanying software.  Unlike Samsung or Asus tablets, you can upgrade this device to a full Windows 8 Pro or wipe it clean and install an operating system of your choice because it is not dependent on manufacturer-specific applications.*11.6\" diagonal screen adds so much more screen real estate than a 9 or 10\" screen that you can type on the on-screen keyboard without issues.  Keyboard is responsive without any issues or mis-alignment.----------------------------------------REFERENCES----------------------------------------CPUBenchmark has raw PassMark scores that show that the Atom Z2760 actually beats an Intel Core 2 Duo T5270 processor.  AnandTech has a fantastic write-up about the Atom processor itself and a benchmark comparison in a dozen categories that show it out-performing the nVidia Tegra 3 Quad-Core processor.----------------------------------------NOTES----------------------------------------I have not purchased the dockable keyboard for this device.  I will hold out for a price drop since I mainly purchased this device to use in \"tablet\" mode.  I will post any updates at the top of this review in a section marked \"UPDATES\" if necessary.----------------------------------------UPDATES----------------------------------------03/18/20131) Certain games, such as Microsoft Mahjong, will run the memory up to 1.9GB used.  At that point, a warning pane will pop open on the desktop stating that the system is \"running out of memory\".  This pop-up will not disrupt your open apps and you will only see it once you close your app and go to the desktop.  However, I did not experience any issues during game play.  I played Mahjong for about 4 hours straight before I closed the app, only to notice that pop-up warning message.  2GB of RAM may be troublesome for some people.2) Although I initially wrote that the desktop version of Internet Explorer was my preferred browser, I have found that having 2 or more Flash-heavy websites will make the browser freeze for a few seconds upon loading.  The Metro UI \"App\" version of Internet Explorer does not have this issue.  I have edited my review to state that I prefer the \"App\" version of the browser.", "Title": "Full Detailed Review", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "orandy", "ReviewID": "R36KK78PO1SI2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picked it up from Best Buy today. I also ordered my keyboard dock from Amazon today as well.I admit, I was a little skeptical at first, it being a Windows tablet and all, but I did want MS Office to do some work on. I have been running Win 8 in a virtual machine for a few months, so I know my way around the OS.First thing I did was update the Win 8 basic OS to Windows 8 Pro. I picked up a license back in October when it was only 40-bucks. Glad I did.The update went smoothly and I then installed Apple Airport software to give me access to my file server that's hooked up to my router. Without having a disc drive, having access to all my Windows applications was a must.Then I ran Windows update and grabbed the latest patches and fixes, before I installed Office 2007.Got Chrome installed and now I'm off to the races.This machine has really impressed me thus far. The only hiccup I've experienced is the Bluetooth. It recognized my keyboard and mouse, but the Magic Mouse kept cutting in and out. Then I ran out and got a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse. Bluetooth crashed again and I was beginning to have my doubts. I guess an update kicked in because I am no longer having problems. My Apple Bluetooth keyboard that I bought to use with my iPad works just fine... and the new mouse is great.This should hold me until my keyboard dock arrives.As far as looks go, this thing is beautiful. I never thought I would say this, but it is lighter than my iPad 3, only with a slightly larger screen. The screen is great. Not as sharp as the iPad HD but it is better than the one on the iPad 2.This machine won't break any speed records, but it gets the job done, installing all my legacy Windows applications, exactly what it was intended for.I haven't had one single system crash.  It came loaded with only one major bloatware app, Norton. I wound up using Norton's tool to get rid of that. Now I just have Security Essentials installed.I highly recommend this machine, if you want legacy Windows support in a tablet form factor with great battery life. You won't be playing high end games or breaking speed records, but that is not the use case of this machine. What it does it does well. It had the best reviews of any Lenovo tablet and that should tell you something... they really got this one right.This is the Windows tablet to beat. If you're on the fence, don't be. Pick this one up and it won't disappoint.________________________________________________________________________Update (After Setup)I highly recommend putting Win 8 Pro on this machine, I have yet to be disappointed. Initially I installed Office 2007. Then I realized my wife has a special program with her company that allows us to download Office 2013 Pro for only 10 bucks; and it can be used on multiple machines.Using Office 2013 in Win 8 on my Idealtab Lynx is very slick. The applications load fast and just seem more integrated than Office 2007. If all you have is an older version of Office, go for it, I understand. However, if you can shell out some extra cash for Office 2013 (even if you just buy Word and/or Outlook separately), do it!If you're new to Windows 8 altogether, even though there are free alternatives to bring back the Start-Button, shell out the 5-bucks and get Start8. It's a terrific program to bring back the Start-Button for Windows 8, and at only 5-bucks it's a steal. Also, once you buy it, all you have to do is log into your account to install it on other Win 8 machines... just can't beat that.Also, make sure you go into settings (via the Charms bar) and turn off the setting that allows Windows to manage screen brightness. It is very annoying until you do this. This screen is bright and very readable, but with Windows messing around with it, it bounces back from dark to light and is extremely unnerving.Another thing everyone should do to free up a couple extra gigs... is to delete all the Windows 8 Metro apps you don't need (which, by the way, will probably be mostly ALL of them).I literally have not touched my iPad since I started using this amazing device. It's really hard to convey. Just imagine you have a very powerful PC that is the screen size of a Net-book but is as light as an iPad.I stay in Desktop mode, but I have downloaded a few news and tech-news Metro apps.I only buy Lenovo for Windows hardware and I highly recommend you do the same. If you're thinking about a Surface or some other device, consider this. In 2013, 3 or 4 hours of battery life for a mobile device just isn't going to cut it. Also, if a device weighs more than a pound and a half, you will feel it, because the iPad has us spoiled : )Even so, if your use case is gaming or serious photo editing, then you need a tablet with the Core i5 or i7, plus 4 to 8-GIGS of RAM (8 is currently not available on tablets), and a discrete GPU as well (non-existent on a tablet by the way). When you're all said and done, that describes specs for a decent desktop or high-end laptop anyway.Future iterations of Intel processors will most likely be able to accommodate these use cases in the near future, but not right now. I'm lucky, because I don't game outside of light iOS apps, and I don't require heavy duty photo editing, so the Ideatab Lynx is a stellar mobile computer for me. I sincerely hope my review helps you in your decision.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Update: After using the tablet with the keyboard dock.I've been using the tablet for several days now and everything is great. I just got my keyboard dock last night and I love it. When I hooked my tablet to my keyboard, however, my Bluetooth MS mouse went crazy so I had to turn it off and put it away. That's okay though, because I have a USB mouse that I can plug into my new keyboard. I also prefer the reliability of a USB mouse over Bluetooth or WIFI. The touchpad is not as bad as everyone was complaining about either. I recommend you use some type of mouse when docked via keyboard, but if you forgot your mouse at home, the trackpad will more than suffice in a tight pinch.Portable USB drives work great with the keyboard dock. I'm sure it will have no problem with Windows supported disc drives and other USB peripherals. Unfortunately, my Apple Superdrive didn't work with my keyboard. That was no surprise, because I had already found in my earlier research that in order to get the Superdrive to work in Windows, it requires a laborious hardware and software hack.I had read the reviews on this keyboard and most of them weren't that great. I'm glad I decided to get it anyway, because it works just fine. Some complained that the keyboard did not keep up with their typing. I type about 60-wpm and it has not missed a single stroke.Lenovo makes great keyboards and this one is no exception. Is it the best keyboard they ever made? Absolutely not. But it performs more than just good enough and it is fully integrated with the tablet, adding extra battery life to boot.All in all I'm quite happy with my new computer/tablet/laptop.", "Title": "This is a cool little computer : )", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Rock Enthusiast", "ReviewID": "RSD1QSTWJIIOM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Avoid Lenovo's supplied Windows 8.1 drivers from their support site like the plague!  Lenovo clearly has quality control issues on the hardware side, AND on the software side.  My unit came with a beat up mainboard, which gave me very poor wifi connectivity.  After that issue was handled through their RMA process, I still had to deal with Lenovo's lack of support in terms of working drivers for Windows 8.1, since the ones supplied in their own website left you with a very unstable system.  Lenovo can't say that they didn't claim their product cannot run Windows 8.1, when they supplied drivers for it in their website.  The problem is these drivers supplied by Lenovo are trash.I'm pleased to say, FINALLY, as of Mid-November 2013, Intel has given us a working video driver for Windows 8.1 to use with the Lynx.  The dreaded \"display driver stopped responding and has recovered\" nonsense has been fixed with the release of the 9.14.3.1177 driver.  The driver is found as an optional install in Windows Update.I can now confidently say this model is ready to run with Windows 8.1 in a stable manner.Apparently, this driver issue affected an entire category of tablets that ran with Clover Trail cpus, and it took community pressure to get Intel off their butts, and look at the problem to produce a real fix, contrary to what Lenovo supplied in their website.  The linked thread speaks of an 1176 driver, but today, you'll find the 1177 driver for the Lynx when you run Windows Update.  The initial frustration had to do with responses from Lenovo, Intel, and Microsoft, where you found yourself being bounced, around because nobody had a real fix.  Thankfully, Intel stepped up.Now, with all those problems dealt with, (and hopefully fixed in the long run with no regression) here's my current review of the product, post Windows 8.1:First, to update the system to 8.1, update Windows 8.0 to its fullest (and I mean everything Microsoft spits out through automatic updates), without installing any of Lenovo's drivers supplied in their website.  Then install Windows 8.1 from the Windows Appstore.  After that's complete, make sure you check your video driver is running with 1177, if not, look in Windows Updates in the \"optional\" section.  After all that's done, this updated review applies to THAT final product.Materials:On the outside, the tablet is built with creaky plastic, and is a delicate unit to say the least.  The dock is just as cheap feeling.  Even though it's plastic, the Lynx mostly remains cool to the touch because of the low tdp atom clover trail cpu that requires no active cooling.  Oddly, you can't say clover trail is cool across all models; the Acer Iconia W510 gets hot for some reason.Physical Dimensions:As a tablet, it's made for landscape usage.  First impression is it's very light, and very wide.  I understand now what Apple was alluding to when it comes to a \"perfect size\" for both orientations, when designing the iPad.  Being such a wide display, holding it portrait-style feels top heavy, and the buttons and web camera are situated such that they favor landscape orientation.  Windows 8.1 as a user interface, also favors landscape, since \"side-by-side\" multitasking works best in that scenario.  The Lynx meets the absolute minimum desktop resolution specification (1366x768) to allow for two side by side \"Modern UI\" apps to display, even though Windows 8.1 the operating system can potentially do more than 2.  Because of the rather large size of this elongated tablet, two-handed touch typing is VERY effective in landscape, perhaps sitting on the lap, or on a table.  The soft keyboard is very well done in Windows, and really makes proper use of wide and spacious screen real estate that the Lynx gives you.  Asian users will love the built-in handwriting recognition in Windows 8.  Two-finger typing in portrait orientation on the other hand, feels like a stretch on your thumbs, even across various soft-key layouts available.  As-is, landscape typing on this produces around 40 wpm coming from a 80-100 wpm typist.  If there's any indication that using touch devices exclusively reduces productivity, this one is indisputable.  I'm glad this comes with a physical docking keyboard for this reason, but at the same time don't appreciate that you have to buy it separately.Software:It comes with very little bloatware or trialware, which Lenovo is very good about, but there's still a few you'll likely want to uninstall at your discretion.  I personally have no use for Lenovo's pre-installed cloud storage options (I use Skydrive and Dropbox for that), nor the IntelAppup store, preinstalled Norton software, trial version of NitroPDF, etc.  It does NOT come with Office 2013.  It includes a TRIAL copy of Office pre-installed.  Windows 8 had issues including files in \"libraries\" when sourced from \"removable media\" like microsd card, which was a horrible oversight for tablets, but this was fixed in 8.1  Because of this fix, now your files can be immediately found in the pre-installed \"Photos\", \"Music\", and \"Videos\" modern ui apps without usability issues, which can't be said for 8.0.  You'll want to re-enable viewing files libraries in folder settings from the control panel, because for some reason, Libraries aren't viewable by default in 8.1.  The Lynx can run traditional desktop apps quite well, but take it easy on heavier applications.  It is after all, only a dual-core 1.8ghz atom laptop with 2GB DDR2 ram when it comes to specs, so use it accordingly.  You'll run MS Office 2013 just fine on it, if that's your intention.  As for the Windows Appstore, it's lacking in number of available apps when compared to what's available in Android and iOS appstores.  This is NOT a gaming machine, but you'll be able to run light weight casual games in the appstore no problem.  You get full-blown Windows here, not a mobile OS, and definitely more options for software, because in reality, in addition to what's available in the Modern UI appstore, you have legacy desktop applications, and potentially even emulated android apps via \"Bluestacks\", although I find Android emulation to be buggy and horribly slow at best on the Lynx.  Windows 8.1 comes with real browsing capability; you aren't tied down to a less usable mobile browser.  What does that mean?  Things like Hulu work on the browser, and you aren't required to have a Hulu Plus account to run a Hulu Plus \"app\".  I also appreciate not having to scroll up to the url bar in the browser, when a bottom edge swipe gesture brings it up when needed.  As for mobile apps, all the regulars I suppose are represented, but that doesn't mean much when other appstores have an overwhelmingly larger catalogue.  Facebook requires Windows 8.1 to be installed though.  It's good enough for general consumption device, but not best, although I really like how clean some of the pre-installed Modern UI apps are in 8.1, like Microsoft's News, Sports, Food, and Health apps.  It's a fun diversion from work work work, which of course is the main reason businesses don't want Modern UI being so prominent.  As for multimedia, you'll want to install VLC media player, since the preinstalled Videos app doesn't handle all internal codecs you will likely come across.  The updated Music app is actually very well implemented as a free streaming service, and as a localized player.  All of this is made usable because of how Windows 8.1 allows files to be sourced from removable media.  Now that it's stable, 8.1 is now a must-have update for the Lynx.  Personally, if you plan on running customized enterprise software, stick with Windows 7 devices, as that is better supported by current IT departments.Multitasking and Application Launching:It's Windows.  Multitasking is at the heart of their design for tablet and desktop applications, unlike Android and iOS, where they are advertising it as a nice \"feature\" in certain models.  Switching Modern UI apps is with a swipe on the left edge, there's also the side-by-side snapping layouts, and desktop multitasking is as found in Windows 7.  Altogether, Windows handles multitasking better than iOS and Android.  On the desktop, although there's no \"Start Menu\", Windows 8.1's \"Start Screen\" attempts to mitigate issues with too many tiles with \"small\" tiles, and the zoom-out gesture from 8.0.  Think of the \"start screen\" as a singular android \"workspace\", that in Windows 8.1, there is no need for multiple workspaces.  Microsoft's intentions are clear, in that the new start button is merely a link to the start screen.  The start menu, and its nested menus are gone, and perhaps for the better, because digging through menus is slow, and I'm personally tired of explaining to very new users that if a shortcut isn't already on your desktop, \"Microsoft Word is found in a nested menu called Microsoft Office in the start menu.\"  People naturally respond more to launchers than menus in my experience.  If you're a diehard desktop purist who wants to avoid the start screen, you can now boot to the desktop if that is what you want, and you can still make your own shortcuts on the desktop and launch bar.  Personally, I never needed the start menu in Windows 7, since I had everything arranged a certain way on the launch bar and desktop, and I have a strict logic to where I put my important documents.  I'm not the type to forget where my files are, and I like how the File Manager Icon supports jump lists, which was a nice feature carried over from Windows 7.Overall, the start screen and \"all apps\" screen, is a better package than the old start menu.  Unfortunately however, you can't create a shortcut for Modern UI apps on the windows desktop, to really unify everything.  Really, all these options and forced separation creates a dual device scenario that people either love or hate about Windows 8.1.  For me, what's not to like, when I'm pretty much getting two distinct devices in one physical space, and the user interface is predictable enough.  I love convergence when it makes sense, and it makes sense when used as a large netbook or a tablet, depending on what the scenario calls for.  It's one less gizmo to be carrying around.The Docking Keyboard:The dock sucks.  The keyboard is mushy soft, the touchpad overly sensitive, and inaccurate.  You're better off with a mouse if using as a laptop.  The keyboard itself misses keystrokes if you're a particularly fast typist like myself.  I have to slow down the keystrokes with this.  The touchpad has tactile ambiguity with the surrounding base, such that your finger can sometimes steer out of the box and you wouldn't even know it.  The left and right mouse buttons on the pad cannot be used with a thumb because the way they are anchored as a single piece, and because of their small size, you will most likely run into trouble with very basic actions like dragging files to other folders with one hand like you can do with a usable touchpad.  The lack of multitouch gestures is also glaring, but worse still is the lack of vertical scrolling.  Really, why include a touchpad with no vertical scroll of any kind?  The one saving grace is the two full size usb ports on the dock, and just having an extended battery, but that's only part of the story...Battery Life:It's as advertised for the TABLET, but NOT FOR THE DOCKING KEYBOARD!  The tablet lasts 6-8 hours for sure, depending on the task.  The dock's extended battery lasts 2 hours maybe.  You're pretty much charging a battery with a battery, and that alone means the extended battery won't last long when there are no intelligent exceptions as to WHEN the battery should charge the other one.  As a result, for maximum battery life per charge, I leave my unit plugged into an outlet when used as a laptop, and run it unplugged as a laptop only when absolutely necessary.  When plugged in, the tablet side is charged first, and when that is 100%, the secondary gets charged.  Using as a tablet is of course unplugged.  Docking the tablet when both batteries are fully charged is just waste of battery on the secondary when unplugged.  The charging cable that is packaged with the unit is laughably short.  Get a longer microusb-usb cable of your own, and make sure it carries the charge correctly, since my initial third party cable, although nice and long, charged the device multitudes slower than the one Lenovo gives you. Using the tablet in this manner will land you close to the advertised battery life, depending heavily on how well you maneuver with poor power (management) of the Lynx.  Frankly, it's an all-day device, with stipulations.  One way to waste battery is docking the tablet when both, the primary and secondary batteries are at a 100 percent, unplugging it, then leaving it docked when the secondary is all out of juice in about 2 hours.  The dock is effectively a power drain at that point, and you won't come near the advertised total battery life per charge if you leave it leeching away, especially if you've got usb peripherals attached.  Needless to say, the way in which this unit (manages) power is pretty poor, and this discourages the user from using the dock for extended periods of time without keeping it plugged in.Additional Ports:The tablet has a single MicroUSB, MicroHDMI, and MicroSD slot.  Aside from the compatibility with desktop applications, using USB devices and peripherals was a pretty compelling part of my decision to run with a Windows 8 tablet.  There's just no compromises to be made in that category.  It works with every USB portable hard drive I've attached it to.  Be aware however, that not all tablets with USB ports have the amps necessary to power your devices (portable drives in particular), which thankfully isn't the case with the Lynx.  It \"extends\" the display perfectly with my TV (in 1366x768) using MicroHDMI, but \"mirrors\" in a letter-boxed view because of the differing resolutions between the two displays. It connects to printers like you'd expect Windows to, it works with USB game controllers... There's not much thought involved when trying to use existing hardware with this tablet.  The dock itself has 2 full-sized usb 2 ports.  When docked, the system only has 2 available usbs, since the microusb is used for docking the keyboard.  I'm a light gamer, and so connecting the tablet laptop to my TV and playing Silent Hill 2 with a usb controller like a console was an impressive feat.  The Lynx really does have that \"complete package\" feel to it, but it simply lacks in performance and quality control to be honest.Conclusion:Overall, it's a unit with great amount of usage scenarios, but poor quality control and execution.  The current price is a little more representative of an atom laptop, and is now a pretty damn good deal.  I bought this a while back and waited a long time before I had a truly usable device, due to poor hardware manufacturing, and poor driver support from Lenovo.  I don't appreciate being a guinea pig for a few months.  Ultimately, with the driver fix and replaced hardware, I finally ended up with a device I'm quite happy with.  Will I recommend Lenovo convertible / hybrid tablets to my friends after this experience?  Heck no, especially because there are other models out there with perhaps better manufacturing, and better driver support.  We Lynx users had to wait for Intel and Microsoft to pick up where Lenovo left us hanging with their crappy 8.1 drivers provided in their website.  Coupled with my original unit's hardware issues out of the box, this experience was far from what I had with their Thinkpad business laptops.  For that reason, it's still a 3-star device in my opinion, despite the final product being better than 3 stars, 3.5 at the most, because we're still talking about a low spec device that I paid 500 bucks for in May.  I was paying for the usage scenarios, not brute performance, which custom-built desktops are still king when it comes to cost-performance.", "Title": "Honest Detailed Review", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "ifthecar", "ReviewID": "R20M5RU02JR4DW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "II finally found the perfect tablet that allows me to run all windows apps yet light enough to carry and use all day.Pros:* weighs only 1.4 lbs.

It is great to carry into meeting and the on-screen keyboard is also very good to type away notes or minutes.  I also purchased Office 2013 and is amazing with the tablet.  It took me a 2 months but now understand when to use the window 8 and the desktop for specific apps.The cons I mentioned above I have been able to reduce.  For example, the keyboard touchpad is almost useless due to how sensitive and would move when I typed.  I just disabled it and started using the touchscreen for all my pointing needs.  I then purchased a Bluetooth mouse in case I needed to use a more accurate pointing device.  However, I realized the touchscreen is WAY faster than the mouse and I don't even use the mouse anymore.  Only issue is copy and pasting on older applications.  However, on Office 2013 touch is so much better than using the mouse.Even though the physical keyboard feels responsive, the application misses some of the letters I type.

I really don't like Apple and I'm glad to be rid of the restrictive iOS.The Lynx is a very plain looking tablet. Feels a bit cheap, but still solid. It looks a little odd being as large as it is, but I often use my tablet in portrait mode for chord charts while gigging, so it's perfect for me.

Not a single lockup other than a few bad Ms store apps. Boots in seconds, shuts down in seconds. On first use, spent 7 hours using it: combination of loading apps from a WD laptop Ext drive using the Lynx's power, patching, and playing. Ran battery down to 26%.

If you do a little reading beforehand this does not become an issue or an expectation.As for the TABLET itself (no I will not be reviewing the keyboard attachment, I already know it sucks and I did not want it because I already have a laptop), it is a wonderful machine. I have bought two Samsung galaxy tab 2's and one Nexus and can easily say this is better than both. The larger screen is much easier to see and I actually enjoy the fact that it has physical home/volume buttons. In my opinion, touch-sensitive buttons lead to more mistakes because you can accidentally hit them while adjusting your grip on the device (happens to me ALOT on my Nokia Lumia phone). It's also extremely lightweight for it's size and the screen is crisp and bright. As for the plastic backing? I have no clue why this is an issue to some, it feels good to me and contributes to a less weighty device.

At the time of this edit, the Lynx is about $420 and the Tablet 2 is about $600, so the comment below about the Tablet 2 being only slightly more expensive than the Lynx no longer applies.However, after having the Tablet 2 for over a month, I have no regrets about choosing it over the Lynx. The Thinkpad Tablet 2 is a much better computer.------------First, I have no issues with the Windows 8 interface, and so I'm not assessing the product based on the software. Win8 works for me, and I actually like it. This review is of the IdeaTab Lynx itself.-------------Build Quality: I put this first, because this is where I had the most issues with this tablet.For the price, I wasn't expecting it to be very impressive, and it wasn't. The build is all plastic, allowing it to be pretty light, but that also made it flimsy. My tablet had a broken tab (required to hold the back on) when it got to me. I took a look at it, and it wasn't really surprising that it broke -- the tabs are thin and plastic and they'll break sooner or later. The back feels cheap, and it is slightly flexible. If you put this into a backpack with any books, you're going to break it eventually.Processor, memory, etc.: These are all fine, as long as you're aware that you're getting an Atom-based system. It isn't going to break any speed records, but it will be fine for most purposes.Screen: It is nice and big. This allows you to use some of the desktop programs with little issue. The downside of this is that the large size coupled with low resolution leads to a substandard visual experience. Pixels are easily visible, and text is choppy. I didn't mind this as much after a while, but it was a bit of a disappointment. The large screen comes with one major disadvantage --- this isn't nearly as portable as you might want.-------------Still, for the price, this is a decent tablet. The fact that you have a real operating system instead of the iOS/Android/WinRT type system means that you'll be able to run some real useful programs, if you need them. This will probably never replace your regular laptop, but if you have access to a computer at work, then this will be all you'll need at home.However, the flimsy build makes this a real gamble. I think that this tablet will break sooner or later. Mine was broken out of the box, but even if it wasn't, it wouldn't last long under regular use.------------Final verdict: If you're in the market for an Atom-based Win 8 tab, skip this one and get the Thinkpad Tablet 2. It's only a few dollars more on Amazon, and it's worth the money to get the better build, better screen resolution, portability, etc.", "Title": "Works, but has build issues", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Scott Morris", "ReviewID": "R7643FY49OK1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a firm believer that expectations are everything when it comes to a product's rating.  I love this tablet, but I made sure to read up on various reviews (both good and bad) so that I knew what to expect.  So here's what I've found:1. I was excited about the prospect of a laptop-style dock, but read several reviews that said that it was more hassle than it was worth, so I opted for a nice case (B00C8T7E0K and a separate Bluetooth mouse and keyboard2 There is a known issue with this tablet that can cause issues with your WiFi signal when using Bluetooth devices.  Apparently the WiFi and Bluetooth radio chips are one and the same and multiple BT devices tend to cause a bottleneck and make your WiFI signal weak or drop.  To get around this, I turned off the built-in Bluetooth and connect a Bluetooth dongle via the USB port only when I need the keyboard / mouse.3. This device is built to be light and have a LOONG battery life.  So far, it's excelled at both.  Know that to get these two things, you will need to trade off computing power.  I often have to close tabs or programs that I would otherwise keep open on a laptop to keep it from complaining about running low on memory.4.

I have had none of the negative experiences other users have had, but this tablet may not be for those with little to no tech experience. This tablet has taken considerable tweeking to make it work just right. The tablet needed just the right drivers to be loaded, Bluetooth and display in particular. It is very light and I love the size which is a plus. It originally gave me out of memory warnings but this problem  was overcome by adding virtual memory. I am very happy with the keyboard. It has a little flex but not enough to be a problem and I have had no problem with keystrokes not registering as some have reported. I have now upgraded to windows 8.1 with no problems and faster everything. I absolutely love windows 8 after getting used to it. I have it also on a desktop and a laptop.  Now the bad.

So it won't have any of the fun apps as in Android or Apple phones (like Facebook, instagram CandyCrush, you name it). But then again, you have the desktop version of the internet. So it is pretty useful. It offers the performance of a computer, with the mobility of a phone. It has a micro-USB port, and Micro-SD-Card port for extra storage space (e.g. music, photos, downloads).2) Typing could be an issue: If you type really fast, you might find yourself in frustration with the On-screen-keyboard. For example, when typing spacebar between words, it reads it as the character \"n\"  It's better off to get a Bluetooth Keyboard, some are really inexpensive in comparison to the official (although it provides some \"cover\" at the same time, and regular USB ports). I'm not paying that much money when I can get some nice bluetooth keyboard with the mouse pad integrated and for much less.3) Wait time: Even though the difference is in a few seconds, if you are impatient with the clicks, I recommend you moving to a higher ranking tablet. With a 1.8 GHz, the tablet gets it done, but it takes a while. Also, it is impossible to tell if you have \"clicked\" a button (and it confuses me because it takes a while to load the next page). You can solve this issue with a Bluetooth Keyboard that has a mouse pad, this way you can confirm you have actually click it. Also, left and right clicks will go much faster this way (you  won't have to click and hold on the screen to make a right click to open the options). The one I got allows me to use the keyboard shortcuts same as a regular windows pc.  Aside from that, wait time is fast enough for me. Edit: Since this is treated like a computer, I got an antivirus for it. If you do so, you must be careful with the processor, CPU, and RAM and all that. Meaning that you should turn on and off your antivirus when having multiple programs open. If you don't you will receive a warning window pop-up: \"Memory is low\" and you will start realizing it is painfully slow and you might have to force shut down. When having the antivirus on and using only the internet, I have no problem with the low memory issue.4) Charging time takes a while, may be about 8-12 hrs to make the LED go from orange to white (completely charged). (Edit) When Charging, make sure its off, for when is shut down charging takes much less time. My Tablet in particular discharges if I'm using it while at the same time I have it plugged into the wall. Ironic right? And it also gets hot. So just charge it when off (and this applies to phones, and many other electronics).  The brightness of the screen will make a huge difference with the battery life. For me being a college student, it really pays off to have this tablet since it lasts me for my 14 hrs of periodic use, and now I don't have to carry my heavy laptop, and my heavy books. And only  have to charge it when going to sleep. Don't expose it to the sun because it will make the screen yellowish (or at least it does for the screen protector, which is not provided).5) Don't use the power button to wake up the tablet. As I said before, it takes some extra seconds to respond, and if you press the power button twice in a row, you will make it go \"Force Shut down\" and you might have the so called \"BlueScreen of Death.\" So to avoid the inconvenience of rebooting (or even cleaning all data for restore). Instead use the only button it has (the windows 8 button) to turn the display on. And use the power button to turn the display off. Getting accustomed to this habit will prevent you from lost of data (and time).6) Make use of the Mini-Sd card port. It has around 28GB of actual space, and i have a 64Gb mini sd card.

Yes, it's plastic and therefore plasticity, but it feels firm enough to me. I'm willing to sacrifice ultra firmness (like on the iPad) for something as light as this.The screen is bigger than the biggest iPad, which my wife has, but i can hold and read a digital magazine on the Lynx in portrait mode with one hand and not feel the strain like I do with the iPad.That being said, the screen IS an awkward size: in portrait mode, the magazines don't take up the full screen, leaving empty black space at the top and bottom.I put in a 64gb micro SDXC card the other day, and it works fine.I used it in class the other day and connected the micro HDMI to a VGA convertor and hooked it up to a projector and it worked great.

I imagine that this tablet will be phased out shortly and replaced by newer versions based on the availability across multiple sites. But if you can get this tablet for under 4 bills you are getting great value.PerformanceThe ideatab boots up quick every time. It plays videos without issues. I haven't tried a lot of HD material but it seems to work fine. Menus/interface/UI is snappy. I was hesitant with the atom processors not generating enough horsepower but incredibly it surpassed my expectations.Battery LifeThis is up in the air. If I am using it heavily -- videos, games, youtube, and on a constant basis, it would last a day max. Otherwise, light or moderate use would get two days I think.Build QualityIt's solid overall. Some people said the back felt cheap, but who cares really. It's the back of the tablet. And honestly, it might feel a little cheap but its not really noticeable. The buttons on the side (volume and orientation lock) are kinda loose and recessed so its hard to figure out what you are pressing. Many times I hit the wrong button and have to feel or look at what I am trying to press. It's not a major issue in my opinion. Screen looks good and is flushed pretty well with the border. Connection ports are standard, I don't see any issues with them. Home button at bottom is really nice and its a physical \"click\". I like that it's a button needed to be depressed rather than a tactile one (not sure the correct terms).MiscellaneousOk, so IE metro version works good when browsing. Although, at times websites lock up. It might be a combination of sleeping and waking back up to re-display the content, but I'm not sure. I like the IE metro because when you click a form field, the keyboard automatically pops up. Whereas, Firefox or Chrome you need to make a separate click to bring up the keyboard, and when done, make another click to drop the keyboard off screen. It's not intuitive. I can't wait for other browsers like Firefox to make a comparable browser to IE metro. I tried Firefox Nightly and it didn't work, or if it did work it wasn't intuitive like IE metro.I think the description might say \"mini hdmi\" but its actually \"micro hdmi\" port. Thanks Amazon. I purchased a $5 cable that is incompatible and not worth my time returning. Anyways, make sure you get micro hdmi if you want to stream to a TV or another monitor. Speaking of streaming...I think there might be a software limitation on how things display. So when I first hooked up my micro hdmi adapter to my TV, it was full screen (both on tablet and TV). As soon as I clicked on Video app on home screen, it made me switch resolutions. Ever since then its locked my resolution. The only way I can get it back full screen is extend display and blackout the tablet screen. This forces the user to blindly click a blacked out screen, or in my solution, to connect a wireless mouse using the usb adapter that came in the box. Really annoying since this is one of the things I wanted to use the tablet for, to stream videos and things to my big TV.

Once I decided to get a tablet I researched for days. I absolutely had to have something I wasn't going to hate. I checked benchmark results on the Intel Atom Z2760. It was pretty much the only CPU available in my price range. At first, I was skeptical because in terms of processing power it was dwarfed by a 5 year old i7 CPU. But paired with Windows 8, this tablet easily out performs the Windows 7 desktop PC during everyday computing.I'm simply blown away at how smooth and agile the system runs on W8. Apps are intuitive and helpful, live tiles are something I'm getting used to, but the real magic is in the capability to run full PC applications. I installed Office 2010 and this tablet makes quick work of starting any program in the suite. Excel, word, access, outlook, publisher and power point all start up in under 2 seconds.

I haven't been able to figure out why. I bought this tablet used on eBay and got an old cell phone charger included. So I have no information on the OEM charger.Takes a very long time to charge to 100%. Again, I haven't used the OEM charger, but after three weeks of owning this tablet I still haven't gotten it fully charged even after charging all night.In conclusion, if you can afford this tablet and you want something that can run everything with great capabilities, then buy this tablet. You can stop researching here at this review. I promise you won't be disappointed. Rather, you'll be pretty well blown away. Remember W8 was designed for touch screen. Here on a tablet, its power really shines.Now go buy it!P.S. Get a case. ALL tablets need a case. I read another review about the flimsy feeling of this tablet and disagreed.

It even loses reception completely (can't even find the WiFi) when you use Bluetooth. I'm serious here, its terrible.Support is none existent, Lenovo posted new drivers after windows 8.1 release which unwound describe as a bunch of bugs. Once I installed them everything just went to hell for instance every few hours a screeching noise would come out of the speakers and won't stop until you restart. Graphics got alot slower with frequent crashes because of the video drivers, and good luck getting anyone from Lenovo to reply on their discussion boards.Display: it's been years since I've seen screen artifacts (after I close this browser window for instance its image will still show on the screen temporarily), you'd think this is a defect of the past but this tablet brings it all back.Design: the edges where designed in such a way that hurts your hand if you hold it for more than say 15 minutes.

This happened so fast I couldn't believe it.  One minute I was calibrating the touch screen and the next minute the computer was locked up with nothing on the screen.

I called the two service centers in town and there was a 2 weeks wait to get it repaired, if it was possible.

After a while, essentially, they start collecting dust. I had one main problem with all of those tablets - plain and simple - they were just larger smartphones. Whatever I could do on my phone, I could do on my tablet, not much more.Let me also tell you that I am not a Windows 8 fan on the traditional laptop or PC. Windows 8 is specifically designed for tablet computers (you can tell by how its designed). And this tablet is a great example.The BEST PART ABOUT THIS TABLET:It is TRULY a laptop computer. It is a fully functional laptop (less powerful guts, for sure), but in the form of a tablet. While that might sound very simple and not helpful, it is the ONLY reason why I love this tablet. This tablet has a great form factor (trust me, you'll love carrying this around). It supports Office (yes, you can get work done on this tablet) and several other apps. Pair this up with a nice Bluetooth keyboard and you won't even feel the need for a laptop.At the price point it is being sold right now, this tablet is a real bargain. Its MUCH cheaper than many of the tablets in the market, and DOES MUCH MORE WORK.

After a few weeks of use, I admit I really like the new competition for Apple iPads. Windows 8 is not perfect and feels a bit like an unfinished operating system, but hopefully the coming updates will fix some of that. Trying to be a tablet and full blown PC is part of the problem. But also a strength. After years of using iPads and Android tablets, I have finally found these new Windows 8 units to be a good compromise. As far as the 1st generation units, there are just a few shortcomings (mostly Windows 8 related), but they are very usable overall. As far as the Lynx, for the price, I am quite happy. Some of the pros I see:1. Amazingly sharp high-res touch screen.2. Very light and thin.3. Full Windows 8 (not RT).4. Amazing battery life for a real windows machine. 2x the life with the optional keyboard.5. Micro-SD card slot for adding storage.6. Fast enough for all tablet uses, and usually fast enough for regular windows programs.7. Office seems to run very well, but sometimes a bit \"laggy\" to launch.And the cons:1. Screen is almost too big to be a tablet. Width is fine, but the widescreen format length is a bit long.2. The back feels a bit cheap and flexes a bit when pressed. Aluminum would have been a bit better than plastic.3. Micro-usb port and no full size USB port for using thumb drives etc unless you use the included adapter (something extra to carry if you expect to use any usb accessories). But with keyboard dock, you get 2 full size USB ports.4. Only 2 GB of ram. Sometimes it is too little. 4gb would have been more appropriate.5. 64gb of storage. 128 would have been much better, but not really an issue as you can add a memory card for music, photos ect.6. No GPS.And the optional keyboard:1. Thin and light.2. Adds an extra battery. Basically gives you about 10-15 hours of use without looking for an outlet. Amazing for a full windows machine.3. Adds 2 full size USB ports for thumb drives etc.4. Has an ugly docking connector, but seems to be durable and effective.5. Turns your tablet into a full laptop. No need to carry two items (tablet and laptop).  Use it as a tablet at home, and snap on the keyboard when traveling for added battery life and full keyboard and touchpad.Windows 8:1. Sometimes hard to deal with. Some programs/apps launch in tablet mode, some in desktop mode. Seems a bit disjointed.2. Wonderful tile interface for tablet mode. Nice desktop mode, but hard to find settings ect with no start menu anymore. Confusing until you get used to it and not very intuitive.3. Lack of some common tablet apps (like Facebook). But the good thing is you can always use the full windows version (or web) of any software.4.

It doesn't have enough performance for some apps in the windows store but I have pretty much all the apps that I need.I think it's an awesome tablet in this price range.I mostly wanted this because of Windows word 2013 & Publisher 2013, they work great. I've been using windows since -97, but this is the first time that I bought these programs,(never thought I could afford these programs before, they cost me about $209 in the windows store), it is so nice to have these programs on a tablet! I was very pleasantly surprised with the performance of Sketchbook pro 6 about $30 (download on Amazon) It's the only reason this tablet is worth sketching on, the apps I tried were way too slow for that purpose. It has taken me a lot longer time to figure this tablet out than my Android tablets, and I still have a lot of things to learn months after I bought it.A rear cam would have been nice, otherwise I have no other wishes when it comes to the design of this device.Gj Lenovo.

Overall, it functions as advertised; good processing speed, easy transitions from work screen to work screen and program to program.  I am not a computer specialist so I do not feel qualified to break its performance down on a technical level.  Here are the the issues I am having with it:No USB port:  this is probably my fault for assuming it would be there (like the commercials for these Windows tablets show) but that was one of the main reasons I chose this over an ipad.  As far as I can determine there are only three ports on the tablet, one for charging, another for headphones, and the other is a micro HDMI port.  This is in addition to the docking port.  This is likely where the USB port for this tablet is located, but obviously that is another expense.Charging- Two main issues with charging.  The first is that unless the charging cord (which is the same basic plug as you'd find for a cell phone) is plugged in at just the right angle it won't charge.  As i write this I have a small weight leaning on the plug to keep it in a position to charge.  Second, I have consistently received a warning message stating \"System overload and battery is keeping down.\"  The online manual states that \"If the system prompts \"System overload and battery capacity is keeping down !\": Decrease the volume level and display brightness and exit from any high CPU usage programs to avoid the lowering the battery capacity.\" My tablet is running no extraneous programs yet I consistently get this message while it is charging.  I have yet to be able to get the battery charge over 50%.Other than that I have not found any other major issues.

application. Because this tablet runs the full PC version of Windows 8 it very easily accomplished that task far better than other third party tablet apps I tried on the iOS platform.  I am very pleased with its performance for that task and the Lenovo is now part of my workflow.But for other tasks this tablet may or may not be useful. The first issue is that there is a severe lack of ports on the device. In fact it only has a single USB port that is also used to charge the device. A USB device cannot be used at the same time the unit is plugged into the wall for charging. And because it's charging via USB, there are times that software running on the tablet may require more power than the wall plug can provide - meaning that you could drain the battery even  if the table is plugged in.The screen is rather large for a hand held tablet, and unfortunately the 16:9 aspect ratio means the screen is both wide and narrow. It works great for my application but web browsing might prove a little more cumbersome.Battery life is surprisingly good.  Even after an hour of constant use with my video switching application the battery had an 85% charge remaining. The application isn't all that taxing, but I expected far less battery performance out of a tablet running a desktop version of the Windows 8 operating system.There is a keyboard dock available for the Lynx, but you may want to decide the overall cost of adding that accessory as compared to other tablets that might have more ports and offer more flexibility for keyboards and mice.Overall this is a good tablet for those who have specific applications that don't require a lot of USB ports.", "Title": "Good, functional tablet with great battery life but lacks ports", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "Maria Evelyn", "ReviewID": "R27WEWRLTEHSJJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet stops taking charge.Lenovos website is to complicated to get repaired.had I known it.I will forever avoid lenovo products.No star at all", "Title": "worst product quality", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "Gustavo Higon", "ReviewID": "R24GLXLB2YNWU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The lynx is wonderful and works like a charm.

All Intel tablets running the full version of windows 8 should have no less than 4GB of RAM, its just common sense.  Dont know why intel would even make a chip (x86 or x64 chip) which maxes out at 2GB, for a phone yes that is plenty but for a tablet with multitasking capabilities built into the OS no way!Never at any point when using a tablet should you get an out of memory or low memory error!  2GB of memory sets most windows 8 tablets up for failure as when you buy an intel chip you expect to be able to run apps on the desktop and flip back and forwards between desktop and modern UI's.If microsoft wonder why windows 8 is not taking off like it should its partly due to stupid decisions like this where the hardware is barely capable enough to give the user a good experience of the OS.

The specs aren't terribly powerful, but since all I needed was internet access, I figured it would be fine. It does not come with a stylus. The keyboard to make it laptop-like is expensive and klunky; I wish I had just purchased a Win8 laptop. In addition, Win8 causes it to force updates on it's own timeline. There is, as far as I can tell, no way to change when this happens, and no delay button. Unfortunately, this invariably occurs during a time when I am required to be entering weekly data, and has gotten me in trouble with my new supervisor twice now. In fairness, that is a Win8 problem, not the tablet, but it is important to know before buying. However, and this is not a Win8 issue as far as I can tell, this tablet randomly shuts off with no warning. Sometimes this happens multiple times in short order. This occurs even when it is plugged in and charging, so it isn't a power issue, and when it happens it deletes the data I have entered so that I have to start over. On one infuriatingly memorable occasion, what should have been a 30 minute data entry session took me close to four hours. After adding apps for Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps (I commute to clients) and a chat program, plus Microsoft Office, the processor is warning me that it is approaching capacity and the function of the machine is noticeably slowed. It is positively useless, despite attempted solutions, and by the time I determined this the return window had expired. I bought the extended warranty, so it cost me about $400 of utter wasted money.
