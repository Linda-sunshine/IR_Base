{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Traveler", "ReviewID": "R3BT0UYIOJ3IFV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading a few theoretical reviews, I thought I would post a very early review based on one whole day of using my Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus (which I've updated a couple of times).  I've rated it overall 4*, which is 5* for the Tab and 3* for a premium price.  There are certainly less expensive tablets, but I think this one really does have class-leading features.  It's up to you whether you think the features justify the price or whether you want to wait for the next better-faster-cheaper version.Not much to say about the design, it's a slab but the build quality is excellent and it feels very solid.  I bought this specifically because it's a 7\" form factor, and I wanted portable and pocketable which this delivers.  I've posted a picture of what's in the box, it's just the tablet, charger and cable [see photo on the product page].  Don't plan on learning much from the \"manual\", which is a tiny little booklet.  One thing I can't say is whether it has Gorilla Glass like the original Tab.  I hope so, but Samsung doesn't say much as Amazon shipped before the release date -- heck, Samsung won't even let me register it yet.  The screen quality, brightness and resolution is excellent although I did wind up disabling auto brightness as I thought it kept things a little dark.  Easily fixed by manually setting the brightness to about 60%.  The auto setting was probably to save battery life, which seems excellent.  Charged to 100% this morning, and after a day of light usage (web browsing, wifi on all day, an hour of music listening, dozen or so apps loaded, 15 minutes of navigation) I still have 51% remaining after a day of usage.  [11/6] I'm still happy with battery life, but I will say watching Netflix looks like it would only last about 4-5 hours.Honeycomb with this tablet is extremely responsive, and I didn't find Touch Wiz intrusive.  Actually everything pretty much just works the way you'd hope.  GPS and Google Maps worked great, got sat lock in only a few minutes sitting on the passenger seat of the car.  Local driving, but Google Maps cached enough that nav worked great.  [11/6] In answer to several comments, the GPS works without wifi.  Google Maps caches some local coverage, and there are standalone nav apps that have broader coverage.  If traffic updates are important, you won't get them with no wifi.Tried the camera, it's point-and-shoot cellphone quality but nothing approaching even my Lumix camera let alone a DSLR.  [11/12] But apps like Barcode Scanner and Skype make good use of the cameras.  The touchscreen is very responsive, and Netflix and Youtube looked great on my home wifi.  No problems at all with any of the apps I downloaded, they all ran and looked great.  [11/12] The 1.5.14 Pandora update fixes my previous UI complaint, so Pandora now looks as good as it sounds.  If you want to pretend to buy this for work with a clear conscience, I also setup the built-in VPN client and was able to load a free RDP application (Pocketcloud) from the Android market to access our Windows servers just fine.  [11/12]  The Peel Smart Remote folks never answered their email support form (why bother to have it if you don't respond?), but their 1.2.6 update did deliver basic support for my Time Warner/Motorola DVR so I've now had a chance to use the built-in remote.  The personalized program guide is nice and I might actually use it.  But the remote functions supported are pretty basic so I'll still be using my Logitech Harmony - maybe they'll create an app!If you're looking for a smaller tablet with all the bells and whistles, I think you'd be happy with this one.", "Title": "First impression, premium tablet at premium price.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Author": "David Dean", "ReviewID": "R2IEFW8MEB68Y7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT:  Now the product has been tested more in more depth.  My initial review still stands.  I have edited the review to include more content concerning features.  ThanksFirst off I would like to state that this product has now been tested for two days.  If anything changes my opinion of it I will be glad to update this review.When getting this package I must admit I was filled with anticipation and some level of worry.  This tablet is going to be used for both recreational and business purposes so it had to be capable of doing a large number of things.  At first glance I have to say it is a real beauty.  It features a slick and stylish design capable of impressing nearly anyone.  Mine was charged to approximately 68% when I received it so I was able to turn it on and start right away. It took me approximately 10 minutes to get it started and linked to my google account.  Here came my first surprise.  Already having an android phone it then proceeded to download my saved contacts and apps that were own my phone.  This saved me lots of time and was a big plus.Briefly I would like to list features of the Tablet and give a quick run down:SCREEN -Very bright and clear.  This screen is impressive to say the least.  It comes auto set to change the lighting itself but you can turn that off and set the brightness to whatever level you choose.TOUCHSCREEN -Aside from being bright it is also very responsive to touch.  For this part of the test I went to my father.  My father has larger fingers and usually has problems with small buttons or touch screens.  He was impressed at how easy he could type and not make mistakes on the device.CAMERA -This is a noteworthy camera.  I was able to take a few decent shots with it and saw no real problems.Edit:  Tested out the video chat feature and had no problems it is a reasonably clear image.BLUETOOTH -No problems at all.  It linked to my phone and I was even able to tether internet to the tablet.GPS -Now first I was concerned GPS applications for download.  However after a few times using it I have decided I rather like it.  Here are three reasons why!1) I bought a tablet not a GPS!2) There are various different apps available on the market that seem to enable offline gps support.3) You can start the Navigation while connected to WiFi and it will load all the information for a route and then it works perfectly.  I even managed to get it to reprogram the route by turning the wrong way once.  All in all it is just an added feature that is fun to use and can be useful if you pre program it at home.SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ-Samsung has made a nice skin that overlays the natural Android design.  I found it both user friendly and rather fun to play with.  It took nothing away from the tablet, but added a few features that made it worthwhile!GAMES -Naturally I tried out a few games such as Angry Birds and others. This tablet played them with no problem and they looked even better than ever with a clear crisp image.MEDIA CENTER -I took the time to watch tv (Netflix) and listen to music (Pandora).  Both were clear and crisp in sound quality making the tablet good to use standalone. However Samsung also provides Ear buds if you do not want the entire room to hear what you are watching!PEEL -Edit:  Having first tested the remote on an old model tv I was unable to provide a clear picture of the features.  Now I have fully tested this features and I am impressed.  The Peel remote control offers an easy to use interface to change the channel, volume, or access menu.  Simply WONDERFUL.BATTERY LIFE -Honestly I cannot say much about the battery life of the product.  I charged it once and have used it off and on all day with little battery drainage.Edit:  Test and can now state that it held a charge for over a day with constant off and on usage.  It only showed a serious drop in life after watching roughly 45 minutes of netflix on full brightness.All in all the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.0 plus is an ideal tablet for anyone wanting to jump into the tablet market.  I would gladly make this purchase all over again.", "Title": "Samsung has it Right", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Author": "M. Gymnopoulos", "ReviewID": "R14O08D5RLB1N3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I have to say that I am in general really satisfied with this product. Size and weight are perfect. The 1.2 Ghz dual core Exynos processor is great and in general the tab is fast. It is sometimes a bit choppy when exiting applications and if you return to the homescreens: Widgets are sometimes empty and refresh for a second but nothing to bother. I guess Honeycomb 3.2 is not optimized for the Tab 7 plus yet and Samsung has to polish the drivers a bit.The biggest problem I ran into so far are occasionally random reboots or random shut downs (Screen of death). I haven't manipulated the OS or installed problematic applications. At XDA forum I saw that several people had problems with random shutdowns so I guess it is a software problem and I hope that Samsung is aware of it and will fix it soon. I had two Tab 7 Plus and both had these problems. I had to return the first one because of some screen defects. The second is fine except for the mentioned problem. I can't wait to see ICS on this beast.Update regarding the random shut downs: I find my second tablet once per day shut off. I have to do a reboot (pressing on/off button and the volume rocker) to turn it on again and it doesn't shut off because of an empty battery; I checked that already. I will send this Tab back again. I just haven't decided yet if I will return it for a refund or if I try another exchange. 400 Dollars are too much for a buggy device.Update 11/27/11I decided to return my second Tab too. The random shut downs are bugging me and so far no fix. No statement from Samsung regarding this problem yet. If Samsung will fix this problem I will buy this tablet again, except there will be better ones out.", "Title": "Great tablet but not without problems", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RFGUD11RMP9Z0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using 10\" tablets and 3.5\"-4.5\" smartphones for the last 18 months. That included iOS and Android OS spread over 6 different devices. But what I was looking for was a compromise between the large, heavy tablets and tiny phones. So I spent the last couple months debating the offerings in the 7\" market.B&N; Nook is rootable and has a good rep in the geek community, but out of the box it lacks too many features (1GB usable storage for non-B&N; content and lacking B&N; content).Kindle Fire almost seduced me, but I canceled my pre-order when I considered the specs. No camera for video chatting, only 8GB storage memory, a funky flipboard-like interface and a limited app store. It's good for beginners and budget conscience, but woefully underpowered for a 10\" veteran tablet user.So I opted for the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. For an extra $200 (over the Kindle Fire), I get two cameras, double the internal memory, a microSD card to add more video content, a working GPS for the car, and a fancy smart remote.The build quality feels secure. Not \"plasticky\" but not unnecessarily heavy either (i.e. no hard chrome backing of the iPad or Asus Transformer). The toughest part of this tablet is the screen. I've used it a week without any case or screen protector and it has not so much as a scratch.So far I'm content with my purchase. Touchwiz seems to work better on my Galaxy SII phone, but it's not horrible. Honeycomb's most annoying feature to me is the always-on menu at the bottom. Adding the screen capture button just guarantees you take lots of unwanted pics. Ice Cream Sandwidth should do away with this problem, as least while watching video.One thing I really appreciate about the 7.0 Tab is how well it retains a charge while in sleep mode. It is comparable to my iPad, able to live off the charger all day and only burn the power I need for use. And that's with GPS on. I wish my Transformer and Galaxy SII did as well.This is a device perfect for someone wants the tablet experience without having to invest in a massive purse or backpack. it does all the Kidnle and Nook do, but with full fledged Android Honeycomb features.", "Title": "Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus vs Kindle Fire vs B&N; Nook", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TMWGDW4GZZ88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus for a couple of days now, adding apps and tweaking settings and such. I must say, that this is a really nifty tablet. The screen size is right where I want it; big enough to comfortably view websites and small enough to carry around the house and on the go.The tablet is very responsive and the interface navigation and customization via the settings is excellent. The pre-installed software (aka BloatWare) is actually more than half useful and easy to remove from sight, residing in the app section where you never have to see them, but available to use or put back if you change your mind.The screen display is very nice and I suppose if you were to do a side by side comparison with other tablets, you would find that a few of them have better screens that only then would be noticeable, but know this, the screen in the Tab+ easily meets my expectations for a quality display.The camera (front 2 megapixel and rear 3 megapixel) and the video option are simply adequate. Good for Social Media and such, but certainly not a replacement for a good digital camera or smart phone. Does have a flash which is nice.One feature that tilted me toward this tablet was the microSD slot. Being able add and swap out as needed 32gb is pretty sweet.I have two 32gb cards; one with all my music and documents and one that I dedicate for movies and photos. When shopping for any tablet, if you can, try to get one with this feature. You won't regret it.You hear a lot of gas about the Android Marketplace vs. the Apple App Store. I honestly don't care which store has the most apps. What I care about is do they have the apps that I actually use on a daily basis.I would suggest you go to the Android Marketplace via your browser and have a look. It had versions of all the apps that I wanted. Though since I don't game on my tablet, I can't vouch for that aspect.Right now, my apps are a mix of pre-installed and thru the Android Marketplace (both paid and free):Pre-Installed:Amazon Kindle - a few minutes on Amazon and I had it ready for downloading books.Video Player - I may change this out for something else. Still undecided.YouTube - it's there, just in case. You never know when Rebecca Black is going to release a new video.Camera - simple to use, adequate for my needs.  Though I do wish they would have increased the quality.Polaris Office - mobile version of MicrosoftOffice? You can create documents, spreadsheets and slides.Contacts - using the pre-installed; though I imagine that there are fancier ones on the Marketplace.Calendar - same thing, meets my needs, but power users will want to head on over to the Marketplace.Maps - ala google; very handy to have.Of special note:Social Hub - this Samsung App is pretty cool. It's a one stop app for my Facebook and Twitter feeds plus gmail. Two thumbs up.Peel Smart Remote - another feature I was very interested in. Pretty darn easy to set up. Got my HD TV, Audio System and TIVO box dialed in and ready to go in a matter of minutes. Beautiful interface too. But all said and done, a resounding \"Meh\". If you are familiar with the look of NetFlix this is kinda how they did the navigation interface. My deal is that I just want to cut to the chase. My TIVO records all the shows I'm interested in and I use my universal remote to channel surf when I feel the need.  Peel just doesn't quite fit the way I watch T.V. Others may disagree.  Again, really slick interface, just a wrong navigation convention for me.Android Marketplace Apps (paid and free)Dolphin Browser HD - EXTREMELY happy with this browser for the internet. Very speedy, great interface and easy to use. You really need to consider this one.Pulse - Wow. I was able to take all the info websites that I normally visit one at a time and put them all into this newsfeed aggregator. I can get my daily fix of news and information in half the time. You can also separate your feeds into different tabbed sections; News, lifestyle, fun stuff, etc.AutoDesk SketchBook - Great way to sketch out concepts and ideas. Kudos on the interface and ease of use.Skype - Video chat and all of that.RadioScanner - who doesn't want to know what local law enforcement is doing? This app is an absolute 10-34.UNO - a time-waster's dream of card gaming heaven.iHeartRadio - internet radio of ClearChannel stations.SpeedTest - gives you a fair idea of how fast your wifi connection is to your tablet.Of special note:mSecure - way to secure all your logins and passwords into one handy location. You only have to remember one password to get in and from there jump to the various websites that have login screens. The cool thing is that they have Android, Windows, Apple and iPhone versions that can synch with each other via WiFi.Conclusion:This was a big step for me since I have been in the Apple environment pretty much exclusively. I kinda feel like Logan's Run; escaping the Apple BubbleDome to see what the real World is actually like.  Thanks to WiFi, my iMac, iPhone and now my new tablet are best of friends and play well in my own little networked playground.g.", "Title": "Not too big Not too small tablet with all the mostly right features.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "Ted R.

Just to start, I own a Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S1)phone and I have tried my friend's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 a couple of times. Those are the only items I can compare on (I know they're not comparable to other tablets similar with the Tab Plus 7.0) but these are just a basis in case you own those devices.Screen:I am just basing this on what it looked like since I am a little bit lazy to research on the exact resolution of each screen. The screen on the Tab 7 Plus is somewhat similar in looks with the 10.1 but falls short when you're used to using a Super AMOLED screen (in my case, my Galaxy1 phone) I see the big difference every time I switch between the tab and my phone. SAMOLED screen is sharper and has very high contrast. But if you haven't owned a device with an amoled screen, you would give this tab's screen 5 stars because it's really good compared to other tablet screens i've seen in Bestbuy.GPS:Very spot on! (at least compared to my Captivate phone which had some issues before I installed a custom firmware on it) I have not tried navigation yet which I know should be the ultimate test on a gps but I walked about a mile with it and seems great to me. \"GPS status\" app from market locks up 12-14 satellites with SNR constant to about 40. But again, I haven't tried yet on how it deals with driving. I will have to give you an update on that..**UPDATE: 11/18. I tried driving for an hour upstate and back using Google Navigation (phone data is tethered to the tab plus, took about 5MB of map data in 2 hours). It's very accurate and responsive. It did not have any problems at all. :)Speed:Dual core SoC Exynos 1.2Ghz.. Very fast! Smooth scrolling and very fluid. One of the reasons why I didn't get the tab 10.1 is for some reason, its scrolling are not that smooth even if I try other launchers. But this tab plus 7.0 really makes the 10.1 look bad when it comes to simply scrolling. Launching apps is very fast as well. I haven't encountered any hiccup within an app. I have yet to try playing graphic intensive games. Will update again..Universal Remote? (Peel SmartRemote App):This is one of the reason why I got this tablet. There are limited tablets out there who has a built-in IR port for controlling Home theater systems. The app is pretty good but I don't think this can replace a Logitech Harmony remote right away since this software is pretty new. Their database for devices is somewhat limited for me. I own an old Samsung 46 inch LCD which the app can control. It can also control my Time Warner cable box and my Denon AVR 1911 receiver (ON/OFF/VOLUME/INPUT SOURCES only. doesn't support all buttons. I love the way Peel displays all the TV shows that are currently. You won't need to browse through the guide on your tv anymore. You can display based on genre (drama, comedy, action, sports etc) and you can even personalize your channels from there. Bottomline, the app is currently good on replacing you TV/Cable remote but is still limited in supporting other remotes. As for streaming players, it only has support for Apple TV and Roku for now. I submitted a request to Peel to support WDTV Live device, let's see how it turns out. By the way, search youtube for \"Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Universal Remote\". Someone did an early post on what the universal remote app looks like.**UPDATE 1/17/2012: I ended up buying a Logitech Harmony 650 for only $49 (sold by Amazon and it's an excellent remote for the price!) because I gave up on the Peel app because the app development is very slow. At the very least, they do reply when you ask for support but I don't think this Smart Remote app is priority to them.WIFI:I get around the max 15Mbps limit on my Speed test app on this comparing to 5Mbps on my Captivate phone connected to 2.4GHz band. I tried the 5Ghz band and had same result for the Tab plus. I guess I have to try another app that would display more accurate results. My point is that it is fast. Browsing is very fast and very smooth. I watch HD trailers on the Movie Fone app and youtube without any hiccup.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Speed definitely varies and has different factors like ISP, router, wifi chipset, CPU specs, OS etc. But I recently noticed that the wifi of this tab has the same performance as my desktop on quadcore proc, 12GB ram, dualband wifi, windows 7 64bit specs. Goes up to 30Mbps (Time Warner turbo boost)on my 15Mbps connection.Camera:Pretty good. 3MP back and 2MP front is enough to take decent pictures and videos. Did Skype a couple of times and they say my video quality on both cams is good. Oh and audio quality is superb and LOUD considering its size!Size and Weight:This is pretty much a perfect balance between a phone and a laptop for me. Fits in your pocket and it's big enough to browse and watch movies. It has a very premium feel. Build quality is awesome.Battery:So far so good. I've only had this for two days, charged a couple of times for a few minutes to an hour but I've only had it charged to 100% once. And battery performance is great!**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Battery has been superb for me lasts about 7-8 hours of almost nonstop use (surfing the web, youtube, music, skyping, streaming videos and downloading files. Battery drain is very little on standby so I won't worry if I don't use it for a couple of days.Overall:This is a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking great looks, performance and portability. For you guys who are used to having super AMOLED screens, you might want to wait for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 version but it will definitely come at a higher price. But I don't think it will be worth it if its price goes $100 higher than the Tab 7.0 Plus. I think I would prefer a 7 inch screen which is just right for one hand. We'll see when the 7.7 gets released.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012- Now that the price for this tab is only $350, I'd forget about the tab 7.7. I am 100% contented with this after almost 3 months of use. I've been using this without any problems at all and it always gives me the best performance regardless of how many apps i throw at it. Definitely worth every penny!", "Title": "Great tablet!

I had targeted the Coby Kyros as more in line with my budget, but fortune smiled on me and I got the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus new-in-box on Craigslist the day after Christmas for $260 (at the time they were $399 on Amazon).  Right after I bought it, the price plummeted $50 on Amazon to it's current $349-ish.  Had I the money and the chance to do it all over again, I would buy the Samsung every time.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you immediately install the Kies program from the Samsung website on to your desktop/laptop and connect it to the Samsung.  The updates made things MUCH better for me and I had the thing 5 days before I did that- notably the annoying AP mobile app that came with it that wouldn't uninstall or move off the home screen until the update.  I have some 4 gigs of ebooks and 10 gigs of audio library, so I immediately got a 16gb MicroSD card for it, giving me a total of 32 gb on the tab.

This is the first tablet that I have, or at least the first one that I am keeping. First purchase was an Impression tablet that I returned the day after I received it - it was garbage and I didn't want to spend time trying to make it work. Was hesitant to purchase this Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus as there were no actual reviews at that time. But because the Samsung Galaxy 7.0 had many positive reviews, I thought that the 7.0 Plus couldn't fall far from the other one. Received it the other day and I really love it. It was ready right out of the box. Touchscreen is very responsive, screen resolution is very clear although I can see what other reviewers say that the switch in screen orientation is not instant -- probably almost a second delayed. Not so big of a deal for me. Picture clarity is not totally bad but could be better but I don't plan to use this tablet much for taking pictures and videos. I purchased it for the sole purpose of playing games, checking news, weather, maybe my e-mails, do some virtual window shopping . . . just things to keep me occupied if stuck with some time doing nothing. The only thing is that because of the location of the power button, I tend to accidentally press on it when I pick it up (not everytime but from time to time). Also, it has slipped off my hand twice already (quite slim for my hand or it's just probably me) so I am hoping to find a pocketbook-like case so I have a better grip on it. This tablet probably have way more features than I need, or would ever discover (for now, at least), but I wanted to get one that I would keep for years ahead. Like I said, I am not a techie so I don't necessarily get excited with every new gadget that comes out. I just want one that I like and that works for what I need and the Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus is exactly the one that does that for me.", "Title": "I love this tablet a lot", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Author": "Natalie", "ReviewID": "R32041ZOQUGQW6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS: size and weight, picture quality, fast processor, battery life, good-looking design, bluetoothCONS: expensive, if you have a spotty WIFI connection it really limits the use of the tablet, lack of integrated USB/HDMI (you can buy an adapter for this - about $30)I bought this tablet because I really wanted a reader for books but I thought I might like to watch movies occasionally and surf the web when I travel. For me the size/weight is perfect. It is the lightest mainstream 7.0 tablet I have seen and very easy to hold. I spent hours reading for school yesterday on it without a problem. I should mention too, the battery life is excellent so far. I spent about 5 hours reading, downloading apps and movies and just messing around the internet and the battery was at 50%. I left it overnight without charging and today spent an additional couple hours playing around and still 30% on battery life.The tablet itself is pretty fast, although I must say, if you don't have a good WIFI connection, you will be disappointed.  I am living in a dorm with community WIFI and it is SLOW! Many times  I got kicked off the internet or the Android market...etc. So watching streaming video was difficult. A tablet is pretty much for internet-based activities so if you don't have good WIFI you may consider getting a 3G tablet from your wireless company or don't even bother with the tablet. Although I discovered today that you can download rental movies and save them to the tablet for 30 days and then watch offline if you wish. So I bought a rental and am letting it download now while I am not using the tablet.As far as lacking the USB/HDMI ports, to me this is a non-issue. The Acer Iconia A100 has this included and I toyed with the idea of getting this tablet instead (especially because it was $50 cheaper than the Samsung) BUT...(1) when do I ever need my tablet to hook up to USB or HDMI? I have a laptop, I have a DVD player for my TV, ... I mean the point of a small tablet like this is to be able to carry it in your purse for reading books and watching movies on the go. So for me, not an issue. (2) the Acer is quite a bit heavier and has half the battery life. It is still a viable contender though so definitely take a look when you're shopping.Some have complained that the apps are lacking for android versus iPad. Again I say, the Samsung 7.0 Plus basically a fancy reader. If you want something that has the capabilities of a computer, get an iPad. Certainly the iPad can do a lot more than this, but it is heavier and quite a bit more expensive. But if you want something lightweight and portable to read books, this is certainly a better choice. And furthermore, I have downloaded about 10 apps today to tablet that all work fine. All the mainstream stuff is available. Android will catch up with Apple now that android tablets are on the rise.In my opinion, you get what you pay for. This is a little more expensive than other 7 inch tablets, but it has great battery life, a dual-core processor for fast response, and is very lightweight. It's quite a bit cheaper than an iPad but of course, it doesn't do everything an iPad does, so there you go.", "Title": "Perfect sized reader with all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged tablet", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"azoomzip\"", "ReviewID": "R1G2B04H4VN9BN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews cover most of the relevant aspects of this tab so I will just cover my experience quickly.  I have owned many of the tabs on the market- Ipad 1 and 2, Xoom, Touchpad, Kindle Fire, Original Galaxy Tab 7, Galaxy Tab 10.1, 8.9 and this.  I love the Ipad but prefer Android to IOS.  I also find the most important aspect of any tablet to be it's ergonomics- size and weight- which is why I am such a fan of these new Galaxy Tabs and, to a lesser extent, the Ipad 2.  My favorite tab so far is the Galaxy Tab 8.9.Physically this tab is the perfect 7 incher- I love it.  I could have held out for the 7.7 but as an owner of the 8.9 I am not sure the 7.7 is a good fit.  Anyway, this thing is snappier than the 8.9 and really nice in every physical sense.  The huge drawback, however, is the weak or buggy wifi.  I don't know if I have a faulty unit, but it constantly drops wifi in areas that have a strong or at least good signal with every other device I own.  I hope it is a bug or a faulty unit because it is an absolute deal breaker.  I will keep it for another week or so just to be sure, but there is a really good chance this thing is going back simply due to this one critical weakness.  What a shame.Update 12/04/2011So after further testing I have upgraded my first review from 2 to 3 stars.I didn't have a lot of time to play with it over Thanksgiving weekend and this past week I upgraded my router from a D-Link 655 to an Apple Airport Extreme.  The D-Link was a solid router for the year I had it but the Extreme is about 25% more powerful and allowed me to get rid of the booster I had in my garage.  I am somewhat suspicious that my 2 networks has something to do with constantly dropping the connection the on the tab 7 Plus so I put that criticism aside.  In any case, the Galaxy Tab 7 Plus no longer seems to randomly drop the wifi and while that is great, it doesn't change the fact that the Tab 7 Plus is the only device that suffered from this issue with the old router.  Furthermore, in testing with the Airport Extreme, the Tab 7 is still at least 1 bar (if not 2) less powerful than the Kindle Fire, latest gen Ipod Touch, Galaxy Tab 8.9 or Ipad 2.  I really want to love it because it is nicest 7\" tablet on the market, but last night I was losing the wifi connection out in my garage- the same spot that all of the aforementioned devices had 2 to 3 bars.Clearly this thing has a less powerful wifi chip than many of its competitors which may or may not make a difference to you depending on the size of your house/ network.  If you can live with this issue it is the nicest 7\" tab I have seen, but if you have a larger network and want reliability you might want to hold out for something better.  It is hard to say but for $399 it is a deal breaker for my needs and I will be returning it.  I take one and a half stars away for Samsung skimping on the wifi chip and I take a half star for it being over priced (I understand all the pricing variables but Samsung needs to find a way for this to be competitive- a $100 premium would be more appropriate).", "Title": "Very nice tab- great weight- overpriced IMHO- weak wifi", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Author": "Alaina Mccormick", "ReviewID": "R127F8E6CX9MB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a first-gen iPad and was considering getting the newest iPad, however I realized I didn't like to use it much because it was too big (uncomfortable to hold during long reading/browsing sessions)and didn't have removable storage (I like to have lots of space to store movies).  I had heard good things about the Galaxy Tab line and found the Tab 7 Plus on sale, so I decided to pick one up and try it out for a while.At first I had mixed feelings.  The device is very light and easy to hold for a long time.  Video looked great and it has an excellent speaker.  Web browsing is quick and responsive.  But the interface felt very sluggish and laggy - it would sometimes freeze up for a few seconds when transitioning from one app to the next. I like to use the device in landscape mode but I found it too difficult to type on because my thumbs couldn't reach the middle of the virtual keyboard.  I loaded the RSS reader I use on my phone (NewsRob) and found the interface ill-suited to the screen size with tiny, hard-to-read text.After some Google research however, I found a few key apps that completely transformed the experience.  ADW Launcher EX is an interface replacement that dramatically speeds up and reduces the lag I was experiencing in addition to adding some nifty 3D effect options.  The SwiftKey Tablet X keyboard app replaces the virtual keyboard with a 'split' keyboard that puts all keys within reach of your thumbs.  It also has a key to switch to a standard keyboard on the fly - very handy.  JustReader is a tablet-oriented RSS reader that allows you to customize font size to a comfortable level.I now love this tablet.  The size and light weight make it very easy to throw in my laptop bag & carry around.  I picked up a 32 gig micro SD card so I now have a lot more storage than I would be able to afford on an iPad.  The Kindle app makes it an excellent e-reader. The speaker is loud enough that I can play podcasts, audiobooks or radio streams and hear them just fine.  I can take photos on my Android phone and send them to the Tab via Bluetooth.  It has built-in DLNA sharing so you can stream videos from it to DLNA devices like smart TVs, PS3s or (in my case) Xbox 360.  The front-facing camera makes it an excellent Skype video call device.

That would be the original iPad and the Asus Transformer.  I sold the iPad because it was way too heavy and cumbersome.  The Asus Transformer was fantastic but I sold it to a friend who really wanted it because of of the HDMI out capability.In my next tablet, I was looking for a smaller form factor because I typically use it on the train to read ebooks and magazines.  For me, a 10 inch tablet, no matter how light, just isn't the best size.  The Galaxy Tab 7 Plus is a perfect blend of size and capability.  Apps load quickly and run crisply.  I've watched a few videos that I've converted from DVDs and they run smoothly without any problems.The display is excellent.  Coming from the IPS display of the Asus Transformer, I don't really notice a big difference with Samsung's PLS.  Both are excellent, bright displays the have sharp text and vibrant colors.The micro SD card slot is a great feature.  Allows me to easily expand the storage capabilities of the device, which is very important since I store a lot of pics and swap out video files.  Easily one of the devices best features.My only complaint is the button placement.  The power button is right above the two volume buttons.  I would prefer to have it on top or on the opposite side as it is quite easy to press it accidently when trying to adjust volume.Price wise, it is on the more expensive side especially when you consider that a tablet with a bigger display isn't much more expensive.

It's definitely made for the more sophisticated and computer-savvy tablet user since there's abit of a learning curve to get started if you're not familiar with the Android interface and apps but it took me just a day to get started downloading/installing apps and turning my tablet into an ereader like none other.

I also have owned iPad 1 for a year, my first tablet.  I do email, news, web browsing, light gaming, and watching videos, in locations not convenient for PC or netbook use (bed and couch loafing, waiting at a buisness, travelling, etc.).  I bought the 7.0 Plus for something more portable.  I really wanted the 7.7, but at the time its availability was not a certainty. The 7.0 Plus is a nice portable device, mostly a joy to use. Here are some specifics:1) Physical appearance and hardware.  Very solid build, not too slippery, easy to hold for long periods.  It is easy to push the on/off button by mistake due to its location.  When held in landscape, speakers are both on the same side, but they are excellent in volume and clarity for such a small device.  One big complaint is the glass - smudges and fingerprints are more difficult to remove than with the oleophobic coating on the glass of my other tablet.  Another big complaint is the microSD card - I have not found any way to access stored files from within the apps.  You have to go into the preloaded Myfiles app and find the memory card folder, and click on a file to view or play it.  I also can't transfer files stored on the microSD card to other locations on the tablet - once the files are transferred to the card from a PC via Samsung Kies (their equivalent to iTunes), they appear to be read-only.  I can live with this for now.2). Screen. Resolution is good, very clear with true colors, better than specs would indicate. It's best to have brightness on manual, otherwise auto changes in brightness are annoying, and even in manual mode, the screen brightens when on web pages.  Screen brightness set at 25-30% is plenty for most uses.  Sometimes the touchscreen doesn't respond and you have to tap harder or more than once (all touchscreens are like this to some degree). Unlike others, I didn't find viewing angles were a problem.3). Layout. The TouchWiz system with widgets took getting used to, but it didn't annoy me once it was customized.  I wish more widgets could be changed in size (only a few of them can).  The system bar at lower right gives quick access to all of the important stuff.  Sometimes the swiping across home screen menus lagged or was jumpy, but otherwise the nested layout and embedded menus were easy to learn and get used to.  The keyboard works but if you have wide fingertips like me, you will make mistakes due to the size of the keys, especially in portrait.  I tried a stylus and it worked great on this device.4). Wifi and speed. I had no trouble, it seemed to stream HD videos in Youtube really well, and load web pages quickly, even when the signal wasn't full bars. Connectivity on-the-go was easy.  When web surfing, this device is faster than my other tablet. Light gaming I did worked well but I only tried 2 apps.5). Battery life.  It is fair, I get about 6 hours on a charge, and that's with all of the recommended battery saving features set.  Charger takes about 3-4 hours to charge from down below 10% up to 100%.6). Operating system and apps.  Android and Google still need some polishing.  Several apps, including some of the news apps, did not allow me to zoom while on the home screen, and thus the print of the article titles was really small.  As noted by others, Android should improve file management, and my above comments about the microSD card is proof of that. The users guide for this device is better than some, but certain tasks were not intuitive and needed greater detail. I had similar problems with other Android Market apps, even a few that were supposedly optimized for tablets. I also had difficulty linking my google account with Youtube, and thus the Youtube app would not let me save favorites.  You have to create a google (Gmail) account to set up and register the tablet, but I could not find any place on the tablet to log out afterwards. After a week of reading forums, I found out you have to go into the Google site on a PC and log out from there - very silly (not the fault of the device)!  Because a Gmail account is open all of the time with no way to log out within Android, I was insecure about using it for anything other than getting Market apps.  As a result, I have decided not to use Gmail for any email-related stuff, and I set up a widget on the home screen to access my currently active email account with a different address.  These are obvious examples of Android and Google quirks that others have noted. On the upside, I did not have any problem with the system crashing (\"screen of death\", etc.), but I did not try any heavy gaming.  I also did not test the Peel smart remote yet.To summarize, this is a better tablet than other cheaper 7\" devices I looked at - it is very fast and capable, even with its quirks.  I hope future OS updates are seamless like they are with my other tablet, which I believe to be overall better and still not out-of-date.  I wish I could get a good rubberized sleeve to protect the edges if it ever gets dropped, but currently nobody makes one for this tablet and the choice of form-fitting cases or sleeves currently available for this model is pretty slim.  For these reasons, and the fact that it is pricey next to some other 7\" tablets, I give it 4 stars.", "Title": "Great small tablet but with some quirks", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Author": "Ryan Sorkness", "ReviewID": "RE2OEOZRGDMZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So for the longest time I was on the fence about buying a tablet.

The only problem I had with it is the Wifi. I don't know if it is is a problem with just the one that I have, or if it is a problem in general. If I am standing in front of the router with the tab aimed at the router, I get full bars. If I turn my back on the router, it drops one bar. If I walk twenty or so feet away, it loses another bar. I also have an iPad2 and an iPod. I tested it against the wireless capabilities on the iPad, iPod, and my Evo, and none of those suffer from the Wifi attenuation like my tab. In areas where the Galaxy Tab could not connect, my other wireless devices showed full signal, and were able to connnect and browse at full speed. I noticed that if I moved my hands a bit around it, I got a better signal. But the signal was the absolute worst when I had both hands holding it at the bottom. That is naturally where I hold a device of this size.  I also tried all of this on two different wireless networks.  Same exact results.I am very sad. I was really looking forward to this purchase.

It has a faster CPU, Better Camera (LED Flash), it's thinner, it's brushed metal back looks nicer, pen memo and eBook come built in, and it will get updated to ICS, so it will have the same OS as the 2 7.0, but it will perform better, while maintaining about the same battery life.Ecosystem = 5/5. If you are getting out of the Kindle or Nook ecosystem, you are in luck. Kindle and Nook apps are available in the Play Store, so you can redownload all your favorite books onto your Galaxy Tab. And you can easily download free epub books from the internet to the built in eBook app (or third-party apps from the play store like Aldiko).I love this tablet, and it will rein supreme after it gets updated to ICS!", "Title": "Can't explain in just a title.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "Mecha Aslan", "ReviewID": "R2DUI7GUPJ7MQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read many reviews and decided to pull the trigger on this SGT 7.0+ Tab at a local electronics store.I've had it for about a week and so far, I'm really impressed with it.

Both the Samsung and Android app stores worked very well.  The Gmail app allowed me to synch with my multiple gmail accounts seamlessly, and offered filtering options for which accounts to synch mail, contacts, and calendars.  The Google Talk app allowed me to remotely chat with my staff when needed.  It has a good quality camera, and sharing pictures on Facebook was very easy.Some of the drawbacks: the native email app had issues sending emails.

I can drag and drop media files from Windows without \"jailbreak\"-style root hacks. I can clear RAM and running programs with a single click, I can encrypt the entire device natively in the OS, and it can still be rooted quite easily if needed for more control. This Tab comes with a decent software bundle as well. I like the seamless integration of the Google apps, and the Android Market is quickly becoming as well endowed as the Apple Store. It also comes with an MS Office clone that can read/write common Office files.The only improvements I would make is get rid of the proprietary USB cable and just use a standard mini USB. Also, Samsung needs to ship new products with the latest OS. At my time of purchase, it should have come with ICS 4.x instead of 3.2. At least offer it as an update.

Even though the Galaxy has huge storage and even a memory card for extra, you won't lose things you bought through Google or Amazon if the unit fails somehow.

I spend untold hours searching and reading reviews on all the available 7-8 inch tabs, and viewed many video reviews as well.  Looked at the main contenders, including the HTC Flyer, Acer Iconia a100, Kindle Fire, BB Playbook, Sony, as well as the \"cheapie\" Chinese versions of tablets that are flooding the market.  This seemed to be the best rated overall, with the only real downside being the $400 price tag, in light of the supposed Galaxy 7.7 somewhere on the horizon.  Didn't want to wait for the 7.7, which would appear to be the best, but at present it is non-existent.  The Plus as mentioned is very fast, easy to use, and quite intuitive, especially for those of us with Android phone experience.  The WiFi is strong and connects easily, and from a great distance.  I have not had issues as some have had here, with dropped connections.  Bought a Roo leather cover which is nice, and an Ankor dock for bedside.  Still learning what apps are best for tablet use and experimenting.  All the basics--Pandora, Facebook and other social media on the Social Media Hub, TuneIn Radio, Droid AntiVirus, etc., all work great.  The few tablet games I've downloaded all work great, but I haven't dabbled too much in them yet.  One VERY cool app that I have on my Android phone is SplashTop, where I can access fully my computer at home through my phone, which works ok with 3G, but great if connected to WiFi.  Since I already had a SplashTop account on my home computer, I was able to add the SplashTop app at no extra charge to my Plus as well!  And it works even better on the Tab.  SplashTop allows you to fully access your home PC, for example, and use it remotely.  It plays back sound and video through the Plus (or through an Android phone).  As well as it worked with my phone, it's several times better, and faster, with the Galaxy Plus.  That this works so smoothly is important to me for several reasons, not the least of which is that I can now (well, when the season starts) view MLB games through my Galaxy Tab Plus without needing to pay for another app!  I get the full slate of MLB games viewable live on any computer through my MLB.TV account, so I can access the games on the home computer, and watch them on my Galaxy Plus....wherever I am and wherever I have a WiFi connection!  This is very cool.  I can even set my Tab on my bedside dock and keep an eye on the games there, without lugging around my laptop.  Obviously, you can use the SplashTop connectivity to your other computers any way you want--this is just an example on how one use benefits me personally.  And yes, it does play stereo sound from your PC to your Galaxy Tab!  Sorry, didn't want this to become a review of a cool app, but using this particular cheap app dramatically increases my utility and use of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.  And now I'm even less likely to drag my laptop around anymore, since I can just access it directly through SplashTop on my Tab, when necessary.There really isn't any obvious downside that I see to the Plus, which in my opinion is worth the extra $100 over other 7-inchers.  Most of the pluses and minuses have been discussed already below, and you should read through them all (as I did).  Maybe not enough ports--when you connect the Tab via HDMI adapter to an HD TV for example, you then have no way to keep it charging while used in that fashion.  I think there is a docking station that allows for this, but not sure.  I have not as yet used the Tab in this fashion.  The Peel remote seems like it could be useful and a nice extra function, but the selection of TV's and DVD and stereo connectivity devices is still very lacking--it couldn't find my Zenith media center with surround sound that I have connected to my 42-inch screen, so I couldn't use the Peel universal remote.  But this app seems to be still in development, so I'll reserve judgment on that for now.  Bluetooth is nice, and have had no difficulty in beaming pictures from my phone to the Tab, even where I have no WiFi, obviously.  I do wish there was a way to tether it to my work computer at the office, for instance (I don't have WiFi there), so I can access the internet that way.  Maybe there is a way to do that--I haven't seen it.Anyway, buy with confidence.  Or wait until the 7.7 comes out.  I'll probably eventually get that one, in a couple of years, and after they iron out any bugs with that new product, but I expect this one to keep me entertained for a couple of years.  And yes, Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus IS getting the Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade--there was some confusion on this when CNET posted that the Galaxy Tab and the Galaxy S line of phones would NOT be getting the ICS upgrade.

I see now that I had forced myself to become complacent with the problem.I use my Galaxy Tab extensively for scheduling and personal management; I have used it for playing audiobooks while driving; for reading ebooks in both epub and pdf format; for surfing the web; for reading and composing email; for taking pictures and video; for streaming music; and for playing games.The available apps in the android market (now known as the Google Play Store) are plentiful and totally satisfactory.  There are apps and widgets for nearly anything.  When I search for a particular type of application I am always presented with many matches from which to choose.  More apps are being added all the time.I would now HIGHLY recommend this tablet to a friend.Frank===== MY ORIGINAL REVIEW - NOW OUTDATED =======================================February 8, 2012I just received this tablet for Christmas. The good: The physical design of the tablet is perfect for my needs. I wanted a tablet that I could read books on, plus surf the web, do email, etc. I found that a larger tablet would be uncomfortable to hold for a long period of time. I also wanted this tablet because it has a MicroSD card slot. The tablet is perfectly responsive, even with a screen protector. It's nice and bright, although I find I have to decrease the brightness when running on battery.And now the bad news. Almost immediately, I began experiencing a problem. When the device goes into sleep mode, it will randomly shut down. TOTALLY. After experimenting I eventually found that pressing the power button for about 15 seconds would restart it. So, sleep mode is somewhat useless. This happens a couple of times a day or more. After researching this issue online, I discovered MANY people having this issue. It has been dubbed \"Sleep of Death\". Unfortunately, Best Buy won't help me so now I will have to start dealing with Samsung. Stay tuned - if I get this fixed I'll update this review.A new problem today - it locked up upon recovering from the \"sleep of death\" issue. It was stuck on the \"Samsung Galaxy Tab\" splash screen. I could turn it off, but it would come back to the same screen. After working with it for about 20 minutes, it restarted - in recovery mode. Luckily most of the apps were backed up to my Google account, so they restored automatically. Not so my wallpapers, other settings, etc. Don't know if this is an isolated problem or not.Pros: Built-in speakers, Bright display, Realistic color, Lightweight, microsd card slotCons: buggy", "Title": "A GREAT TABLET ... now that the OS has finally been upgraded", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jeff Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R2GHE02I6IGWSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 1 - SEPT 2012:They released Android's Ice Cream Sandwich for this device and if the device wasn't nice before it is even nicer.

We put a white noise generator on them (also free) so the kids can go to sleep in an hotel room.This has GPS on it, so we used it to find things as we were traveling.We used it watch Netflix during downtimes and it was flawless - use a dock with HDMI connection to a TV and it is like you are at home.When not traveling I keep this by my chair in the living room to check email and surf the web.on the go, I use this as an e-reader and to check email.The best part of all of this? it is not 9.7\" inches and doesnt cost $599, it has a Micro SD slow and I dont have to spend a fortune on APPS - it is not proprietary and VERY portable.", "Title": "amazing device... great for kids... great to put in my coat pocket", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "The4thDoctor", "ReviewID": "RBBQFTY0OQZDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought the refurbished unit and it came in a white box but the unit looks brand new!

Thereafter, I checked out several products and zeroed in on the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus, which I bought off Amazon a couple of months ago for $349 and am very happy with my decision. The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is fast and although the display is not Amoled, it is pretty sharp - enough for most practical purposes. It is expandable too, which is a big plus for me, so decided on the 16gb model instead of the 32gb one, as expanding space is not an issue. As I write this, I have packed my Tab with e-books, apps, music, movies/TV shows too (on my 32gb microSD card in the handy external microSD slot) and even video-Skype regularly; and it shows no sign of slowing down - kudos to Samsung's proprietary dual-core processor in it!Now, the reasons why I chose the Galaxy, why a 7\" format and also, why a Wifi-only model -Why Samsung?: Their user interface on the native Android platform is the slickest and most intuitive in the market (I have reviewed the competition too). The build quality is also top-notch and feels solid too, without being heavy. As I already own and have used a Galaxy smartphone since end-2010, which I am happy with, I was confident the Tab would be as good or better. Samsung also pack the 7.0 Plus with all the necessary inbuilt software to play/run just about anything you throw at it...comfortably played MKV, AVI files and Flash content without batting an eyelid, quickly opened Office files and PDFs, etc. - all without having to download any app to do so!Why 7\"?: All larger screen tablets, including the mid-size Galaxy 8.9\" through to the Galaxy 10.1\" and the new iPad, feel heavy and large to hold after extended usage - particularly when reading books (I demo'd a few larger tablets) and eventually you will need to use both hands to hold it. In my opinion, the 7\" format is just ergonomically right and can be easily held in one hand, for literally hours, without feeling fatigued...almost like holding a real paper book!Why Wifi-only?: As previously mentioned, I also own a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, which has tethering with 3G, and it is always with me. So, a Wifi-only tablet (rather than a Wifi+3G one) that connects to the internet through my smartphone on demand, more than suits my purpose - I can be connected to the internet whilst indoors and on the move too. This combination also does away with having another mobile data connection to pay for!I initially had my heart set on the Galaxy 7.7\" with the SuperAmoled Plus screen, but it was not available at the time of my purchase and also, the 7.7\" was indicated at almost twice the price! As technology progresses, prices are bound to drop. However, at the moment, I still see no other tablet in this form factor and product quality, which gives you better value for money than the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. So, if you have the $350 ready to spend on a neat and powerful tablet, look no further :-)Remember to pick up a 32gb or 64gb microSD card for those large video/audio files, a screen protector and finally, a leather case...to complete the set.Firmware is still at Honeycomb 3.2 but I hear there may be an Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 update available soon...Samsung will advise over the air.PS: After seeing my 7.0 Plus Tab, my wife also bought one for herself - though her application is more for work use. She, therefore, bought the Wifi+3G version, as her work phone is a Blackberry and has no tethering!

I love my iPod 4G Touch, but my single old eye is getting older. It was just getting too difficult to make out a lot of the tiny text and graphics. I had to get a bigger screen. However, I've played with iPads and other 10 inch tablets, and for my own liking, they are too large. Also, I wanted Flash. I was tired of not being able to visit web sites using Flash. This is a great mid-sized tablet. Easy to use, easy to set up. In fact, the user guide is just a tiny little few-page pamphlet. If you've ever used a smart phone, tablet or iPod touch, you'll have no major negative issues using this one. You'll have to decide for yourself if the size is right for you. The screen resolution is good, but it could be better. If it had something like retina display, that would be more up to Samsung's standards. I did at first have a bit of trouble with some of the on-screen buttons. It seemed that a few of them needed to be hit a bit high up, above the actual button, but maybe that's just my poor vision, or maybe it's me adjusting from my iPod 4G Touch, I'm not sure. Battery life isn't quite what I was hoping - similar to my iPod. I was expecting longer battery life. Samsung built in a lot of apps, so look at the ones already there before you go hunting for apps. Chances are, it's already there, but no shortcut is on the desktop. Skype works just fine with this Samsung model, even though it's not on their list of approved hardware devices. It has a faster WiFi data rate than the iPod - nearly twice as fast. The cute little IR app they have for using the unit as a remote control for your audio and video equipment, Peel, worked fine for a little while, but now it just shuts off the television and stereo. Even then, it still works great as an interactive TV viewing guide! I think its IR capability is the \"Plus\" in the model name. A few real nice things to mention: the included Polaris Office suite can read and write various versions of MS Office file types for Word, Presentations, and Excel. Also, the unit reads PDFs and most other standard file types with no problem. A button at the bottom middle has some of the more popular utilities you might want to use; Task Manager, calendar, world clock, \"Pen Memo\" notepad, calculator, and music player. The Task Manager is great! You can readily see all running programs, individually or collectively shut them off, and you can even clear RAM. The \"Pen Memo\" accepts on-screen finger-tip writing. Very nice for quick notes. Easily sets up apps like Yahoo and Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Samsung's app store has most every Android app you could imagine. The music player took me a while to get used to. I'm still finding strange buttons that do weird things there. The cameras are great - very high resolution for a tablet. Good video, too. This is a great unit for video chatting. System control buttons on the bottom left are; Back, Home, Multi-task, and Screen shot. Buttons on the lower right are for running tasks, information, and an information tab that opens up to show tons of needed data such as controls for WiFi, Notifications, GPS, Sound, Auto-rotation, Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. This window also shows time, date, power (percent charge), WiFi source, music player, weather, and more. Between the Task Manager and this information tab, it kicks butt on the iPod for utility, system control and ease of use. I wish it had the ability to create desktop folders! To make up for this shortcoming, there are literally FIVE different home screens! You can customize all of them with widgets, apps, and shortcuts. But five home screens is a drag. I want to create folders, and have just one home screen. Great tiny little stereo speakers are on the bottom, with standard stereo 3.5mm audio output jack for headphones or external speakers. Volume rocker is nice. Power button could be set a bit lower; I accidentally hit it now and then due to its close proximity to the corner while handling the unit. Manual and auto brightness has a good level range. Overall, considering why I bought it, the tablet does what it's supposed to do. The fact that it has front and rear cameras and a microphone keeps me from having lost any capabilities I had on my iPod. Something like a Kindle Fire might be nice, but since it can't even keep up with an iPod Touch, it certainly wouldn't be able to come close to matching the features of this unit. Thus, the price difference. If you don't need things like SoundHound, Shazaam, HD video and audio recording, photography, video chat, or any of that other great A/V stuff - get something less. But if you want a great little mid-sized tablet, this is definitely one to consider. With over 400,000 apps available, and so far, all the one I have downloaded are free, how can you go wrong? Samsung needs to read this review to make a few improvements. A better (i.e. higher-res) display and the ability to create desktop folders would be nice improvements. And, please move the power button down off the corner! No matter, I'm still very glad I bought it. I also bought the Poetic leather travel case for it - right here at Amazon.

Turned out to be perfect for throwing into my purse, though.  The camera's a nice quality - both of them.No real complaints as far as power performance goes, as long as I've got a stable internet connection, the browser is fine.  If it's unstable though, after about 15 minutes, it'll reset and you'll likely have to reenter any passwords/log in info, at least that's the way it acts when I'm on campus.  Not the developer's fault, more my stupid school's.The samsung website won't let me register my unit either, so I have to keep a good eye on it - if someone takes it it's gone.  It also has trouble opening documents from my school website.  I'm thinking I'm going to have to replace the headphones that came with it - they seem defective.  The ear-bud that is attached to the remote (maybe a microphone too?  Haven't tried it out that way yet, and I admit a lazyness to read all the info) is becoming really hot, I picked it up and dropped the ear-buds in surprise, I'd be afraid of burning my ear before too long.  Too bad, really good sound quality - when I used them with my computer monitor, I could barely tell they were in compared to not using them and going by my speakers.For the computing and gaming performance, I give it 5 out of 5 stars, but it's the small things that just bring it down.  Samsung's a tech company - tech and software go hand in hand, so they need to get a hand on being sure that people can register their items and be reassured their name and information is connected to their device in case of theft.  They're supposedly a good name for entertainment hardware, so I'm really disappointed about the ear-buds - amazing sound quality, but mine are unsafe for use.  If you're getting this for use with children, I'd suggest letting the ear-buds 'age' a month or two, I'd hate to see any burned fingers or ears.

Seeing as I like to read ebooks, this was a selling point. I also own a NOOKcolor (which also has a 7-inch screen), and the Galaxy Tab is both lighter in weight and smaller on measures of all dimensions (length, width, and height). The cameras are both good quality; they take good pictures and video for chatting, considering general home use.Software: The tablet is running Android 3.2 (Honeycomb), which was made specifically for tablets. Samsung also inserted their custom user interface \"TouchWiz,\" which consists of some added features (like an extra tray with quick apps) and a few pre-installed apps. While I'm a fan of the \"pure\" Android experience, I found TouchWiz on this device to be unintrusive. Slight customization and it's like TouchWiz doesn't exist, anyway. An upgrade to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) would be an improvement, and is one that I hear/hope will happen, but it certainly isn't necessary for a positive user experience. [UPDATE: The device has been updated to Android 4.04.]Value: At a cost of roughly $380 (purchased as a Lightning Deal), the tablet was quite the deal. The current price is listed on Amazon at $450, which seems about right for what you're getting.Overall: This tablet is highly recommended for people who plan to use it to browse the internet, check email, listen to music, read ebooks/documents, and watch videos. It is also highly recommended for Android fans like me; it provides a lot of options for customization and Google integration. (My sense is that Apple users will probably prefer devices running iOS, like the iPad, based on their own preferences and what that platform offers.) This isn't a computer replacement device, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus makes certain daily activities more enjoyable and convenient.

Their phones and tablets (and TVs) have been nothing short of amazing. And the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is no exception.Despite the similar weight and measurements to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0, the Plus is a completely different tablet. The bulky and squarish designs are gone. The Plus now resembles the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which is still the best looking Android tablet in my opinion. It's very light and thin. The screen is fantastic with the right amount of saturation and contrast. Very responsive as a touchscreen as well.A big bonus is the Infrared Transmitter which transforms your tablet into a great all-in-one remote with the right software. I tried Samsung's pre-installed software and while it does work great, it's a bit slow. Perhaps there are better alternatives on the market.So we know the Plus is a great tablet, but is the operating system up to snuff? Well, yes and no. It's running Honeycomb, so at least we're not using an antiquated phone OS on a tablet. Everything's in high resolution as it should be. However, HC is not Ice Cream Sandwich. There's no support for hardware acceleration. At times, the OS can be quite sluggish and unresponsive. The good news? This can be easily fixed with an ICS update from Samsung. The bad news? Samsung are well-known for their poor and slow update roll-out. It's been over half a year since ICS was officially released and their flagship devices (AT&T; GSII, Galaxy Tab 10.1 etc) are still waiting for an update. Yes, it will come, but might still take a while.Another big question is whether or not anybody should still buy this tablet now that there are cheaper alternatives? Maybe... The Kindle Fire and Nook are in in a different class since unless you're willing to hack your devices, you won't get a true Android experience. They also lack GPS and expansion slots. Now the only available competitor is Samsung's very own Galaxy Tab 2.0, which is at least $50 cheaper (I actually got my Plus for $270 so it's not really a big deal). Even if the price difference was minimal, I think I would pick the Galaxy Tab 2.0 this time around. Why? It comes with ICS out of box. That is its selling point. ICS is just so much better than any previous Android release. That being said, if you can pick up the Plus for less than the 2.0, it's still a great deal. The Plus is slightly lighter, and slightly faster processor. ICS update WILL come.OVERALL: 4 stars! 5 had Samsung released ICS sooner.", "Title": "Great hardware.

It's the only wifi device I own that I have any trouble with. When I contacted Samsung, they suggested I adjust the settings to a static IP.

The battery usage meter says \"Android OS 77%.\" I can turn off wifi, bluetooth, GPS, autosync, etc., but I can't turn off the OS. The battery even drains completely when it's turned off.Samsung's solution was to uninstall all my apps and re-install one at a time to see if one of them is causing the problem.

I am absolutely thrilled with it - another one batted out of the ballpark by Samsung.  I owned the 2010 Galaxy Tab and sold it because it was disappointing - thick, heavy, crude looking interface, low-quality display (I had the wi-fi version), you-name-it.  The 7.0 plus is a drastic improvement - truly beautiful display and is is much thinner and lighter.  Besides the display - and faster processor - I think Honeycomb is at least an order of magnitude better than the old version.  It is fast, the apps - especially e-mail, are better organized and run very quickly.  I haven't tested all of my game apps yet - but Plants vs Zombies runs very well and it runs faster on the 7.0 Plus than it does on both of my 2010 Android phones.  Truth be told - there are a couple of things which I don't like though.  First - Samsung has stuck with their proprietary connector.  Some might say - so what - Apple uses a proprietary connector too.  But, you can find an Apple connector in many, many different stores - not the case with the Samsung cable/connector.  And, for a device costing as much as this, I am disappointed with the rear-facing camera. Come on, Samsung, the *Phone had a 3.0 megapixel camera in 2009 - here it is almost 2012!!  Last but not least, GLONASS GPS support is becoming more common - the 7.7 Plus (if it ever comes to fruition!) will have GLONASS support but the 7.0 Plus does not.

That is the biggest plus I can give to the Galaxy Tab 7\" plus.  This tablet size rides between the large, clunky 10\" tablets, and the large phone segment, and at this size it is perfect for browsing/reading in portrait, yet functional and complete in landscape.  If you have larger hands, which I do, then you can easily thumb type the landscape mode on this keybord with both thumbs.  The screen size is perfect for watching movies, and it still fits in your back pocket (although it sticks out the top).  I also like the interface wrapper that Samsung has put on this device, making it easy to navigate and take care of widgets.  There are also no problems with power on this thing as it has enough processing power to handle your needs.  Now...with all that said and the notion that this thing resided in the realm of ipad killer..I must say what I feel is lacking.  The android software is still not ready for the tablet market, or in my opinion the phone market.  Yes, I am an Apple supporter, but I have spent time with both OSs.  I owned an iphone 3G, then the original Droid slider, and now an iphone 4S.  What keeps me with Apple is the fact that the interface is very consistent, the programs interact with the interface in a very common manner, and everything works seamlessly.  Android, with its openess, invites variation and clunkiness.  Programs crash, some things are not intuitive, and sometimes things just look bad.  Forunately Samsung's interface makes up for some of this, but there is still some left to be desired.  The android market is also void of most of the great programs available on the itunes marketplace.  All I can say is that if anyone finds a way to port iOS onto this thing, I am there in a heartbeat.  If Apple came out with a 7\" tablet today, I would be there.  This is the form factor, it is powerful, and it deserves a better OS experience.  Still, with that said, this is a great product as it is now, and it has earned a 4* rating.

It still has higher specs then the Galaxy tab 2 7 inch, and the Galaxy tab 3!  Samsung updated it to Android ICS, and I was looking to by a newer tablet, a Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch, or a Nexus 7. It is more powerful then the Galaxy tab 3, the only advantage of the Galaxy tab 3 seems to be it is a bit lighter, which is better for reading books, and for watching net flix movies. Also the newer Galaxy tab has usb instead of propriety. This tablet has the sturdier aluminum back instead of the plastic back, and it has better camera. considering the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus is so powerful and durable, I will not be upgrading for now. It is a fantastic tablet. If you find a good sale I say buy it!The Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus is my first tablet. I love it! I rationalized buying this for saving money on college books. It can use all forms of e-books that I'm aware of: Google Play books, Kindle, and the Barnes and Noble one. It came with 5 free books! and I bought a Zondervan red letter edition King James Bible for $4.00! I down loaded an Adobe Acrobat reader that works flawlessly. The nitty gritty is this a refined and powerful hand sized tablet. Powerful in that it is fast with snappy dual processors! You can watch Netflix movies, that look great. The Google apps store has thousands of free, and inexpensive apps. The battery lasts a long time. The wi-fi works great. And you can add a mini sd card of extra memory.The only draw backs I can think of: Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich hasn't been available for upgrade yet. (April 27th 2012) and it's a little expensive.

I have played around with other tablets but this is the first one I've owned and will review it based on that.While I have seen the convenience of owning tablets in person now, I've never wanted to spend too much money on something that is neither too portable to be a phone/portable media player nor large enough and lacking features to be a full-on computer. A week or so before the keynote for the iPad 3, this one got to a sweet spot of $300 that I found was fair enough. The price has gone back up ever since though.The Galaxy Tab 7+ has an amazing size that makes it portable enough to carry around pretty much everywhere you go. Not sure if you have giant pockets but at least your backpack, handbag or maybe even just holding it with a fancy, discreet case will do. And yet the screen is still big enough to enjoy all your media. The tab has a perfect weight too. It feels heavy enough to not feel cheap and fragile, though still you don't want to drop this one. Better get a case for it asap.The tab has great features that make it ubber versatile, such as Front and rear cameras so you can take pictures and do video-calling, led Flash, Flash support on web browsing, microSD card slot for memory expansion, and more. It's great for playing music, videos, web browsing, playing games, messaging and pretty much all the Android Market.. sorry, Google Play store allows you to do.Most of the flaws that I have found with this tablet are more software than hardware related, which is both fortunate and unfortunate. I don't know what it is, but Samsung keeps releasing Galaxy hardware everytime someone in Korea sneezes, but they have their Android OS updates all messed up and neglected. Honeycomb is great and all but I somehow feels that is buggier and is lacking features from Gingerbread. Not that these can't be fixed, but I don't see the intention to do so really. And sadly, one of the features I was looking forward to using the most, the IR sensor built in the tablet, is practically useless not because it actually isn't useful, but rather cause there are NO good apps to take advantage of it. I mean Peel gets promoted as it was great and all, but its not. It sucks.So yeah overall this tab is excellent. It will run many apps very smoothly and its a perfect size to take everywhere with you. If only the Android OS got the updates it needed on time, it would be even better. And also, I wouldn't pay too much money for it. The 2nd Gen of Galaxy Tabs is already coming out and while spec wise they aren't too different at all, I would still not pay that much for this one.

Now I am a little sorry I didn't wait, but perhaps this is the fate of anyone who jumps into a market that is being flooded with new releases from many manufacturers.  I won't go into a long or technical discussion of all of its features; that is already well-covered in various reviews and forums.  I did do my research before buying, and at the time this was one of the best-reviewed tablets out there.  I had my heart set on a non-propietary Android tablet that had access to the Android market.  I wanted to be able to read, watch shows, and explore the world of apps on a high quality device that would provide a minimum of 2-3 years of service.  The Samsung Galaxy tablet seems to do well in all those categories.  So I will just share a few observations about this device, some of which will hopefully be helpful.- The touch screen is very responsive, and image quality is very satisfactory.- I came fairly close to getting a Nook and rooting/unlocking it, which a friend of mine had done, but decided to put down some more money and not risk damaging the machine and voiding the warranty.- I am not happy with Samsung's support.  Shortly after getting it, I was told to update the firmware, but in order to do this, Samsung sticks you with some spyware.  Is there somebody out there selling Android devices and apps that are free of spyware?  If so, they are laying low, and I can only guess that the public has agreed to play along in order to enjoy the many benefits that Android systems offer.  The last time I decided to cave in and let them spy on me, but the update did not take.- I don't use the thing as much as I thought I would.  It is most useful to bring along when I am going out of town.  I don't particularly like using it on trains and buses, or carrying it around in a shoulder bag or backpack, due to the fact that I spent around $400 for it, and would not like to see it get lost or stolen.  It has not put an end to my reading of magazines and books, or watching television, or using a desktop computer.  For me, the smartphone has been a more revolutionary device, since it does everything a tablet does, and also makes telephone calls and sends text messages, and it fits into a pants pocket.  Now if the price for reliable service would only drop a little... But the tablet is basically a big smartphone that you can't call anybody on.  I have not tried using it for video chat yet, but I would like to.- Wifi is often a hassle.  For some reason it seems to have problems finding good wifi and remembering passwords.  It can take several tries to get it working, but before you reach that point your attention may be wandering.  I look forward to the day when cheap, metered data plans are common, or free wifi is easier to use.- If anyone has comments / ideas / suggestions for me or wants to share their Galaxy Tab experiences with me, then let me know.

Found myself having to charge it quite often.  I put it in power saving mode and accepted the dimmer screen in order to save on battery-life.  Grew close to this tablet.  Using it became part of my daily routine.A couple of days ago, I turned on my tablet and there was red \"x\" and lightening bolt on the battery icon.  I clicked \"settings\" and then \"battery\" to see what it was.  It said it was charging when it wasn't even plugged to the adapter to be charged (I use the adapter that came with the product to a wall outlet).  I did numerous searches on this and grew aggravated because there was little on this.I kept running into so-called fixes for a Galaxy Tab phone and the battery needing to be replaced!  It is not a phone, it is a tablet.  There is no way for a customer to insert a new battery on this tablet.  I went to the Samsung site to see if there was anything on this in Troubleshooting.  There was nothing.  I spoke to a Tech via Chat on their page and that wasn't helpful at all.  The tech was friendly, though. She suggested I do a factory restore but that meant losing all of my pictures.  She said I wouldn't but when I was about to clear All data a warning window came up saying that I was indeed going to lose all files. So, I did NOT clear all data.  Aren't techs suppose to know this?!Then I thought about mailing the tablet to their service center (the nearest service center is in Texas. I am in NY)...but I saw complaints about that (hacking into personal accounts.  tablets being returned with even more problems).  This is a new tablet that cost over $400!!!  I am so upset.  I don't want to be charged extra if they assume it is a hardware malfunction. I don't want to lose my tablet.It still works even if there is a red \"x\" and lightening bolt on the battery icon.  Sometimes it says it is charging when it is NOT connected to adapter to be charged. Other times it says it is discharging.  When I do need to charge the tablet, it doesn't make that sound that it, normally, made when it is about to be charge. I miss that sound. I want my tablet to go back to normal!  It is no longer on power saving mode bc the tablet thinks it is being charged.  When I am about to power down the tablet the giant battery icon switches from 100% to 80%, back and forth. It used to just show the amount of batter life left on the tablet with out switching like that.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know if my tablet is slowly dying.

Honeycomb is great, but it needs to be even more customizable in my opinion.

The galaxy tab plus is the PERFECT size to play games, but there are very few of legitimate ones compared to the Apple games.  Live wallpaper is pretty cool - my favorite being the matrix and the cosmos background.  Youtube also has some quirks - every time you change the screen orientation, the video restarts, which is annoying.  Also,  full-screen mode for a youtube video has a single horizontal orientation (with the samsung logo on your right side),  so if you happen to be holding the tab with the logo on your right,  the video does not flip itself,  mildly annoying.  Hopefully Ice Cream Sandwich will prove to be an improvement.Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet.  The 7-inch is the \"sweet-spot\" between the smartphones and the full-size tablets.  Samsung has created a solid product that rivals the Apple line.  I just wish that there are more available cases for this little gem.", "Title": "Perfect-Sized Tablet for Entertainment,  Needs Ice Cream Sandwich to make it even better", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Author": "Dianne L.
