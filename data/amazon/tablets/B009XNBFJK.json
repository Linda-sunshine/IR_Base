{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Christopher Lee", "ReviewID": "R18E75K7O4OKZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I begin, the tablets that I can compare the Surface RT to include the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (from stock Android 3.1 Honeycomb to Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, and all firmware versions in between), the ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue) (with its ASUS Transformer Pad Mobile Dock TF300T (Blue)), the Asus Google Nexus 7 Tablet (8 GB) - Quad-core Tegra 3 Processor, Android 4.1, the HP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, and the Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White).  Believe me, I know (and love) my mobile.  Now for the part of the review you actually care about-- the tablet.PROS+ Build quality.  The VaporMg finish definitely feels-- and looks-- extremely classy, and this tablet feels great in the hand.  Think the aluminum used on Apple's products, but with a slightly softer, warmer finish.  The kickstand (designed to be similar to the doors on a luxury car) snaps shut with an incredibly satisfying click, and folds open in a smooth, clear motion.  There's no creak to the chassis anywhere, and the entire package screams quality.  Save for one thing: the Microsoft logo on the kickstand begins to wear quickly, and for no discernable reason.+ Beautiful screen.  The big sticking point for many is that the Surface RT packs a screen with just 1368x768px resolution, which pales in comparison to many flagship Android tabs (typically packing Full HD screens at 1920x1080px, and the new Nexus 10 with the Retina-crushing 2560\u00d71600px) and of course, Apple's own Retina iPads (at a beautiful 2,048\u00d71,536px).  But in my experience, after around 720p the benefits of a higher resolution video or image fall off very quickly on a tablet.  Microsoft's ClearType technology is no gimmick; text looks genuinely impressive on this comparatively low-resolution panel, which negates (at least in part) a huge advantage held by higher-pixel displays.  Viewing angles and color reproduction is spot on, and Netflix looks incredible on the no-letterboxing 16:9 display.+ The kickstand.  As a student, the small footprint afforded by the Surface with its kickstand extended makes it a great desk companion and movie watching aid, especially while I'm at work and my hands are busy.  Some people have likened the Surface (with stand extended and Touch Cover out) as a poor man's laptop, but the kickstand certainly holds its own when it comes to increasing the Surface's versatility.  And yes, it is possible to use the device on your lap-- if you're sitting straight.  Lean forward, and you'll find the device wanting to tip down.  Although, that won't be a huge issue because....+ Reassuringly sturdy connection to the Touch Cover.  The Touch Cover deserves a review of its own, because it's what really brings the Surface into an entirely different league of tablet.  Suffice to say that once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to a tablet where such a useful accessory isn't an option.  But even better is the stiff magnetic connection (complete with a reassuring thunk), which is strong enough to-- yes, I did test this over a bed first-- suspend the tablet by the keyboard, and even surface a considerable amount of shaking around.  For reference, I tried the same using my iPad and the Apple Smart Cover, and while you can suspend the tablet, any real movement and the iPad will just go flying off.+ Ports!  Having a full USB port open for peripherals (which work astoundingly well) lets you really expand the device at a moment's notice.  My favorite setup is to use a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 - Graphite with my Surface, eschewing the tiny touchpad on the touch covers for a real, solid mouse.  You also get HD video out (to HDMI or VGA, though this requires an adapter), a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, and SDXC expansion (located behind the kickstand) to satisfying your storage and ease of access needs.+ Software.  Of course, this tablet is going to be made or broken by Windows RT, and in my belief, it's...made!  Windows RT is by far and away the best tablet operating system I've used so far, and you can see for yourself up top that I've dealt with a lot of them.  Windows RT allows for \"true\" multitasking in a way that Android (the closest competitor in terms of multitasking; iOS' implementation is glorified window switching, and webOS on the TouchPad still only allowed one application to be seen at once) cannot.  Being able to run two apps on the screen isn't anything new to a desktop user, but Microsoft absolutely nailed the implementation on the mobile front.  You really have to check out a video; my review can't do this feature justice.  The interface is clean, sleek, and performs great-- one reason Microsoft limited the resolution was to ensure that the processor (the formidable A9 nVIDIA Tegra 3) could run everything at speeds and smoothness rivaling anything iOS and Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean can toss out.  Apps function as you'd expect, and altogether everything really comes together.Did I mention Office?  Last week, I decided I wanted to get some work done on an economics project, so I flipped out my Surface, popped the stand and keyboard, and got to work.  I was halfway through crunching some large datasets in Excel when I realized that with any other tablet (including the keyboard-equipped Transformer TF300T, in my opinion the closest rival as a \"productive\" tablet), I would not have even considered trying to work with a spreadsheet.  It's a miserable experience.Built in apps like Internet Explorer 10 work without issue, and unlike other manufacturers, Microsoft lets you uninstall almost ANY application you want-- an enormous and refreshing change of pace.  Don't like XBOX Music?  Games?  Video?  Gone, gone, and gone.  Don't like the default Mail app?  That can be gone too (though it'll take Messaging and People with it).  The list goes on and on and on.  Multitouch gestures are worked in in thoughtful, genuinely useful ways, and you will hate going back to another tablet once you realize that some sensible, convenient shortcuts are now lost to you.Oh, and the People app-- great way to check Facebook if you're only in it for casual use.+ Full filesystem access.  If you ever need to work with files, you'll know precisely why this is important.  No more chasing files all over the stupid tablet, then finding you can't cram them into your app of choice no matter what.+ Overall polish.  It's weird, because Windows RT still has some bugs of its own, but...the Surface as a whole is incredibly well thought out and executed.  You'll sit there thinking, \"if only this tablet could do x,\" then find that it's quite capable of x, y, and z.  And then you can appreciate the work that someone, somewhere put into making this a useful device.CONS- (Update: That I forgot to include this initially should indicate how much of an afterthought cameras are on tablets) The cameras on this tablet are utterly forgettable.  The front-facing one is good enough for a video call, but the rear facing one takes pictures that look like something out of the very first smartphones.  The saving grace is the built-in inclination, which positions the camera at a perfectly flat angle when the kickstand is out.  It's not hard to use in your hands either-- if you can take people laughing at you.  The TF300T has a much better camera, although it's just as bad in low light.- Speakers are weak.  They sound nice enough, and you get decent stereo separation, but there's no beating around the bush-- these things are soft, even for me.- Browser lock in.  Unacceptable.  Internet Explorer 10 is better than I thought it would be, but Chrome bookmark sync and the interface are must haves.- App selection is still a little weak.  I don't think this is a huge issue, as I've found everything I need from the web, Office, and some very, very good apps already in the store (such as DLNA streaming via Multimedia 8), but some big hitters are missing; others, like Evernote are in reduced functionality modes (inability to edit rich text, for example).- Terrible power plug design.  I don't mind having a wall wart charger if it charges the machine quickly-- which it does-- but the magnetic attachment has nothing on the MagSafe adapters used on Apple's laptops.  They should have gone with a plug on this one.On the whole, this is a product that can really pull its own weight, and you owe it to yourself to give Windows RT a shot if you're new to the market-- or even if you're a veteran of the ongoing mobile wars.  I'd be happy to answer questions, and I will continue to update this review as time goes on.Just to be clear: I preordered this fellow from the Microsoft store, and I recommend that you'd do so as well.

All in all I think MS is now very well positioned to compete with iPads and Android tablets.I also wanted to comment on the price of this product.This product sells for $499 in the Microsoft store, and it is unfortunate that Amazon is allowing the re-seller to sell at a price that is significantly higher than Microsoft's MSRP.When they additionally claim that the list price is $999 and that there is a saving of 43%, it becomes a more serious issue. Amazon is here transmitting a statement that is incorrect and misleading, and could potentially be interpreted as fraudulent by a court of law. It should be expected that many people will purchase this product with the belief that they are saving money, when they are in fact paying significantly more than they should. Amazon could at a later time face legal complaints, for example alleging that Amazon benefited financially from false and misleading price information, knowingly and willfully permitting re-sellers to provide false or misleading price information on the Amazon website for the purpose of mutual financial gain, obtained on the basis of financial losses incurred by Amazon customers. Based on the large number of similar misleading prices in different Amazon product categories (see for example DSLR cameras), it should be clear that Amazon could face very significant financial claims, if either groups of customers or government agencies decided to pursue legal action in this matter.Amazon, please immediately put a stop to all instances of price gouging on your website, and communicate to your re-sellers that they should provide correct information with respect to the MSRP of products for sale.", "Title": "Great tablet - Beware of price gouging and incorrect claim regarding list price and savings", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Author": "Brennan", "ReviewID": "R38JLQKCFS271J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this directly from Microsoft, and not from Amazon.The Surface itself is flawless. The touch keyboard is a feature unrivaled by any other tablet and I can't think of any products I will have to buy besides this one to make my Surface more usable. The kickstand is a great feature for being built into the tablet. The only problem with the kickstand is the angle when on your lap. Every other time it is the perfect angle, and that's more important anyway, IMO.Windows RT is almost perfect. The multitasking is brilliant and I've been able to do almost everything I wanted without ever thinking about loading times... I just click and it's there. There are some slip-ups though that I assume will be fixed eventually, namely: The Music app itself, which came with the tablet already, is very buggy and crashes often. Very unpolished but there are other apps for music if it becomes a big deal. EDIT: They have updated the Music app and it is now problem-free. Thanks Microsoft! Also, flash only works on pre-approved websites. So, say you're like me, and frequent a forum that allows for embedding of YouTube videos, you won't be able to click the video unless it's a common forum that Microsoft has approved. It's not a huge deal, but it's noticeable. You can't see battery life until you go to the desktop and do it as you would on a Windows-based PC. This also doesn't give you an estimated battery time though, just percentage. IMO, RT should be able to handle something like that. I shouldn't have to go to the desktop for anything....Except Office, which is understandable since it will be the same office between multiple platforms and I understand. It works very well with the touchscreen and Excel is finally usable on a tablet. I've run versions of Excel on various touchscreens before and it's never been this great.I have used the Remote Desktop as well, and it pairs brilliantly with my laptop also running Windows 8 Pro. This allowed me to get on Spotify since it isn't available for Windows RT yet.Every app except Music has worked very well for me. The interface that is pretty much integrated into 90% of the apps that I've tried is absolutely gorgeous and unlike anything I've seen on the iPad or Android applications. In effect, it never feels like I'm entering a new app. It just feels like I'm on my one Surface and it has a multitude of things it can do itself. I don't know if that explanation does it justice, but really I never feel like I'm leaving one app to go to another. It never enters my mind.IE 10, the browser used on RT, is very fluid and very fast, but I do like choices. I don't even think I'd choose anything else... but I'd like choices. Speaking of choices, though, if you want to delete virtually any app that was preinstalled with the device, go ahead! It lets you! And then you can turn around and download it again for free out of the store if you miss it. This is a feature that should be in every single operating system, and it's ridiculous it has taken this long.In conclusion, the Surface device could not have been designed any better, period. Windows RT will take some fine tuning, but it does overall seem incredibly polished, enough for me to give it a 4/5. The app selection feels small, but then play with an iPad and ask yourself exactly what you're using that isn't on RT. I can think of some small things, but nothing that I'd use a lot except Spotify, which is the only app I'm really missing right now. Everything put together I'd give it a 4.5/5, but I can't do halves on Amazon. I don't think it deserves a 4/5 because I've never been this happy with a large purchase that I've made. So, 5/5 it is.I hope that gave enough information. If you have any specific questions, ask away. I tried to refrain from being redundant on some features because they're easily found on other reviews on the page, but if you still have questions beyond the other reviews I'll be happy to answer them.", "Title": "Surface is perfect, Windows RT is almost there", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "CAH", "ReviewID": "R3TOC5BVKL2OQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT UPDATE as of November 28:The FULL version of MS-Office is now available for download.  Go to the \"Control Panel\" in the Desktop folder (accessible via the desktop file manager).  Click on \"System and Security.\"  Then choose \"Install optional updates.\"  There you will see the full update to MS-Office, which runs much quicker, I've found.--------------------------------------------------------As a college professor, I rely heavily on programs like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  I also have to juggle multiple email addresses--one for colleagues, one for students and, when time allows, a personal account.  Because I often like to use coffee shops as my office, I've owned numerous portable PCs over the years--from laptops to netbooks and, most recently, tablets.  In fact, I'm embarrassed to confess that I've owned almost every type of tablet computer that has hit the market--the iPad 2, the Asus Transformer, the Kindle Fire and now the Surface.Before the Surface, I was able to complete some work on tablets, but anyone who owns an iPad or Android tablet (and who is also honest) has to admit that, while they are super in some respects, these tablets offer very little assistance to a person who is hoping to create and edit word processing, spreadsheet and presentation program files.  The reason is because these devices lock a user into apps that only allow 10% functionality of the full versions of the leading office programs.  This, however, is not the case with the Surface.  It comes with a standard office suite, and I have been absolutely amazed at what I can do on this tablet.  Most recently, I was able to grade student papers by inserting comments into the margins.  While this isn't shocking on a desktop, it's unheard of on a tablet.  The share button in the charms menu allowed me to easily send the files back to my students.  This day of work alone made me fall in love with MS's delightful new Windows 8 operating system.I know.  I've read all the reviewers who poo-poo Windows 8, and they're certainly entitled to their opinions.  Many of these reviews, though, seem to be products of fan-boy hero worship, which tell readers less about Surface and Windows 8 than they do show how dogmatically people defend their purchases and favorite companies.  As a former computer technician, though, I've never been a fan of any company, device, operating system or software that didn't serve my needs, and I've used many over the years.  However, Windows 8--both the full version and the RT version--is the most exciting and useful operating system I've seen in years.  It enables easy multitasking and an easy to navigate experience.  While the value of an operating might be subjective, the fact that work like word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations is easier on the Surface is not subjective, and anyone who has used Android and I-Pad products for work and has also used the Surface can easily attest to this.  It is true that there are limited apps at the time, but those of us who were first on-board with Apple or Android tablets easily remember a similar situation when they debuted.  Still, to be honest, I'm not a gamer, and for my purposes, I have all the apps I need currently on the Surface.In addition to the quality of the operating system, the build quality is outstanding.  This has been noted in almost every review, but it's impossible to really describe how fantastic and solid this tablet is.  Truth be told, I entered the Windows 8 RT world with the Asus Vivo RT but returned it because the bezel didn't line up with the rear casing, and this made it feel a little less than comfortable and trustworthy.  There are no such flaws with the Surface.  In fact, I'm more impressed with the build quality of this product than any other tablet I've owned--including (and I hesitate to mention this because of the hate responses I'm sure it'll garner) the iPad.The one downside to this machine that somewhat amazes me is the screen resolution. It's not bad, but it's not stellar either.  I just cannot imagine why MS didn't simply knock the ball out of the park with a higher res screen.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it is puzzling.All in all, I am very happy with this product, and MS's shipping, packing and presentation were stellar.  Though I've intentionally ignored MS for over 10 years (using Linux and Libre Office at home instead), they've made me a convert--for my home and, especially, my tablet needs.UPDATE:Here are a few extra comments that I made in the comments section that might be useful to those who are simply browsing the reviews.1) If you have multiple email accounts, then the included email app will allow you to add all your accounts to that one app and then simply click from one account to the next when you see a new message has arrived. This works for all email accounts-even MS Exchange.2) The calendar app nicely integrates all your calendars (e.g. Google, MS Outlook) into one calendar and color codes the different sources so you can easily differentiate your work from personal appointments. (REALLY NICE!)3) The \"charms\" bar is also nice because you can share the on-screen information/document easily. Adding it to your online content or simply mailing it off to an email address is only one click away.4) Obviously, having full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet Explorer has many benefits, and the 2013 version of Office is a wonderful upgrade from the previous version. If you want to try it out, MS is letting people download a full trial version of Office 2013 via their site. It's worth a look.5) The new SkyDrive (MS's cloud storage) nicely integrates with all programs.A few downsides1) If you use Dropbox.com, then currently, there is no app for Dropbox. You can use other apps that will allow you to access those files, but they don't allow the easy edit and save that a true Dropbox program does.2) The webcam is acceptable and works well for creating lecture supplements, but if you intend to record high quality videos, then the rear camera leaves a lot to be desired. It's not horrific, but it's certainly not as good as the other tablets I've used.Something to think about: the upcoming version of Surface (non-RT) will not only run a full version of Windows 8, but it will also have a digitizer-which means you'll be able to write with a stylus on the screen. If you prefer handwriting comments on papers/exams/reports, then this might be worth waiting for. You can use a capacitive stylus with the current Surface, but it doesn't offer the exactness of a true digitizer stylus.", "Title": "The Best Tablet I've Ever Owned", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "crimson81", "ReviewID": "R24Q6QSOJFXQYB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Windows RT Surface is a solid product which offers both productivity (Office Suite) as well as entertainment capabilities.  However, there's an old saying...strive to do your very best at the task/job you have before you, etc.  I understand this device offers something different than the ipad and android tablets, but clearly, the developers of the Windows RT Surface didn't spend much time, if any, on the quality of the camera and audio functions. They should have simply put forth a better effort or simply by-passed having a camera function all together.  The clarity of which the camera projects is horrible, to say the least.  I had an old 2004 Motorolla flip-phone that presented a more clear camera picture than this 2012 Tablet...which is quite sad.  The volume is decent if one is using headphones, but without headphones, this tablet lacks the loudness in which a 10 inch device should have.  I have pretty good hearing and i literally have to hold this tablet up to my ear in order to hear whatever is playing, i.e., music, movies, etc.  Other than these two minor flaws, this is a solid tablet, but i returned my Windows Surface RT and will more than likely wait til the second Windows Surface RT is released.Prostouch cover is a very nice additiongood picture (excluding the camera)good for getting work done via word, excel, powerpointusb port, vga capability (adapter required)consweak volumecamera is horrificlack of apps (that should change eventually)", "Title": "Solid Device", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Arif", "ReviewID": "R1Q45VDTMQ8UVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to start off this review by noting I am a College student who owns a Macbook, and a Windows PC.  Also, its worth nothing that I considered buying a Ipad, but the $600+ price range scared me away from that, so I settled for the Surface RT (after seeing Microsoft's commercials that put it up against an Ipad) instead. It is the best purchase I made in a long time and I wrote a very comprehensive HONEST review for anyone who might be considering buying this product. I bought this directly from the online Microsoft Store.  With a student discount for buying it using my .edu email, it cost me only about $340 after Taxes and shipping. That is my first compliment on this product, it is a VERY affordable tablet for a student on a tight budget.Going on,  my second compliment on this product is its design and its built in features. I love the Kickstand, it makes typing notes in class very easy, if not as easy as when I used to bring my Macbook to class.Thirdly, I want to note that you need to run software updates to fully enjoy this tablet. Running Windows Update will update the tablet to fix bugs and gliches that many other reviewers here on Amazon complained of.  After I ran such updates, I had NO problems with the device (its been 2 months since I purchased it and I have yet to get any freeze ups or crashesThat brings me to the second part of the review, OS and Apps. The OS is very genius if you ask me!  Windows 8 (Or this case Windows RT) is made for Tablets.  Opening the charms bar, closing apps, and multitasking between apps is very easy on this tablet. Multitasking and opening more than one app is also improved in Windows 8.1 update, which is free to download once you fully update the tablet, so I recommend that to be done also.As for app selection, many on Amazon often gripe how popular Ipad apps are not available in the Windows Store for the Surface... Well what do you expect?  As of today, there are more than 100,000 other apps in the store to be downloaded, that substitute Ipad Apps. Facebook, Twitter are also all available.Many also gripe and complain how the Surface RT is not compatible with .exe and other Windows 7/Vista/XP/8 programs. Well, what do you expect? Does the Ipad work with Mac or Windows Programs? NO! It is a TABLET not a COMPUTER. The Surface RT is IN NO WAY MEANT TO REPLACE THE POWER OF A COMPUTER.  It is meant to be mobile, and to be used ON THE GO.The Surface RT is a tablet to get business and school work done on, not to take selfies or to play games on. There is however a small selection of Xbox Live for Windows games that can be download from FREE from the Windows store, such as the classics like Solitaire, and Minesweeper to keep the mind occupied.  There are also many other games that can be downloaded for free. The store is much more updated than it was at this point last year.Back to business now. The Surface RT comes preloaded with Office 2013. Its not as powerful as a FULL desktop version of office, but it gets the job done. Like the title of the review says, I am a Journalism major, and I do A LOT of typing in Word and Office. I found no problems using Word or Office 2013 on my RT.  I found using it fun, as it is specially built for touch controls.As much as I have praised the Surface RT so far... there are some major flaws to this tablet though.  For one, the speakers are very poor quality, and even when the volume is at 100%, I find myself not able to fully enjoy the music as if it were on my computer.  This is somthing that headphones or bluetooth speakers cant fix though.  That also brings me to another gripe, the Music and Video apps that are included with the RT also have Xbox Music/ Video bundled into it, and that makes playing my own music and videos severely annoying, to have to navigate past a stupid store front to play my own music.  This feature can be disabled though, so it is all good.A second flaw can be the devices camera.  The camera is only 1Mega Pixels, which is a joke by modern standards. I did find however that this device shot amazing 720P video.  It picked up natural sounds very well, and did not really lag. But this is a tablet, not a camera, so this should not be a major let down for anyone. A special feature in Windows 8.1 enables you to take panoramas with your Surface RT, and that often increases the quality of pictures, so check that out too!Now, to end this review, I must mention the USB ports of course!  The Surface RT has a built in USB 2.0 port. Any device that would work on a Windows 8 PC basically will work on the Surface RT.  It is best to check compatibility  though, by visiting [...]That also reminds me. The Browser that is included with the Surface RT out of its box (IE10) is very buggy. I recommend running the Windows Updates and this fixes most bugs. After that, I found that IE10 was even better than Safari on an Ipad. It renders webpages pretty quick, and most IMPORTANTLY, ALL FLASH SITES WORK! Unlike the Ipad, WHICH DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH.Over all, this device is indeed an Ipad competitor. It has many useful features that the Ipad lacks, such as an intuitive OS,  a Office Suite. and Internet browser. And best of all it is affordable.5/5", "Title": "A journalism student's honest review....", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bill B", "ReviewID": "R1BUOL26CD9KZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Kindle Fire, iPad 2, iPad 3 and the Surface.  The Surface is definitely the best of the bunch.PROS====-The housing is very high quality, easily the equal of the iPad.  It has a very smooth but slightly grippy feel to it.  It has a nice weight to it, feels substantial.-The keyboard (I have the Touch) is an absolutely fantastic idea.  It's there whenever you need it, and never in the way when you don't.  It works very well, has just the right feel and I got used to it quickly. I can't put into words how much more usable and productive the tablet becomes when you add a keyboard and trackpad.  And add-ons for the iPad are not in the same league, because this whole device and it's apps were built around a keyboard/mouse/touch, so you never feel that they keyboard is just for when you're typing an email.  You can actually use this tablet like a computer when you need to get more done.-The stand.  I can't believe how much this adds to the experience. There are many times with my other tablets that I wanted to prop them up for hands-free movie watching, or putting it on my desk.  I have tried many cases that try to solve this problem, nothing comes close to the built-in stand on the Surface.  It feels very sturdy and high-quality, and it is infinitely more stable than some grooves in a leader case that the side of an iPad is supposed to rest in (good luck with that on your lap on a plane or in bed).-Windows 8.  I love the interface.  It is more intuitive than iOS.  Having a scrollable series of tiles just seems more natural and intuitive than pages of individual icons.  The gestures are natural and intuitive as well, once you learn them.  Swipe from the side to change apps, swipe from the top to close, swipe from the bottom for app options, and swipe from the right for system options.  Very nice design.  The \"live tiles\" are a big step up from solid icons in iOS. Also, if you have Windows 8 on your desktop, the interface and intuitiveness carries over, making the tablet and desktop experiences much closer.  This is great for folks who don't like learning new things (like my parents) who would instantly feel at home with this tablet-The tablet is nice and snappy fast.  There are a lot of little details that count... the different sounds when you hit different keys make it feel like you're really typing on a keyboard and are superior to a single tone for all keys.  The fact that you can use the windows button/logo on the front, or swipe in from the side make it easy to go to the home screen no matter if you are holding it portrait or landscape.-Expandability!  This is huge!  Why pay $200 more for 32GB of memory with 'other' devices when it costs them $20?  I love that I can just plug in a $60 64GB MicroSD card.  I can plug that same card into my PC or my cell phone too - so it's very easy to transfer files.  Also -a full sized USB port - WONDERFUL!  I plugged in a USB flash drive... I can see all my files.  I plugged in a keyboard, works great.  I plugged in my bluetooth mouse adapter - mouse works great.  I plugged in my printer, I can print! This adds so much to the Surface, more than can be put into words.  I no longer fight the device to do what I want, it just has all the functionality built in.CONS====The Surface is not total perfection, of course.  It has some flaws.-The cameras suck.  At least for still pictures...they just don't even come close to the camera in my Galaxy S3.  Probably OK for Skype but you won't want to be taking snapshots with them (then again, do you want to be doing that with any tablet?)-Lack of apps.  This will change over time - some of the main ones are there like Amazon, Kayak, Angry Birds and such.  But some of the apps I use on my iPad aren't... like Imo, Facebook, etc.  I notice that every week, more apps come out (Yelp is out now, as is Skype) - so this isn't a huge biggie, since most stuff you can do through the web (online banking for those who do not have apps yet), but it's an area where the Surface lacks-Lack of accessories.  I guess this is to be expected since it's only a couple of weeks old, but it's unfortunate that there are no aftermarket power adapters yet (I would like one for travel to Europe).  I would also like a cable that attaches my travel power pack to the Surface for movies on long plane rides... but it is not available.  Also, there are only two cases I see available so far, and they are both laptop sleeve looking things.  I would like something that protects the back of the Surface while I use it.  These will come in time.OTHER=====Had to mention the screen.  The screen has pro's and con's.  It is lower resolution than the iPad, which it would be better if higher.  But I never feel it's low when I use it... it's only when you look at the same picture next to the iPad that the iPad looks smoother and more vibrant.  On the other hand, I much prefer the 16:9 format on the Surface.  It makes the on screen keyboard layout better, it's better for watching movies (no letterbox like the iPad).  There is much less glare which is great for planes where you can't always control the light, or for outdoors use.  But I still wish it was higher res... 1920x1080 would be perfect.Overall this is a great choice for tablets.  If all you do with a tablet is surf the web and watch movies, then perhaps the iPad would be better suited, but if you ever want to use it for something more - even simple stuff like sending email, replying to posts on a forum, booking flights online, checking your online banking, using any spreadsheet or word document, transferring files, online collaboration... or if you use it for hands-free stuff like putting it on the counter when you cook using an online recipe and such - the Surface is by far the better choice.At the end of the day, I still own a Kindle, iPad3 and Surface.  I am listing the iPad for sale this week...that says it all.  I decided to do that after barely using it since I got the Surface, and when I did use it, I felt I would rather have grabbed the Surface instead.", "Title": "Excellent tablet - you can do so much with it!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "R1OKOEJDTVCN0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Surface for almost 2 weeks, and the more I use it, the more I really, really like it.  I wanted a tablet on which I could both surf & work, so waited in anticipation of the Surface.  All in all, the Surface has not disappointed me.I purchased my Surface in a Microsoft store, but realize that Microsoft doesn't have many store locations, so here is how I came about deciding that the Surface was the machine for me - someone who wants a 10\" screen, wants to be able to surf the internet & open multiple screens, but also wants to be able to use the Tablet for creating documents & showing them in presentations/meetings:RT versus PRO:There was/is a lot of media ink about RT versus PRO, so I really had to wade through the articles to decide what would be right for my needs.  RT is being called a \"dumbed down\" PRO because it is a contained ecosystem (meaning that you can only download apps from the Microsoft Store & cannot upload anything you want from Explorer).  In the 2 weeks I've been using RT, I haven't found that this is a hindrance to me.  I was able to set up all of my email addresses (gmail, hotmail, roadrunner & a business email from own website) using Outlook 365, was able to set up my wifi printer, and was able to download enough apps to keep me busy for a while.32GB versus 64GB:The Surface uses about 16GB of memory, but each surface has a micro SD slot that will take a 64GB microSD card.  I was told by a Microsoft store employee that apps are saved to the hard drive & can't be saved to the SD card, but I haven't verified this statement.  So, how much stuff do you want to save to your hard drive?  I chose the 32GB version & purchased a colored touch keyboard.The Surface also comes with a standard USB port, so you can insert a flash drive or any other device that requires a USB port.Touch versus Type Keyboard:I tried both the Microsoft Store & the type keyboard felt like a netbook keyboard & the keys moved & clicked when I typed.  The touch keyboard's keys don't move, but there is a sound when you type, so you can react from that.  I ended up choosing the touch keyboard because I wanted a colored keyboard & because I thought that I would get used to the fact that the keys don't depress when I hit them.  My accuracy has gotten much better with practice (I typed this review on my touch keyboard).  The type keyboard is a nice keyboard & there is no break-in time to get familiar with it, and, if you are going to do heavy-duty typing, you'll probably want the type keyboard.  If you are prone to spilling stuff on your keyboard, the touch keyboard fully encapsulated, so it is cleanable & non-penetrable.  The type keyboard, with its push down keys, is susceptible to liquid spills. An additional warranty will cover these types of accidents.Which Color?Want color?  You'll have to go with a touch keyboard.  The black keyboards, both the touch & the type, have a felt-like back that is a dark grayish color. I thought the material might be a major pet hair attractant, so I passed on the black boards (the type keyboard only comes in black, so no choice if you want the type board).White:  it is white, like uniform white.Pink: it is pure pink.  It is bright & more pastel than neon.Blue: it is a robin's egg blue, again leaning towards the pastel spectrum.Red: is more orange than red - think burnt orangeThe Apps:You have to get/purchase your apps from the Microsoft Store.  There has been a ton of ink about the lack of apps in the store, but I have found a lot of free apps that I have played with and still need to explore.  More apps are being added daily, so I'm sure that in no time, the store will have more choices than we'll know what to do with.I use a Windows Phone, so when I set up my Surface & logged into my Microsoft account, all of my Windows Phone settings were caught by the Surface - my phone contacts, Facebook, Camera Roll, Skydrive & Facebook pictures, etc. all came over without any need to do anything but log in (Facebook is under the People's App).The Office Suite products still show in Preview form, but they operate just like the Word, Excel & Powerpoint programs on my regular laptop.  Even though I use a 2007 version of the Office Suite products on my laptop, I can transfer/edit documents back & forth from the Surface to my laptop without a hitch.Internet:What I like about the Surface is that I can open multiple windows when searching/surfing the internet.  It is easy to go back & forth by just pulling down the top of the screen to reveal the open windows.  A new Google search app just showed up, so I am trying that one to see how I like it over the Bing App (the Google search results will show up in a page format, while the Bing results show up in a boxed format.The 10\" Screen:My poor eyes require a 10\" screen, and the Surface screen size does not disappoint.  I can view my screen in landscape & portrait (and from any way I turn the tablet - there is no upside down).  I find the screen resolution to be quite nice & screen glare, thus far, has not been an issue (I've mostly used the Surface indoors).  Critics have written that the Surface screen doesn't compare with the iPad's screen, but I cannot comment on this since I do not have an iPad in order to compare the screens side-by-side (I may do this with a co-worker's iPad & will update if I do).Cameras:The cameras are terrible.  They are good enough for Skype, but that is it.  At least there is a front & back camera. This is my main complaint about the Surface & I think Microsoft dropped the ball on this specification.Speakers:Another downside to the Surface is the speakers are weak even though Microsoft put speakers all around the top sides & top of the tablet.  Unless you are operating in a completely quiet environment that allows you to play your speakers, you will want to find a nice set of headphones.Housing/Shell:Microsoft uses a magnesium alloy shell (VaporMg) material for its case/shell.  It looks and feels high-end.  The built-in kickstand is flush with the body when retracted & easily pulls out and locks into place when you want it.  Thanks to the type/touch keyboard design, you do not need an additional case or storage accessory for the Surface.I use the kickstand when the Surface is on a desktop or table; otherwise, when sitting, I'll either flip the keyboard to the back & use the on-screen keyboard, or, when sitting up in bed, I'll use the extended keyboard to bring the screen closer to face level (fully extended - no kickstand).Help:If you get stuck and need help figuring something out, Microsoft has a Support Tab on its Surface page & it is a pretty decent help site.  And, there is always Google.  If you purchase the additional warranty, free phone help is available.Warranty:The Surface comes with a limited 1 year warranty.  The additional $99 warranty adds another year & fully covers the Tablet & the Keypad.Buy It?If you decide to purchase the Surface, buy it directly from Microsoft.  If there is a store near you, go there.  The Surface is returnable within the first 15 days from purchase even if you have used it.  If you buy it from Microsoft online, you must return it via mail (can't take it back to a Microsoft Store).", "Title": "Functional, Fun, Durable & Gorgeous!

I loved the concept when it first came out, but it was just too expensive for what it was offering.  But fast forward a year later and the prices have plummeted to the point that you have to consider it.  Over the Thanksgiving weekend, you could get these for $199 or less.  But they sold out quickly.  I was able to snag a great deal on a used one online.Whether or not you will like this device depends on the type of user you are.  If you need a system with complex software, you'll need something akin to a real PC.  That means the Surface PRO, which runs the full version of Windows, would be better for you.  The difference with Windows RT--which should be called Windows lite or Microsoft Mobile--is that it's designed for slower processors.  The critics have bashed RT because of its limitations, but you don't hear that same point made about Apple's iOS, which doesn't even allow for true multitasking.  RT is limited because it's meant to be a different product.  Perhaps the poor choice in naming has given it a bad reputation.That said, if you mainly use your computer for browsing, playing music, reading, watching movies, and word processing, the Surface definitely fits the bill nicely.Here are some thoughts on key aspects:FORM -- this is nicely built.  I bought a ASUS netbook several years ago for $500.  They are comparable in size and portability.  But that thing was mainly plastic and cheap looking.  This is a high quality product made of metals.  It looks and feels the part.The new Surface (2) comes with a better kickstand, but I've discovered some neat tricks to give me more viewing angles.  My main trick is to slide my slim smartphone underneath to prop it up slightly.  This does create a slight give with the keyboard, but it's not major.  I can still type comfortably.  However, often I find the regular flat placement of the keyboard just fine, too.  And remember that you'll use this as a hand-held tablet as much as a notebook.  In this manner, I find this to be a great size.  I also have a 8.9 Kindle Fire and that seems a bit too small at times.  I had considered a 13.3 tablet, but, now holding this 10.6 device, I think anything above 11 might be too big for regular tablet use.  You can tell MS thought a lot about the size factor.  In contrast, the netbook was 10.1, but the extra .5 on the Surface does make it more comfortable for viewing.SCREEN -- 720P resolution is not bad on a small screen like this.  I have an older TV with the same resolution (26\") and it's just as good as my bigger 1080P TV.  Resolution is not always that important.  Viewing quality can also depend on the software or program running.  For instance, on some websites, the visuals look stellar and in others not so great.  The new Surface is 1080P but costs a lot more.The other factor here is touch.  I find it responsive enough for me.  But I haven't ever really had too many problems with touch devices.  I find that every machine has slight issues, depending on the program you're using, etc.  Again, it's not always the machine.One thing that I failed to consider is cleanliness.  The screen does seem to get dirty fast.  But it's an easy problem to fix with regular cleaning (a simple wipe off).If you choose to use one of those folding cases, keep in mind that you essentially make the built-in kickstand (one of the coolest features) superfluous.  The tablet needs to be exposed in order to use it.  Since I don't let other people use the tablet, I keep it in a carrying case when I'm done with it.  I don't just leave it around unprotected.SOFTWARE -- the main reason why I gave in and tried the Surface was because no other tablet offered MS WORD.  I teach for a living, so I absolutely needed a portable device that allowed me to work with a full version of WORD.  A mobile workstation that features MS WORD is worth $199 to me.  It also has all the other main MS OFFICE products, too.  I've been really pleased with the 2013 version.  One feature that I absolutely love is the ability to edit PDFs for the first time without any workarounds or extra fees.  I had considered other word processors, but there's nothing as good or universal as WORD.  And I became a SkyDrive user a couple of years ago, so it just made more sense to get a Microsoft product.The App Store, while it's certainly growing, still does look barren compared to Android and Apple.  This might be a problem for you if you're an app-hungry user.  I'm not.  I barely look for apps, and only try them based on recommendations of others.  And I only really use a few regularly.  So while this may be a deal-breaker for some, don't let this potential non-issue discourage you.  I also believe that with the new wave of people buying the Surface, more and more apps will be developed.But you need to consider some controversial omissions.  There are no real Google products (Gmail, YouTube, etc.).  And you can't download another browser currently.  This is not a problem for me.  You can still get to all the Google products online, but not the app version.  And I don't mind Internet Explorer.  It's actually quite clean in the Surface version.A surprisingly pleasant app is Bing News.  It's feature right on the main screen.  It's one of the more comprehensive news apps I've tried.  It may actually be my favorite so far.  It's highly customizable and offers a huge range of sources.  It also reads like a magazine on your tablet.  I probably use this as much as I use the web browser for reading.This new touch version of Windows is not as hard to understand as everyone makes it out to be, especially with the new 8.1 upgrade.  Once you learn the basic tricks of getting around, there's not much to really understand in order to do what you want.  I agree with folks who think it's the best version of Windows.  It looks beautiful and is a nice balance between the simplicity of Apple's iOS and the flexibility of Google's Android.One of the great advantages of RT--despite the many criticisms thrown at it--is that it's a closed system (much like Apple's software).  This means that the chances of getting a virus are highly unlikely.  To me, this added security is actually better than having access to thousands of apps that I'll never use.  So while some people call this closed system a limitation, I think it's actually a benefit to basic users like me.KEYBOARD -- I was intrigued by the touch cover, but I hated it when I tried it.  I couldn't get used to the feel of it, which feels like typing on a fabric board.  I wanted something that felt like real keys, and that's what you get with the type cover, which costs a little more.  I haven't tried the type cover 2, but the main upgrade seems to be the backlit addition and that the keys are supposed to allow for faster typing.  I don't ever type in poor lighting, so I'm not sure how that feature would add anything for me.  And I barely look at the keyboard as I type, do you?  So if you have a choice between the two and there's no price difference, then get the new version.  However, if you can get a good discount on the old version, then that seems like a far better deal.Lastly, I should add that I did consider ponying up and getting the Surface 2, but what are you getting for the extra $200+?  Yes, it's a better machine: faster, better resolution, etc.  However, is it worth it?  Here's how I look at it.  Would you rather have the Surface 2 or the original Surface AND another 7\" tablet (Kindle HDX, Nexus, Venue, etc.)?  Because for the price of the Surface 2, you could easily get yourself two amazing tablets.  Realizing that alone made my decision rather easy.I'll wait for the next great thing that will allow me to fully consolidate my computing devices, but in the meantime the Surface is going to be a nice companion.", "Title": "What kind of tablet user are you?

Allen", "ReviewID": "R1TQI4UCQ63FTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you've read the tech blogs on the Surface RT, you might think that the Surface is a slow, buggy, useless tablet. As someone who's owned and used one daily, I can tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. Most complaints I've read online are the result of unfair comparisons and misunderstanding what this device is.For me, the Surface RT was an iPad replacement + the laptop I would never carry because laptops are too cumbersome. It does everything the iPad did, plus, it does a pretty good bit of what a laptop can do as well. Its windows, so you can manipulated files, print, use a mouse and many other things you are used to in Windows exactly the same way you already know. You have real versions of office that don't screw up your documents and you can run two and sometimes more apps simultaneously for real multitasking.Now, what its not: The Surface RT, or any other Windows RT device is NOT a full powered Windows computer. Its also about half the price tag of an ultra portable, full-powered Windows portable with double the battery life of its full-powered counterparts. So, if you need to run Visual Studio and Photoshop while render HD, multilayer video effects, this is probably going to disappoint you. Windows RT only runs apps from the Windows Store, so you cant load up old windows programs you have on CD. This is true of every ARM powered tablet on the market like the iPad and Nexus. Also, If you are annoyed by some apps taking 2 seconds longer to open than they do on your desktop, this might not be the device for you. If you already use a ARM based device like an iPad or Nexus tablet, you will find the Surface to perform on-par, yet with some pretty cool extras that only come from a device running a full, robust operating system like Windows.The other weakness here is apps. If you enjoy having all the latest and greatest apps that come out for iOS or Android, you might be disappointed that some of the popular titles out there are not available for the Surface RT. I fully expect this to improve dramatically, but that's the state of the union right now. If you're like me and want a tablet for a great web browser, email, messaging, Skype, music and video, facebook, Netflix, Office, etc, then you will LOVE the Surface RT.", "Title": "So much better than tech blogs say it is!", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Derek D. Bergey", "ReviewID": "R2AOOO7UR3YWD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thus far, I can tell you I love the device. I have a kindle paperwhite that I use for reading, and I've long since staved off the purchase of another device. I say another, because in out house we have a Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, Ipad, 2 macbook's and one netbook. (we've since given away 3 of the laptops) So, buying another device that will sit wasn't on my agenda. As a writer, I didn't want something that played fart noises and has a dj turn table, and as a consumer I didn't want something that I could continue to use and upgrade as time goes on.The ipad we have is great, it's a fun toy, we watch movies on it and gal pal uses Medical app's to help with medical school and what not. The app store is vast and that's great but 98% of them are things you'll never use, try or care for. So the lack of app's on Surface was never as daunting as people made it out to be. So here is why I got the surface.Again, writer, wrote a book, will probably write more, actor, often find myself walking around and showing people a reel of myself and trying not to feel silly while doing so. This device comes with Microsoft Word, which sure will be better once I get the keyboard but what people are forgetting, any keyboard will work. Any. You can get the touch or type cover, or you can plug on in through it's provided USB output, or get another bluetooth and then, Shazaam! Keyboard. Speaking of which, it has a USB output. I can transfer stuff on a USB drive, I can plug in an external drive and play all sorts of stuff. Keyboards, all that jazz. I haven't tried it yet, but I am assuming I can plug my camera into it and presto, files transferred, have yet to try that but a USB works just as a USB works. So, there's that wonderful feature. It also works as a monitor thing. I can plug the micro usb into the side and then plug that into my TV. I can then mirror what's on the screen, it can make it so it's half and half and all that. Apparently people who have xbox one and or xbox 360 claim they can't live without it. So, I don't know if they are using this as a monitor of what, but I suppose one could look that up.Not enough space on the 32 gig version, get a 64gig microSD and then BLAMO! 64 gig's. Sitting. Waiting. READY!The 32 gig ipad is now getting the shuffle that comes with limited storage. Throw one to many songs, books, pictures on there and now Grandma who died a few years ago's picture is getting deleted because it was either keep that file or get a new app with a bird jumping around squaking that you'll play for a hot 2 minutes. But with this expandable format, one can infinitely go nuts. If you want to use one card, or many you could. A card for music, movies, pictures and all that. All on one, of 64 gig's of each on different ones'. Given the size of the card, you can easily carry a bunch with you in a tiny case. And you'd feel good about yourself, all the world's knowledge could be at your finger tips. Without having to delete dead Grandma.Now, productivity, yes there is a learning curve. You don't just tap something and go about your day. You can, but once you learn how to use this device it's stunning. Just earlier I had a youtube video explaining something about history (go vlogbrothers) while I searched through photo's on the other half the screen. I was looking over bank information so I can go buy more stuff, while I was watching a show on netflix. I was trying to sync outlook while on the other half of the screen copying and pasting information I would soon need. So, once you get that all down which takes a minute or two of swiping, you are all set.App's load in a few seconds, any of them.Speaking of App's. It has what you need, it has games, (played Halo Assault, good game) (and if I wanted to plug in a controller, I could) it has a bunch of Microsoft app's for free, which if you've ever had Office is unheard of.OneNote.Word.Excel.Outlook.Free.So, take that you silly bird flinging fools. But if games are your thing, there are some. One's that will take a week to beat instead of a minute. Car games, shooting games, and build up a hero games. Some are free, some cost money and all seem to be good.Surface app store is alot like Nintendo versus IOS App store which is like the Atari. If you didn't know, Atari made anything. ANYTHING and it ruined home games. Games glitched, games froze people didn't move and ET never made it home. Then nintendo came along, threw a seal of approval on each game promising it worked. And then presto, people bought games again. Not saying every game is perfect, but the fact that it isn't so saturated you will end up downloading and deleting is a nice thing.Hardware itself.It's long, light, seemingly strong enough for me to hit someone with it and laugh hysterically while I shove handfuls of gummy bears down my yap with my free hand. So, there's that. It's a nice metal body, stretch screen that is nice for reading and playing with stuff. My screen always looks a little less \"pop\" as I don't have it turned up all the way. It I do turn it up, presto looks crisp.Kickstand is nice, didn't think it'd use it until all a sudden I noticed I was using it every time the device was on.Battery last all day, general task and you are good for a long time. I charge mine every two days, use it for internet, youtube, playing around with it and hitting people while eating gummies.So again,Excellent hardware, Excellent software, App's store is growing. Can be used as a drive, doesn't play super nice with google calendar at the moment, but sync's email just fine and dandy.Learning curve is a day or so, but once you get it working it's so easy to do everything. This is as close to a laptop as you can get without going all out laptop.I love apple, I have a super expensive Mac Pro and another super expensive Macbook Pro within feet of me right now, and I went with the surface. In the end, most other tablet's are like playing checkers. It's fun, because right away you get it and you know how to move the pieces around. Eventually, you'll end up playing the same game over and over waiting for a new shiny set to keep you from realizing, it's the same game.The surface is like chess. At first, you have no idea what the horse does and why the triangle one flies diagnolly across the board. And when someone does a \"castling\" you lose it. But then you learn what the knight and bishop do (and what their names are) and the game is expandable, it's ever changing and it's functional. Once you start multitasking and being productive, you see that the stuff you wanted has always been a toy that was only meant to distract, and you can start working on your new book.", "Title": "Chess vs Checkers", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "Marissa", "ReviewID": "R2PLNUWUBG65RH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an incoming college freshman, having a laptop of some sort is basically an essential. Although already an owner to what may seem like a dinosaur of laptops, (considering newer models are issued on a daily), I figured it was time to move on up in the world of technology. Yes.

School was approaching and so was the dinosaur\u2019s way to extinction\u2014not really though, it\u2019s still kicking. Then it hit me. Bam! Just like that. I knew what I wanted. I mean, come on, after watching the commercials, you\u2019d want it, too. Microsoft\u2019s Surface Tablet, I could already feel my fingers tapping and swiping that touch screen. Especially the way it was compared to Apple\u2019s iPad, what a shame. After my purchase, I took this baby home and explored it like no other. Now, let\u2019s talk about why I was sold, and currently still satisfied with my choice but also why I wish I had done some more research.Pros:\u2022 Weight \u2013 What weight? This is something about the tablet that I absolutely love. No longer will you have to carry a cement block around\u2014those dinosaurs for you\u2014for this barely-there-but-not-a-paper-thin-investment will save your back from aches. Not only is it light weight, but it is also extremely portable and easy to take around with you. Would not have it any other way!\u2022 Touchscreen \u2013 Of course if a keyboard is bought, having the touch screen also as an option just makes you love the surface RT even better. I could not be happier that with a quick click in or click out, you can touch, type or even do both!\u2022 Office \u2013 The fact that this tablet comes WITH Microsoft word, Microsoft power point, Microsoft excel, and this new feature called One Note. How cool? Pretty damn awesome if you ask me, you do not have to buy and install it like most laptops or tablets.Cons:\u2022 Keyboard - Although two keyboards are offered, I opted for the touch cover keyboard. Warning! Bad mistake. It\u2019s certainly pretty\u2014a perfect sky blue (one of many colors), but it is horrible, it is the worst, it is nothing I recommend! Hint: get the type keyboard, my sister, who was convinced by my own personal salesman skills, got this one instead\u2014 a wise choice indeed.\u2022 Screen adjustment - With a nice kick out stand, now I say nice, not fantastic. Keep that in mind. For the times you want to adjust the screen, move it up and down like a laptop: forget it, because it is not laptop. I will say it is perfect for any flat surface. It\u2019s no lap dog. Oh no. It is not as obedient as regular laptops.\u2022 Speakers \u2013 If you are alone in your room with minimal noise, then the speakers are fine, but find yourself in a room with the voices of a few others and some possible sounds coming from whatever else, you can ask yourself this: what speakers? Not great. Well, not exactly the best. There is an option for a headphone jack which helps, but if you still want it, which I did, you can buy speakers to plug in. Sacrifices, sacrifices. Tisk, tisk, Microsoft.\u2022 Dual screen \u2013 Whoever thought of this, good job! Whoever made it so you can not adjust the dual screen option so it is not even, not fair tech guy! Not fair. It certainly is awesome, I mean let\u2019s think here, being able to record a video, like I do in class for lectures, while going on Facebook (just kidding!), while typing notes, is pretty damn sweet.", "Title": "Microsoft Surface RT", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "C.

When I decided to buy one, I thought this will be a perfect \"computing device\" for my mom, since she has complained about the weight of the laptop I bought her two years ago, and all she does with a computer are web surfing, Skype, MS Word, MS Excel, and MS Powerpoint.  Even the apps are a bit limited right now, it's never going to be an issue for her.  So I decided to get one when I went down to NJ for a business trip, which happened to be the launch day.First of all, the Windows 8 touch gestures are very useful.  Switching apps from the left is probably the best of all.  I now have tendancy wanting to swipe the left edge of screen on any computer.  Not everything is chrystal clear when you first use it, but if you know to look from four edges of the screen, you'll do fine almost all the time.The kickstand is very useful too.  I personally found it possible to work on my laps, though not everywhere on my laps, only a sweet spot that will have the screen facing me with the right angle.  I actually use itin my couch a lot these days.But if I have to single out one feature that I love th best, it's the touch cover I got.  It freaked me out the first time I used it.  It feels weird, but it works.  For me, not a very fast typer, the accuracy is actully pretty high, not observably worse than a keyboard on my laptop.  It really makes no sense to get a Surface without getting a cover, no matter Touch or Type, therefore the title of this review.  You don't save money by forgoing the best feature of the device.  Also, my Touch Cover makes it a lot easier to navigate through a lot of websites, that are not designed with touch in mind.  It's really nice to have a touch pad handy.BTW, did I mention I can turn the whole thing into Traditional Chinese interface?The best apps come with Windows RT is probably Office.  One of the most common complaint I heard about iPad is the Office support, particularly PowerPoint for presentation.  Surface is particularly strong on this, that I have used it for a presentation, and it worked just fine.The other app I like a lot which is pre-installed with RT is Bing Daily News.  The graphic is great, and youcan easily search news, no matter what you're doing at the moment, by calling up the Charm bar from the right.IE10, epecially the formerly known Metro one, is very impressive.  The touch interface is great, I like the swipe to go back feature a lot, and I also enjoy using the In Private Tab.  Since I got this unit, I have not browsed internet on my 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  It's so much easier on a Surface.  Everything is larger, and you have a touchpad in case the website is really not designed for touch.Mail is among the less stellar apps.  It works most of the time, but there are occasions that links in the mails don't open by clicking it, but need to copy and paste nto the browser.  I find Outlook.com in IE10 a better way to access my old Hotmail account.Among all pre-installed apps, the one I have the most problem with is Xbox Music.  It kind of works with Skydrive, but just barely.  Music on Skydrive don't become part of my music library.  It was nice to see the music I bought from Zune Marketplace automatically downloaded, but unfortunately I also bought a lot from Amazon, and since it's gonna be my mom's in couple months, I don't really wan to transfer all the music over.There are two apps that I'm waiting for, hopefully will get them soon.  One is CNN, the other is Amazon Instant Videos.While the cameras are not high quality, I think they are better than a lot of webcams come with a laptop.  I still don't understand why anyone wants to use a tablet to take pictures anyway.I don't have data to share about performances.  Most of the time it works smoothly, but in some rare occasions, some tasks take longer than normal.  It's kind of weird when that happen, since it's not necessarily a bigger job to do.  Battery life is fairly reasonable.  Charge it when I sleep, and I have not had problem in the days.In general I love this Surface a lot.  Although it was bought to be my mom's, I now think I might want to get another one once I hand it to her, if the coming Surface Pro is priced a lot higher.", "Title": "Don't get one without a cover", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2MMJLMZ2HTX8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is this a good tablet? Not really with my definition of what a tablet should be. iPad is a GREAT tablet, I think they have actually created my idea of what a tablet needs to be, which is light and very usable without a keyboard or stylus, App availability also makes the iPad \"easier\" and more convenient to use. For those who are now fuming because I basically said Apple invented the tablet. Do not be mistaken, I've owned quite a few tablets way before the iPad was even on the drawing board. One of my favorite TabletPC was actually the HP TC1100. I still play with it here and there to this day and STILL love it. Main problem with those told tablets was that they get really hot.With that said, the Surface RT is definitely a great device once you have mastered the features and the way it works, it's a longer learning curve, but don't let that stop you.(I'll start with the cons first). It fails as a good tablet for me because it is really difficult to use well in your hands. For example, I'm a fairly big man, with an iPad in landscape mode, I can type with my thumbs with ease, but the 10:9 aspect ratio here makes this impossible, thus I have to lay it down on my lap. Yes I know you can make the left and right key separate...but now the keys are way too small for my fat fingers! If you want to hold the RT in portrait mode, thumb typing is STILL awkward because of the weight! This thing is so tall that your hands will get tired just trying to hold it upright in this position.The app store is still a wasteland 9 months after the devices was released which means stuff like banking will have to be done from the browser. The kickstand is only useful in certain settings and depending on the surface it's on (no pun intended) touching the screen will cause it to move back slightly. The charger is not your typical USB charger, it is actually a somewhat large (1/3 larger then the iPad 10w/12w charger) power brick. The magnetic connector does not \"pull\"/connect to the tablet's port the way a apple magsafe connector does. So you actually have to look at where it's going, 1mm off and it would pull in crooked and you have to pull it back and try again. I find myself hunting for the port a lot of times. The way the cable is made is also a bit annoying, I find that it puts a lot of strain on the cable because it's always bent one way or another.The PROS. keyboard cover is a godsend. Because of the 16:9 aspect ratio, the keyboard is wide and easy to get used to...and you really have to get used to that touch cover. It took me some practice and it's getting better. I prefer the TouchCover over the TypeCover for three reasons. I want the device to stay thin. I didn't want anything hard touching the screen. And I wanted the keys to be easily cleanable. The TouchCover can be wiped with a wet towel, I just wished the black one didn't have that cloth backing. The kickstand works perfectly when it's in the keyboard mode and I find myself using this tablet more like a laptop (on the desk) more than anything (thus, not a good table). The MicroSD card slot is a wonderful feature since you can never run out of room. Without it, I would've never bought this (I also would've never bought this at $499). Keep in mind that the 15GB left on your device is ALL THAT YOU HAVE in terms of app installation and system files. They cannot be saved onto the removable medias. The USB port has made moving files in and and out SOOOO much better than the iPad ever could have, and if you ever need to recharge your phone...you can plug it in this tablet. I don't have to worry about using iTunes and iPhoto and iWhatever! I'm an Excel power user and have found that having full Excel in this portable device extremely helpful.Last note. Unlike the iPad, you cannot just flip the cover OPEN and use the tablet because unless the cover is taken OFF or flipped ALL THE WAY around. The Surface knows a keyboard is attached so the on screen keyboard will not pop up until that hinge is flip past 180. It may seem like a small issue. But it get REALLY annoying after a while when you have to take that extra effort just to type in your lock code to check one thing.In closing. I think the RT is a perfect tablet-ish device for professionals and probably college students because it is a tablet for both creation AND consumption. The iPad is geared more for consumption. The only thing I wish the RT has is more apps. Having to go to the full websites and logging in via a browser makes this NOT a good tablet experience. If you have $350 (+$80-$120 for the cover, which I purchased on eBay) to spare and don't want an iPad mini ($329). The RT is a useful device for those who are not looking to play a bunch of games...16:9 is so much better than having black bars on your vidoes! Give and take I guess. iPad and RT both have some good features (sorry Android, never had experience with you) that can be very useful depending on where are you are.One LAST rant: the TouchCover retails for $119 and the TypeCover retails for JUST $129. That $10 difference gets you all those mechanical parts?!?!?!? I read that the cost of production on the TouchCover is extremely cheap/affordable and that they make a huge profit. They really should have had the TouchCover at $50 or so. I personally think what they charge for it is a slap in the face and plays a role in why the Surface sales suffered...especially since their ads/commercials/demos rely heavily on the convenience of a keyboard cover.", "Title": "Great DEVICE. Okay tablet", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "C. MILLER", "ReviewID": "R3PE3WZI6YY47F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, let me start by saying no written review can replace seeing and interacting with a product yourself, or better yet buying and trying this product out over a couple weeks.  Buying and trying is significant particularly with this device as you will want to see/try the apps available for what you want.  This device, while not perfect, is a solid option for many to consider, but in my opinion it all comes down to your needs.Second, I went into my tablet search without any biases towards one ecosystem or another.  In my opinion, they all have strengths and weaknesses.  I use both windows pc's and my trusty macbook pro, been an android phone user since the original droid, and own an ipad 2 which still sees use by my son daily.  I was replacing an aging kindle because I wanted something that could do more than just be a reader.  I knew I would probably not love reading on any tablet as well as I do an e-ink display, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make.  My primary uses were to read, consume content like hbo, hulu+, etc, surf the internet, and check emails.  I tried many devices and bought 3 and put them through their paces...the kindle fire hd 8.9, the galaxy note 10.1, and this device with the touch keyboard.  It was a very tough decision for me between this and the note, but I ended up keeping the note.  I won't bother going any further into the why x but not y debate.  I don't get paid to review tablets so justifying buying more than 3 tablets at once to my wife was not going to happen...after playing with them at the store and reading other folks' reviews, these were the three I wanted to put my money down on to test further.<<<Review>>>Hardware: this is a solid, solid device...compared to the other two I bought, this is the one that would win the \"most likely to survive a week with my 6 year old\" award.  Build was so good, I probably would not put it in a case just to save adding any further weight.  It feels industrial and high quality like my macbook and ipad.  That said I felt like it was heavier than I wanted and I don't actually prefer metal backs on handheld devices.  With the surface, I found it much more comfortable to turn the touchpad around so the felt side was on the back when holding it like a tablet.  That is just a preference thing and may/may not matter to you.  The integrated stand was really excellent with a caveat.  For sitting at a table, it is perfect...very sturdy feeling.  However, not optimal for uneven surfaces (like my belly).  This is where a decent case might give you more flexibility, but in putting this thing in a case, you make the integrated stand unusable (not to mention even heavier).  Also love the option to expand the memory.  Compared to the other two devices I would rank it Surface > Kindle Fire HD > Note.UI: I am a huge fan of the new Windows 8 UI.  It feels very clean.  I really liked the live tiles for things like pictures where I could link to my flikr stream.  Some live tiles I did not care for as much like the social ones, but those are easily turned off.  In terms of usability, I am an IT person and a long time user of Windows.  I did go through some growing pains learning the gestures and where things like options were stashed, but after a day or so, I felt very comfortable maneuvering around.  Definitely recommend folks taking the time to look at a few tutorials rather than struggle/doing things inefficiently.  Compared to the other two devices I would rank it Surface > Note > Kindle Fire HD.  However, for ui, personal preference is a large factor here.  I would just say this is one area where spending a week with the device makes a huge difference.  If you put a little effort into learning the gestures or shortcuts, I think you will like it.Screen: Screen is decent...people make too much of the lack of high resolution.  There are a few areas where it makes a noticeable difference (reading books unfortunately was one of those), but I would not select/avoid this tablet for this reason alone unless all you do is read books.  Cannot argue though that the Kindle Fire HD > Surface/Note particularly when rendering text, even with the clear type font.Camera: not much I can add here as this is one feature I never use, front or back, but I have never seen any review complement the surface on its camera.General performance: Pretty decent.  There can be a significant load time on some apps, but typically, once it loads, things are nice and smooth.  Browsing the internet was also very smooth (this was my favorite tablet for browsing). The few hiccups I had were probably due to the app and not a slight on the OS or hardware.  Note/Surface > Kindle Fire HD.Apps: First the good: getting office is a huge boon...if you plan to do work on this thing, do yourself a favor and consider this option.  Really, really liked several of the built in apps like the news and email apps.  IE is an excellent browser, and I prefer it even to dolphin on the android tablet.  Now the often lamented bad news, but with my personal take...the overall offering of apps is still very weak.  Comparing the total number in one vs. another is absurd.  So is quoting the number added per day.  These numbers always inflated by including thousands of useless or similar apps.  How many fart soundboards does one person need (zero)?  Here is my take on this.  A tablet is not an investment.  I am not speculating on a brighter future.  I don't care how many it has compared to how many the ipad had in its infancy.  I have certain applications that I consider must haves (like audible).  Other apps it has like the kindle app are terrible in their current form.  I expect they will be fixed to the level of being competitive.  The question is when.  I have been burned badly in the past buying devices with the expectation that they would get timely updates (Samsung Fascinate, I am looking at you!).  Also, the microsoft versions of apps were often more expensive.  It was not a huge difference, but those can really add up on the little throw away games my son loves and then gets bored with.  In the end, this ended up being the deal breaker for me.  There were just a few critical (to me) apps I could not find suitable replacements for, and there were no eta's for viable options.Other miscellaneous stuff: I actually loved the touch keyboard.  If I could find one that worked as well, was as light as this one, and worked with my note, I would buy one today.  YMMV, but after about 10 minutes, I felt very comfortable using it.  The combination of it + surface/surface pro would make for a really light/capable alternative to an ultraportable for folks on the road.  I also think people should not underestimate the frequency of updates...they seemed to come fast and furious while I owned it, and this could be an area where they really win over android users who tire of long inexplicable waits for updates.  Six months from now, this tablet could be a real winner and I may regret my decision to opt for the note.In short, it really comes down to your needs.  I would not hesitate to recommend it under certain circumstances, and look forward to seeing how these windows 8 devices evolve in the next year or so.", "Title": "Solid to good option depending on your needs", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Dana Durand", "ReviewID": "RTJ5ROXUFEZ41", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I rarely use my laptop anymore.

I'm very gentile with all my tech and so abuse is not an issue.  They worked great, but now there seems to be some quality issues.  About six months in on mine, it started having a phantom touch issue with the edges of the screen.  A quick screen off/on would fix it for minutes to hours, but the problem progressed until it was almost unusable.  So I took it back to the MS store and they exchanged for a new one under warranty.  Unfortunately, that one had an inop SD card slot. Now the battery wont charge and so it only works while connected to the charger.  Then the keys on my Typecover started falling off.  It's rarely used and usually just kept in a sleeve.  Then my wife's 64gb volume control button began sticking and broke to the point that the constant input prevents me from doing a soft reset after a hung update.  This is all in the last three months.  It's like a self-destruct signal was sent.These issues are really suprising to me, based on how solid and precise they feel/operate.  They basically replaced our laptops for the year-ish they were working.  I'm now sold on the tablet format and Win8.  I was even considering getting a 2gen Pro but now I'm too concerned with MS hardware quality to purchase any more of their products.

What made me decide to buy a Surface is Apple's nonsensical intransigence on the matter of a USB port on the iPad.  All of the dubious machinations Apple suggests for working around this serious limitation will not work (at least not gracefully) in many cases. Clients with secure Wi-Fi and no cell connectivity for instance (circumstances I encounter frequently in my business). For a supposedly post-PC device the iPad has, frustratingly, been nothing more than an expensive way to groom my e-mail and watch downloaded videos. Despite the numerous complaints about the iPad's lack of USB connectivity, Apple has vainly decided that beauty trumps utility.Enter Surface - a great screen, competitive storage capacity, impressive battery life, and - WOW - a USB and a micro-SD card interface and a HD video port built in.  Also comes with very useful e-mail client, and MS - Office aps (which we use a lot despite being an Apple shop)as nature of our work requires exchanging files with clients. Build quality is top notch - able to withstand the rigors of business travel. Yet it looks elegant and feels substantial.  If you are an iPad user I think you'll take to the tile and charm interface of Windows 8 right away. I understand how different a touch interface is for point and clickers but Win 8 really gives you both if/when you need. I find I can use my Surface in touch mode when I'm 'playing' and keyboard - mouse mode when I'm working - and this is exactly the right human interface proposition for me.Shortcomings: the less expensive of the two available keyboards takes some getting used to. I use an Amazon Basics mini Bluetooth keyboard often, and the USB port lets me connect an Amazon Basics mouse for serious editing - much faster than trying to finger your way around a cut and paste operation in a spreadsheet. Windows 8 RT is a runtime version designed for ARM processors and is rock stable but requires aps compiled for ARM. Don't expect to be able to install existing WIN programs on the RT version  of this tablet (though an Intel based Surface is rumored to be coming early 2013) but will undoubtedly have shorter battery life than the ARM processor. MS should incentivize developers - the lack of major airline aps and dedicated interface to other content providers needs to be overcome (but Apple didn't get its quarter million aps in 3 months either). Just don't forget us, Microsoft! Particularly we need security software (being a MS product) other than Windows Defender (Norton, Kaspersky, etc.). Lastly for a 'con'- Windows 8 looks like it's still based on NT/XP which means the occasionally frustrating trip through nested property sheets and having to put up with cryptic and uninformative error messages and warnings. Some of the most used system interfaces have more user-friendly access and most folks will probably never have to get deeper into the file structure so this is more of a nit than anything.Conclusion: Surface is a very solid, serious, stable and well built product with all the capabilities a business traveler would need. Yes, one can entertain oneself with books (there's a Kindle app) music and movies when able BUT one can also get real work done efficiently - meaning the display is good enough to use for long hours, and the battery will last through a two-leg flight and still have enough  juice to get you through an afternoon meeting. It's beautifully made - no shame in pulling this tablet out anywhere. It's usable right out of the box (comes with mail, Word, XL, PPT and a PDF reader, a music app and a photo app, IE,  and (did I mention?)a USB port!

When the app store fills out, I believe the device will match the IPad, while offering some distinct advantages.How does it do as a laptop?  Surprisingly well.  Having Office (update this as soon as you get it!) and the best remote desktop software on a tablet helps, a lot.The only hard limitation is that it doesn't run x86 apps (like the Pro version), but that's turned out to be far less of a limitation than I expected.  In my case, it's easier to remote into my workstation to use the tools of my trade (as a software developer).  Remote desktop on the Surface is infinitely better than any solution I've seen on the IPad.  The one piece of software I use that I don't have access to is Visio.Good- It's a beautiful piece of hardware.  IPad quality.- Beautiful screen.- The kickstand.  Simple and effective.  It works on a desktop, on a belly or lap.- A slick dynamic user interface.  The tiles are jarring at first, but they'll quickly make the rows of small icons you see on all the other tablets look dated.  I love it, and I love the potential.- The UI design.  Flicking the left thumb to switch apps and docking apps to the side (simple multitasking) are two great features.  The UI/Control is just highly polished and clearly well thought out.(rule #1:  \"SLIDE FROM THE SIDE\"...left for apps; right for system; top/bottom for the current app/view).- I love the 'picture password' feature, where you can swipe a picture (you choose), in a pattern (you pick) to login.- Every thing runs fast.

By itself, it was only about 350 bucks. I did, however, purchase the keyboard which is another 120 dollars.Now, let's talk about this tablet/computer. This device is running an ARM processor similar to the Nexus ARMv7 processor. If you don't know what that means, ARM is a mobile version of a processor. Which many normal functions that computers have don't work on here.For one, since it is a mobile processor, it won't run any sort of windows applications, like .exe and so on. So, if you're getting this for your gamer kid who uses Steam to buy games or plays Minecraft, find a different computer. He will be very disappointed with this one.This also means if you are not a fan of Internet Explorer, (like me,) you can't have Google Chrome or Firefox. Those applications are supported by actual computers, not tablets.If you still aren't understanding the difference between this tablet and a regular computer, think of it this way: If you have an iPad or an Android Tablet, you already know you can't run regular computer applications like Microsoft Word and so on. The only thing you can download from are appstores with Applications that have to be approved by Apple or Google Play. This tablet is the same: The only actual applications that you can run on this computer are the ones on the Windows 8 Store, which doesn't have a big or fun collection unless you want to spend some serious money.Now, let's talk about speed of the computer. Personally, I would compare this to the Asus Nexus 7 running Jellybean 4.1, or maybe the iPad 3rd Generation when it was running iOS 5.x. (Keep in mind we are now up to an iPad 4 running iOS 6.1.3 with iOS 7 soon to come out.)One more thing. This computer DOES SAVE MONEY, especially if you are a student, teacher, or parent of a student. Being that this is considered a mobile device, you cannot run regular computer applications (Such as Microsoft Word.) So Microsoft went ahead and threw in Microsoft Office, Powerpoint, Word, and Excel for free with no subscriptions. That potentially saves you $100-$300.Pros:-Sleek and fast computer.-Feels comfortable in your hands.-Doubles as a tablet and a computer.-Microsoft Office comes for free.-Only tablet on the market right now with a USB drive.Cons:-The charger is funky and doesn't like to sit properly.-ARM processor, not all Windows features.-not a Laptop, needs to sit on a flat surface to stand up properly.", "Title": "A nice tablet.

Here are the parts of both I love and the parts that are a bit less than perfect. Since my smart phone has become such a staple in my life and fills most of my needs for such a device, I really couldn't justify a tablet for its own sake, but had come to value the touch screen and wanted to check out Windows 8 so the Surface seemed a possible compromise that might work for me.  Since I needed the Surface to function as a laptop with real word processing, the keyboard was a primary concern.  I type a lot and fast so it had to be responsive. Typing on the screen is not an option for volume work, so I needed an attached keyboard.  I knew the touch keyboard wasn't going to work for me so I bought the `type' keyboard which has a more standard feel. It's not like typing on a regular keyboard because it is a bit smaller, but not much and it works well for me. I can type as fast as I do on a standard keyboard. The touchpad works well, but I've never been very good with those so I use a tiny mouse most of the time which plugs into the Surface's USB port.Even with the keyboard and mouse, I still use the touch screen really a lot, and love it.  Windows 8 RT operates enough like any smartphone or tablet that some parts are easy to pick up.  It's also enough like Windows 7 as far as Word is concerned, opening files, etc., to be familiar there, but overall, there is still plenty to learn.  In the course of one day, I figured most everything out as there are pretty obvious clues and one app I downloaded called Windows 8 Cheat Keys showed more options to get things done. There is both a standard desktop screen and an apps tiled home screen.  It will take me a while to get comfortable enough that things become automatic, though.  The basics are easy enough, but some functions are hidden and a swipe is needed to display them, or a hot key.  This unit combines both tablet capabilities and Windows capabilities so is more complex than either separately--it just does a whole lot more.The Surface comes with a preview version of Office 2013 that you can supposedly download free when it becomes officially available. It includes Word, Excel, OneNote and Powerpoint. I've only used Word so far and the only thing that is a bit of a struggle is that the ribbon and commands are so small, but of course, this in only a 10.6\" screen. I like to use Macros and couldn't find the command to create or run them, so at this point, I don't know if it's missing from this preview version or what. Otherwise Word runs like I'm accustomed to in Office 2010 and has allowed me all the other customization I'm used to. There appear to be advances, but at this point I'm just interested in getting my standard work done.Regarding Windows RT, the only thing I've not been able to do so far that I hoped to do is connect to my Windows 7 Homegroup. However, you can easily send files to the SkyDrive cloud, and after downloading that app onto my desktop computer, I can access the needed files that way.  Of course I could use a thumb drive, but SkyDrive is easier.I'm not a serious gamer and don't use the device for movies and the like, so can't speak to those functions. The apps I wanted were available in the Microsoft store--those mostly for productivity, reading my Kindle books, The Economist, to do lists and that sort of thing. Weather, time, email, calendar and a number of other apps are already on the device from the beginning. You have to set up a Microsoft account to access the store to download others and set up your email.I bought an SD card to increase storage space since the operating system and pre-loaded software and apps use up nearly half of the 32gb. Generally the size won't be a problem for me though because I'll mostly be saving text files, but I liked the idea of the extra space just in case I begin using the device for other purposes. Since I have tons of music, books and photos on my 32gb iPhone and still have plenty of space, I'm not too worried. It all depends on how you use such a device.I really needed the laptop capability in a very small package and I got it.  The Surface battery really pleases me. It charges fast and lasts a good 7 hours for me when I'm working on it a lot.  When it's sleeping, it lasts a lot longer.  I wish the cord were a bit longer, though, for when I want to use the device while it's charging and an outlet is not close by.  The cord is only about 5' long.  You can set the 'sleep' power settings like you do in Windows.  The unit comes with a pretty short dim/sleep time, which I set to be longer (once I found where to access that :).  It's fine for my phone to dim after a minute, but not my laptop.The Surface hooked up easily and automatically to my MiFi wireless internet device (all I had to do was enter the device password).  I can also use other WiFi networks where available.All in all I'm very happy with the Surface and would buy it again in a minute.  It meets my mini-laptop requirements and gives me the basic advantages of a tablet as well.Update 1/27/13: It hooked up to my Homegroup fine afterall.  Not sure why it didn't at first.  Won't print to my printers though (may be user error :) but I'm still using SkyDrive successfully to access files. Files don't upload to SkyDrive from SD card (drive D) though.  I saw on the internet how to rename that drive/card so it appears to be permanent and therefore useful for primary storage.  Haven't tried it yet though. The battery is astonishing.  With intermittent use in Word, looking at email, reading books, etc., and the device asleep when not in use, the battery lasts a couple of days at least.  I rarely power it off.Update 4/5/13: The Microsoft Office upgrade to the standard 2013 version downloaded itself in the background and is now available to me.  I didn't have to do anything.  The Surface downloads what updates it needs and installs them automatically just like a laptop.  It notifies you graciously if it needs to install something that requires a restart and gives you options on timing.  I've gotten so used to the touchpad, I no longer use the little mouse.  Some internet sites like AOL mail don't recognize the touch screen consistently (partly because the access point is so small I suspect) so I use the touchpad to check the boxes or whatever.  I'm so used to the functions in Windows 8 now, I don't give them a thought and really value how I can switch between activities so easily.

I really don't understand why. I was skeptical to buy it because of all the tech reviews. However I went with what a lot of customers said about the product and I took in account how I would be using my tablet.  So I bought it!  And I do not regret it at all.Price maybe a little high but very comparable to an Ipad.  But I love the build, the feel of the product, it's very fast, I like the 16:9 even if the resolution is a little lower, I can't really tell. I have no problems with portrait mode, even though it's clearly made for landscape. But it suits my needs. I write a little, take notes, having Office is great, with word and excel. Write papes and plan my budgets etc. I would love a photoshop and illustrator app though :) I am a very fast typer and unlike some other users I love the touch keyboard/cover. It does take some getting used to but it's awesome. I make a few mistakes from time to time but nothing major.  The apps so far completely work for me.. Okay there isn't a million but they will come along.  I'm not a huge game person, and I'm not into fart apps and what not. I do kind of wish that I had an Xbox instead of my PS3 because the integration with the Surface and Xbox is way cool.. But I do love my PS3.  Really this is a great product and I would recommended it to everyone. No GPS or no 4G? Who cares, use your phone for GPS and a Hot Spot. And don't fall into the whole it can't run legacy apps (one other reason why I bought the rt), but neither can the ipad.  There is always going to be ups and downs with any product that you buy.I'm not bashing apple or any androids either because I love my IMAC that I use at work for graphic design. It's great and I prefer it over my PC at home.  And I'm not bashing Ipads because they are a great product, and there is no doubt it about it. I'd take one any day.

The Surface is really in a class of its own. It's like a netbook in tablet form factor.

The touch or type cover is what really completes the experience and is an absolute must. I would not dare write a lengthy review on my Xoom or our iPad, but I'm writing this review with my Surface. On that note, the touch cover takes a few days of usage to get used to, but it works very well and I have no regrets getting a touch cover over the type cover. Your mileage may vary.When using it as a tablet, input can be configured to a regular keyboard, thumb keyboard, or writing recognition. I had to buy a thumb keyboard for my Xoom so the free thumb keyboard is a nice touch.My only nitpicks with the Surface so far are:- 32GB really means 17GB of free space, but it really isn't an issue with MicroSD expansion;- the power and volume buttons are too easily depressed;- the magnetic power connector can be designed better to make connecting it easier;- it has Flash, but not the latest and greatest so not all Flash videos will run;Microsoft has hit one out of the ballpark with the Surface.", "Title": "In a class of its own", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "RJ8YKU8AAK6XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best product I've bought all year!

My other HP laptop has grown old, slow, and extremely glitchy, but I chose to buy the Surface over a new laptop and to wait two years, then upgrade my major hardware.Now, as for reviewing it, let me start at the beginning of my journey with the tablet.Day 1, unboxing. I tried it out. Was pretty cool, slow. Oh so slow. And I hate the music app with a passion. Also the camera isn't comparable to that of the iPad.Day 7. The gestures are growing more intuitive(you've gotta understand the word 'intuitive' really shouldn't sell a product. I, usually accustomed to Apple gestures, had no idea what to do the first couple days. Now I get it), and the apps are growing slightly better. Just downloaded a huge update that speeds up the processing. I've come to realize that the hardware isn't slowing the product down, it's the software.Day 14. I seem to have found a soft spot in my heart for this device. I use the camera to Skype, even though it's just OK, it does it's job. I love Microsoft office and OneNote, and use them all the time. In addition, I spent money on a game application to test it's ability to run graphics (Hydro Thunder Hurricane) and it runs fairly smooth. Also discovered the gesture unlock. This is good fun. I actually lock my screen just to have the opportunity to look cool and unlock it.Day 21. Preaching how lovely my tablet is. One thing: the software is still lagging. I decided to travel down to my local Microsoft store and voice my concerns. I've concluded that the boys down at HQ don't seem to understand that they better improve their software soon. Also I have become a part time sales associate for Microsoft, although I don't get paid... Every time I flip open the Surface and swipe open the lock screen I get questions about how I like the surface. Seriously Microsoft should pay me.Day 30. Microsoft needs to update their software. My hope toward the future is growing dim. The success of this tablet doesn't lie in better hardware, but better software. Improve speeds, less integration of Xbox into all it's media centers. FIX THE MUSIC APP FROM BEING STUPID. Also, fix the music app. Seriously. Fix it now. Right now. If you are a Microsoft employee and you are reading this, kick yourself in the shin for not forcing someone in the company to fix the app. Or kill yourself. It's that bad.Holistic Review: The Microsoft Surface comes out as a tablet of compromises. What it lacks in bling (retina display, lovely cameras) and also hadleability (I just made up that word. It means that people complain they don't like how they can't REALLY use portrait mode like an iPad, and that the onscreen keyboard is not fully reachable while holding the tablet with both hands like a steering wheel), it makes up for in practicality, and possibility. It has the hardware to succeed as a tablet. Also the keyboard and kickstand make this essentially a very skinny laptop, which I love. I take it everywhere and can just plop it down and work on whatever needs to be done, be it an Excel spreadsheet or some research online. In terms of possibilities, once again, my mainstay is hope that Microsoft improves their software on the Surface. In my humble opinion, it definitely beats the iPad. I can type at normal speed with the keyboard I have (not the skinny touch but still a very slim keypad) and it allows for a much higher level of productivity.Verdict: Buy this tablet. You won't regret it. It's a lovely piece of hardware and a great compromise to achieve the most reasonable tablet for 90% of all your needs.", "Title": "Microsoft Surface after 1 Month", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "JayInAtlanta", "ReviewID": "R3L7X57ZAMXBD2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do have the exact device I am reviewing. Can't stand it when people leave reviews about things they don't own.Microsoft hit at least a triple with this device, which shows off the strengths of the company and its newest version of Windows.The negative is that Windows RT finally cuts the cord with Microsoft's admirable philosophy of backwards-compatibility with software and hardware from 20+ years ago. RT is a simple version of the OS which offers an \"app\" based environment, cloud services and cloud storage, but won't run the same programs you already have on most Windows devices. If this bothers you, then buy an Asus VivoBook now (best of both worlds) or wait for more Windows 8 \"Pro\" tablets to hit the market, including Microsoft's own Surface Pro.Other than that negative, I can find very little to critique about the Surface. It has plenty of memory onboard for my uses. It has SkyDrive cloud storage and SD card expandability, and I understand it can even be upgraded to a 64 GB version with extra memory purchase if desired. The tablet is a bit heavy, especially in portrait mode, but quite honestly the weight of my iPad 2 bothers me also after a while. As a film guy, I love the 16:9 aspect ratio in landscape mode. It makes the layout of other devices that I own look pathetic.I find most of the apps user-friendly and much more fun to use than the average app on my iPad. The user interface is smooth, functional, and beautiful, and I love the live tiles that make it so easy to pick up the device and get quick info.A very highly recommended device.

My wife was getting tired of them using her laptop to do their homework and also tired of them clicking on URL links from the web that download junk onto her laptop and therefore messing her laptop up all the time.When we found this tablet, it seems to be perfect for what we needed.  When it comes to doing homework, this tablet beats iPad hands down - my wife has one but the kids can't use iPad for homework as it does not have the MS Office products like Words and Power Point (yes I know it is MS fault for not having a version of Office for iOS).  Surface comes with Office 2013 preview and the kids and use this to actually do their homework assignments.  For $499 from Microsoft store with Office 2013 installed, you really can't beat this price (we paid $599 to get the touch keyboard cover also).A lot of people complain about Windows RT not able to run older software but it is actually a selling point for us.  No more junk that get installed on this tablet and we can control what get downloaded/purchased from the Windows store.The ability to create multiple logins/users for my kids is helpful and when you set them up, you can specify that they are children and you can get reports email to you as far as how much them they spent on the device and how much time they browse the internet, etc.  These accounts I created for them limits their ability to do certain things on the tablet - such as create new users.I would not repeat what so many others have already said about the device but I just have to add that my children love this tablet and they have no problems picking up the new gestures and slight learning curve associated with using the Windows 8 environment.On the down side, the magnetic power cord is annoying but that is about the only thing I do not like about the design.  I am in the market for a new printer and found that Windows RT does not \"fully\" support some of the features that are normally fully supported by regular Windows 8.  For example, they have \"limited\" compatibility for the Epson All-in-One Printer I am thinking about buying - the printing part is supported but the faxing and scanning part may be somewhat limited from the tablet.  This is a minor point for us as we still have desktop and laptops that will fully utility the printer.We are very happy with the purchase.", "Title": "Nice tablet to do homework", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Michael Moss \"Michael\"", "ReviewID": "R3CAPGCA6H97E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know this is long but if you are a professional/business user you may want to skim through it.I've had an iPad since the very first generation came out and while it's a remarkable device, it seems like a toy in comparison to the Microsoft Surface.  I use the Surface for work and I don't care how many apps the Apple App Store has ... They don't have real Microsoft Office ... I live and breathe Office at work, so this was the major deciding factor for giving the Surface a try.My needs:* A companion to my work laptop that I can take with me to meetings to take notes (Evernote), respond to exchange email, and occasionally look things up online.* A tablet I can easily take home at night or to conferences/meetings outside of work to remain productive without lugging my work laptop, charger, etc with me.* Occasionally used for media consumption (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, and built in Videos application) - especially at conferences or sometimes at night in bed.* Web browsing to fill in any free time - have to keep up on the news!The Office applications are uncompromised and meet all of my needs - I can review and edit complex documents with track-changes and comments, I can reformat Excel spreadsheets and add complex formulas and I can quickly flip through PowerPoint presentations on my way to meetings or even connect to a projector to give the presentation myself.  I wouldn't think twice about creating a new document from scratch on my Surface - something I would never, never say about the iPad.  I use Outlook extensively on my desktop - the built in Mail and Calendar applications are richly featured and useful, and they will be releasing full Outlook RT in just a few months.The Surface has many other work-friendly features that continue to amaze me - I can scan and print documents on our network printers, I can VPN to the work servers and even map my network drives, I can log into my work computer (via RDP or via third-party applications like Splashtop) to email myself something I accidently left saved on my desktop, and it will connect to my office WiFi which uses archaic `wireless a' standards and complicated authentication.I chose the Surface based on battery life - I need something that will last all day and I can easily get a full day of work done with battery to spare.  I also chose it based on the size (it's as slim as the newest iPads), weight and the looks (I don't want to get pegged as a tech geek at work and it looks enough like apple/android tablets that it doesn't turn too many heads - a good thing).I originally got the type keyboard and exchanged it for a touch keyboard - the opposite of what most people do.  The type keyboard is brilliant and I could type perfectly, but it makes noise when you type (like all \"real\" keyboards).  I returned it and got the touch keyboard because it's completely 100% silent when you type so I can take notes and respond to emails at meetings without disturbing anyone else.  I do realize I don't type as well on it but it's an easy trade off to stay productive without clickty-clacking away on a keyboard.  It's a brilliant innovation in my opinion.  Also has a trackpad!!I have the Surface on my desk and use it like a second monitor when I'm not in meetings.  I usually leave my email up so I can see things as they come in, but also pull up calendar or other items when I need to look back-and-forth between two programs.  It has REAL internet explorer - no other tablet can compete on this.  It just works beautifully on the REAL web - I've come to hate mobile websites...It uses real Windows so it's familiar and easy to use.  It's amazingly fast and fluid - since you have Microsoft hardware and software, everything has been finely tuned to work together and it flies.  The hardware is really impressive - it's very polished, well thought out, professional looking and feeling and attractive.I originally thought I would need full Windows (X86 or X64) and so I had an Ativ 500t Smart PC.  With the keyboard dock and larger screen, it looks like a cheap plastic netbook.  The bottom line is that I couldn't take it to meetings without people asking me about it and I didn't want to deal with it or garner that type of attention.  The surface looks slick and polished and does not grab attention (but look good if someone cares to gander at it).So I wanted to change out the Ativ for something more professional.  I really looked at how it would be used (instead of how it could be used) and I realized that Office, email and Evernote would meet 99.9% of my work needs - so I decided to try Microsoft RT.  I've yet to run into a work scenario where I needed to pull up a proprietary application.I think the Surface got a bad wrap early on but as a business user I now totally `get it'.

The lack of apps is not in their control, but I think there will eventually be enough apps for most people.  Not likely to approach the apps for iPad or Google anytime soon, but fine for the target audience of this device.However, MS is guilty of not explaining what the Surface is (and is not) and has done a horrible job of explaining Windows 8.  The Surface is an attempt to bridge the gap between media consumption devices like the iPad and PCs.  The Surface offers the portability and convenience of a tablet and basic productivity functions.  MS packaged Word, Excel and Power Point with this device which is all most people need for a secondary device.  If you want/need more, get a full blown PC with an Intel chip for much more money.  Yes, there are a few PCs that can be had for the price of the Surface, but they do not offer the portability of the Surface.To make their first mistake even worse, MS does not include any instructions on using Windows 8, which is a new OS for most of us.  The OS is really neat, but it is NOT intuitive.  At first it is off putting until you get the hang of it.  MS should offer more help.  The Holiday Store where I bought my device gave me a 4 or 5 hundred page manual for free.  That was nice, but I should not have to go through a manual just to get the hang of the device and the manual appears to have been rushed out.

I was wrong....I bought this for my wife who is a nursing student. Her university requires her to take tests, view online content, instructional videos ect through their websites. Most universities have these types of online interfaces. Unfortunately her Microsoft Surface cannot load the content and it is incompatible.

Silverlight is a plug in that developers use so that their videos work in Internet explorer.I am not an Apple person at all but at least their interface allows you to use all websites. I am very disappointed in this simple neglect that Microsoft chose to allow happen. Windows 8 supports Silverlight but RT doesn't int heir own tablet????

Caveat: Do I think W8 is great on a non-touch device? Nope. It stinks. IMHO.W8 on a touch device though? I freaking love it. This is not the Pro, but the RT. That said, you can't install your own software on this one (that's what I've read so far). I have never needed to though as the RT comes with MS Office pre-installed. This is a savings over the Pro, FYI. The Pro doesn't come with MS Office installed. Also, this has a slower processor than the Pro, but it shuts down and boots fast (if you do like me and map the power to the power button, instead of hibernate, that is). I showed a work mate how fast it boots yesterday (he asked because his wife's thinking of getting the Pro) and he was thoroughly impressed as well.Yes, the app store for W8 blows. Blows like the great Northern wind, but it is getting better.As with any new OS, there is a learning curve, but if you go into this with an open mind, you'll have no problems adjusting. Those that fight new, will fight this and give up. Don't do that though, this is a great machine and i take it everywhere with me. Fits in my backpack and is very lightweight.I didn't go with the touch keyboard. To me, that thing is a fail. I like the clicky-clack of the type keyboard much better. The keyboards do snap right onto the Surface (magnetic), but the power cord is a bit weak in the connecting, which is one of the negatives for me. The other being the lack of USB ports (there's one).", "Title": "Love It", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "KAS \"KAS\"", "ReviewID": "R2F799GQQPD94S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I have an iPad, and loved it.  Then, I made the decision to buy a Surface because it has Office preinstall.  I was expecting a good tablet, but I was not expecting such a high quality product from Microsoft, really...I was not...but I can honestly admit now that the iPad looks old (no Keyboard cover) and limited (no USB or HDMI out) when comparing it with Surface. Furthermore, I tried also (just for fun) a Samsung Galaxy (for 15 minutes), and the Galaxy looks like a toy when comparing it with both the iPad and Surface. My overall conclusion is: if the Surface had more apps (e.g.: Sonos, Pandora, CNN, a few more) I would definitely sale my iPad (when I can still get some serious $$ for it) and keep the Surface is my primary tablet and laptop.  Good job Microsoft,  I guess you should invest more on making your own hardware!", "Title": "Best Tablet Yet!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "John \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R3HJ6CKLIDE03R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an Android person for a years.  I have an android phone, a Kindle, and have owned Lenovo tablet (until it died just out of warranty) and a Samsung Galaxy 10.1.I purchased a 32g Surface about a month and a half  ago and have been extremely satisfied.  The unit itself is very well designed.  The integrated kickstand works very well.  Build quality is excellent.  Screen is sharp and touchscreen responsive. Wi-Fi  reception is the best I've seen in a portable device.  In terms of sheer design and functionality, the Surface seems to have leapfrogged the competition.  All of the other tablet/pad makers seem content with copying each other.  MS broke from the pack and seems to have started from a blank slate when designing this.I bought the Touch Cover, not the Type Cover.  I was not sure how well I would like a keyboard that did not have the tactile response of movable keys.  However, I am thoroughly satisfied with it.  It also functions very well as a cover, and the magnetic attachment is great.  Want to use the Surface like a traditional tablet?  Snap it off.  Want to use it more like a notebook? Click it on.  I will admit that if I ever intend to write a long document, I would probably opt for the Type Cover, but for email and short documents, the Touch Cover is fine.It may sound odd if you have not tried it, but there are many times when having a mouse, or a mouse pad, with a tablet is much better that touchscreen.  Touchscreen is great, but has its limitations.  Highlighting sections of text, selecting a small font clickable areas, drawing, some things are just easier to do with a mouse pointer.  MS deserves kudos for having the integrated mouse features.A full size USB port is very important that the Surface has one.  There are many instances when this comes in handy.  Most other tablets either do not have them, or require you to carry around a dedicated and typically overpriced adaptor.Expandable memory is a real plus. This should be a standard feature of all tablets, but it is not.  By adding an microSDXC card you can add an additional 64GB of memory for less than $50 (current prices).As with all things, I do have some complaints.  I think the lack of a GPS is a significant shortcoming.  The Wi-Fi based location service works to a certain extent, but does not position you as exactly as a GPS.  For the price of the surface, there should be a dedicated GPS. The cameras could be better as well.  They are fine for video chatting or a taking a casual photo, but that is about it. However, if you want to take a quality image, I have yet to see a phone or tablet that has a decent camera. They are getting better, but dedicated cameras continue to improve as well.  Even a moderately priced point-and-shoot camera will take much better images, and work much better in poor lightning, than even the best smartphones or tablets.  The native email app does not support POP, and instead uses IMAP.  I know POP is old technology, and IMAP has advantages over POP, but some ISPs do not support IMAP.  Luckily there is a workaround and I had my POP email address up and running in a few minutes.Windows RT and the Windows 8 interface is a great improvement over previous versions of windows or Apple interface.  It does take some time to get used to.  However, it seems more intuitive and functional.  I have used this daily for over a month and have not had any issues with RT such as freezing or erratic behavior. It seems much more stable than Android or Apple (based on the experience of Apple using friends).  So far RT seem rock solid.  This is the best tablet interface I have used. If you have an Xbox, this integrates nicely with Xbox music and video.  I have used both.  Xbox Smartglass also seem like it has great potential.  I have tried it briefly, but have yet to watch a SmartGlass integrated movie or TV show.  I'm looking forward to more movies and media supporting it.While MS claims RT has over 10 thousands apps, and an independent Windows RT app tracking site show they add about 500 apps a day,  let's face it, it is going to take time for RT to catch up with the several year head start Apple and Android have.  Many of my favorite Android apps are not available for RT.  Many popular Android and iOS apps are available, but many are missing. The lack of apps is the downside.  Given the newness of the Surface there are also very few accessories available.  As of this writing MS has no dedicated car charger or a docking station. Hopefully the number of accessories will grow.In summary I am very pleased with Surface and have no regrets in purchasing it.  I really think this is the \"next generation\" in tablets.  My android table is gathering dust and will probably be sold soon.  I just hope the Surface and Windows RT reach commercial success so more apps are written for it, and more accessories become available.  For that to happen people will have to willing to break out of the brand name \"I'm an Apple person,\" I'm an Android person\" mold.  That is asking a lot for some.

For me, it offers the best of both worlds. I can do work for class, school etc and then I can use the apps (which--although limited in offerings--are great and more than ample). The apps I have downloaded are all free and there are some really great apps! It also comes with great apps already on board!Well, after having it for two weeks I can say this is the best purchase I have ever made. I absolutely love it.

This surface tablet is really really fantastic.", "Title": "Best TABLET EVER!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Chowdder", "ReviewID": "R2VFEVXI309WC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this tablet for a good month and put it through the paces. I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed with what I have seen. I was deeply entrenched in the android tablets (had a TF700T) and was ready to get the nexus 10 until I gave the Surface a shot. I bought it when it was first made available back in November at the Microsoft popup store in Toronto. The store clerk told me that I had 2 weeks to try and if unsatisfied, then I can return the tablet without added charges. I gave it the full 2 weeks and by the end, I key the Surface and sold my TF700. What impressed me most about the tablet is the fact that it is the closest thing that I've came across with that I can use in place of my laptop. However, I want to remind everyone that if you want tons of apps, then the Surface is definitely not for you (at the moment).I first got this to be used as a study aid for school since lugging around all my textbooks are a pain. I like the benefit of multitasking two windows at the same time so I often used it to compile my notes as well as use it to review lecture materials, looking up wikipedia, or checking the reference textbooks on pdf or chm files. The fact that it came included with a full copy of MS Office was amazing. I used it on a daily basis and the new version has some familiarity and nice touches that make it a bit more touch-screen friendly. For instance, you can increase button sizes so they are easier to press with fingers. I find this is a great companion for students. I have to say that there really isn't any good substitute for Office apps on any other tablets (Yes I bought and tried a lot on my android tablet, and the experience was quite miserable).The inclusion of a full-size USB port on this tablet makes it really a workhorse tablet. I've tried so many different peripherals to enhance the tablet's potential. I've tried, at least 2 different mice, USB keyboard, copying files to my android phone, charging my Nexus 7, copying files from a USB card reader, and printing with a USB printer. In fact, you can connect a USB hub and run 4 USB devices in one go. Of course that will drain your battery, but the flexibility it offers is amazing. The other day, I was making presentation while sharing files amongst my peers who had only had their USB thumb drive to work with. Of course, you gotta see the potential in something like this; otherwise it's a wasted feature.Speaking of internet, one joy of using this tablet that is often omitted is that since it is running on a Windows 8 RT, you have the same basic access to the network homegroups as you do on regular full windows 8 OS. I can access pictures, videos, and all sorts of files I have on my other Windows PC within the wifi network. You can also print via wifi through a windows PC. This is great since I don't like uploading some of my more sensitive documents on the cloud, and physically syncing via USB drives is too cumbersome. These are great functionality.One thing that should be mentioned is that many complained that it lacks legacy app supports for old windows programs. I question whether that is particularly a bad thing. Running old apps means you run the risk for contaminating with virus, malware, and spywares. The old windows x86 problems remain relatively unaffected for Windows RT. This means no need to run background the usual suite of antivirus software, which improves battery life.As for battery life, my personal experience with the tablet, is that I am amazed by its great battery life. I generally get about 6-8 hours of constant heavy use out of the tablet. If I use it lightly, I can get through a couple of days without charging. In fact one time, I left my tablet in my gym locker for a full weekend and retrieved it on Monday. I was amazed that during the entire time, I only lost 15% battery when the tablet went on standby for 2 days.Of course, I can't say it's all praise and no flaw. Its flaws are also somewhat major. I'm not going to mention any of the software flaws, since I believe that is fixable with update. What can't be fixed are the hardware problems, namely the poor CPU included, and the weight. Tegra 3 was a poor choice because it is barely able to keep up with the multitude of tasks that I throw at it. It stutters if I open too many tabs on the browser, and it lags on some of the simple games offered in the Windows Store (i.e. Cut the Rope and Jet Pack Joyride.....it lags when you touch the screen). Also, the tablet is very heavy for a handheld device. It is very uncomfortable holding it for an extended period of time. Also finally, the touch cover is great, but I often miss hitting the space bar because the keyboard is so cramped vertically due to the inclusion of the trackpad. The rest are software issues, which although I had initially, most are being addressed with updates (I've received 2 major updates since buying it 1 month ago, pretty good support).In general, I don't think everyone should buy this tablet. It is for certain group of people who see the value in owning a device that is flexible, have sturdy hardware, and runs the latest Windows. If you don't care about Windows, Office, or you need to have apps, and then stick with an iPad or a Nexus tablet.

This was my first tablet and I wanted to have something to travel with when I didn't need/want to lug both a laptop and a e-reader. Unfortunately, the Surface did not fit my needs on a trip and after 6 days and a stop by the Microsoft retail store to clarify my usage of it (was it me or the tablet that was the problem), I returned it to Best Buy and got a full refund (no restocking fee, I was incredibly happy).As an ereader it worked fine with a downloaded Nook App, it is super lightweight and I carried it around all day in a handbag with no shoulder strain. As a web browser, most of the websites I was trying to use from the road were (according to the Microsoft store) not optimized for tablet use yet. It was frustrating as hell trying to access info on websites but when I touched the link nothing would happen. I was told that I would need a keyboard attachment and use the mouse feature to be able to click on the link. Well spending the $ and having to carry around a keyboard defeated my original intent. I also found the loading time on web pages annoying long - and this was on multiple wifi networks, my phone loaded faster than the Surface did. So I returned it the Surface.During my 6 days I did not once use the MS Office features, so I can't say how they worked.

I was told the Windows 8 on the RT version was more powerful, but at that price it's not worth it to me.

I didn't pay attention much on the app features when I looked for a tablet because my cellphone has all the apps installed and I don't use them that much.Now as I use Surface more, I tried to install very basic apps that I use on my cellphone, such as Facebook, Kakaotalk, New York Times... etc, and none of them work properly. You kidding, no Facebook app?? You can find Facebook app actually, but it frequently freezes and the photos don't fit in the screen. It is frustrating to use. In addition, after 2 weeks, it asked to pay to continue to use. I am not sure it is official Facebook app or some third party created. Many popular apps that can be easily found and installed on Android or Ipad tablets are missing and even if you could find them, there are a lot of bugs.

First that of an academic:  I needed a tool to carry my presentations and lectures to class for use on Smart boards and other projection devices that would give me good interactivity. The fact it is already loaded with the MS Office tools ensured it would work with my desktop.  I also go to meetings where I need to take light notes. I bought the type cover (not the touch cover).  The type cover might not be as hip as the brightly colored alternative, but for an old curmudgeon like me, the type cover feels like a real computer.  The fact it has a USB port (unlike others) was a key factor as the flash drive is very common as a way to bring information to class.  For all this it fits the bill perfectly. Additionally, it is small light enough to easily fit in my satchel without filling it up as does my laptop, or requiring me to carry two cases around campus. The long battery life means I can go all day without worrying about how to pug-in when I'm in old buildings with few plugs.HOWEVER;  the limited use of the flash player is a problem that greatly reduces the overall usefulness of the machine.  For instance, as of yesterday, I could not use Adobe Connect, a common tool for on-line classes with my Surface because it is not on Microsoft's \"good\" list. Surely Microsoft will fix this glaring problem soon.My other use is to show my photographic portfolio as a part time professional photographer. Again for this it is just perfect. Its size means it will even fit in my camera bag and I don't even need the battery charger.  With stunning graphics that make my photos look great, my clients love me, so I love the Surface.The build quality is top notch, I did not want a toy, this is not a toy. It can be confusing (for 50 year old me, but not for my 18 year old son).

I've owned the tablet for a week now. It is a very good product. I own a ASUS U36J Laptop, and ASUS EP-121 Tablet. I don't subtract for items I don't really care about, or don't need. I judge it on what I need it for, not what I don't need it for. I wanted this tablet for work not play. Long battery life, and MS Office/OneNote was most important to me. I don't need to run all my legacy software. I purchased from Staples, not Amazon.Star 1 - Build quality. The tablet feels very nice in the hands. Solid. The seams are tight around the frame and display. The back is a strong case. The kick plate is a great feature. It snaps into place, and is strong. Power/Vol. switches are good, and respond well. Weight of the tablet is not too heavy. There is no creaking or twisting of the frame. The battery life is outstanding. I will be able to fully test when I take it to work and use it all day with no charger. I noticed a speed difference between my i5 Tablet, and the RT, but that should be expected. Yes, it is not as fast, but I get far more battery life from the RT. Overall it is a well built tablet of very good quality. I give it a full star for build quality, functions, and features.Star 2 - Video/Audio. Although the display is not as high a resolution as the Surface Pro or an iPad, it is fine for viewing productivity apps like the ones I'll be using. It is very responsive to touch, in all aspects of a touch screen. Pinch to zoom and rotation act quickly. I haven't used the cameras so I really don't have an opinion on them. I find most cameras in these devices not very good. I am sure they function as expected, and ok for Skype and video chatting. No dead pixels in the display. The speakers are not good for music, but I didn't buy this for music or video chatting or photography.Star 3 - Ports/Connectors. The SD card slot is behind the kick stand, and is located in a good position. The unit comes with a USB 2.0 port which functions as expected. It's positioned high enough on the right side of the frame not to interfere with the power cable. It is oriented correctly so that the USB Symbol will face you when you insert the cable. Not too tight when inserting or removing the plug. The headphone jack located on the upper left, above the volume switch which makes sense. Headphones/Volume go together, and works good. It's pretty standard headphone jack. The biggest issue is the power connector. As noted else where, the connector is difficult to make the connection. Seems they could have made it deeper recess or designed it like the keyboard connector. It works better for me with the plug up side down, but the light points down then. I'm ok with it, but it is a problem. I deducted a half of star for it.Star 4 - Keyboard. I bought the touch keyboard for specific reasons versus the type. The whole design of the keyboard connector is great. It is crisp, and always snaps into position correctly. This is the opposite of the power connector. The touch keyboard is different to type on, and does require some relearning. It is not as fast as regular keyboard, but then again is not a regular keyboard, it is a touch keyboard. I also have a MS 6000 Bluetooth keyboard that I use at my home desk. I like the fact when you fold the keyboard back under the tablet it disables it, and uses the touch screen. The touch keyboard works great for what it is, a cover/keyboard that wont damage the screen. It is one of the strong points of the tablet for productive work. A full star.Star 5 - Software. First, Windows 8 is great for this format(tablet). I love the start screen. MS took a bold step, and I appreciate that. The Start button was getting stale and needed something new. And the Start screen works great for tablets. I have Win 8 on my laptop as well, and it works good. It takes a little bit to get use to it, and I like now. The tablet comes with trail version MS Office Word, Excel, Power Point, and OneNote installed. In addition, OneNote Metro is available for free from the store. So far I haven't not been able to find a program I want from the store. The selection is small, but growing. Some very nice apps though are available. There is a nice selection of apps installed on the tablet. There will constant improvement in this area, so I don't worry about it too much. Using MS account, the tablet and laptop sync items between each other. For example, if I change the desktop wallpaper on the laptop, it changes on the tablet. Other items sync as well, and I have to play with that more. The tablet has everything I need software wise, with OneNote being the most important to me. Full Star here.Overall, a very good tablet made for work. I deduct a half star for the power connector. One of the most important connectors in mobile devices, and it doesn't work as well as it could. They could have designed it better, and had to know it was that good. Everything else functions as expected. I haven't had any freezing or crashes. System has long battery life. I've used it all day, with no charging. In my humble opinion, buy the 32GB with a touch keyboard. Save yourself money, since you can expand storage with a SD Card, USB flash or a USB My Book drive. As always, take it for what it is worth.

When I first brought it, I was ecstatic. Then the dual OS drove me nuts for the first 8 hours. Within the next day I realized how much I love the dual OS ONCE you get use to it (Please learn all keyboard shortcuts). Then I realized the limits of taking notes on Capacitive stylus and was again, thinking about a return. I then figure how to optimize OneNote so that I can take good notes and sync them on cloud. I LOVE the device. Now, within this week, I have met sluggish and buggy performance after my 14 day return policy. I was starting to hate the device again. Just two days ago, I found out why: I had 3 desktop apps opened, 5 IE tabs opened, along with 5 Windows Store apps maxed open on the Surface. This not only caused SOOOO much lag, but bugs in each app. When I found out, I immediately learn the habit of swipe and close apps. The surface is Microsoft try-hard product. I love what they are doing, but they need to adopt some Apple's iPad strategy: 1) If you are going to allow multi-task for up to 5 apps WITH desktop, please have at least 4 GB ram 2) If not, 5 apps are overkilled. I really only use about 3 apps at once. They also need to implement a \"kill-all\" app feature when you swipe left and right to see all the apps. Now, after today's update, everything is fast, bugless, smooth... everything I have experienced plus more since the beginning!

I use it for the internet and Office apps pretty much. But I also can detach the keyboard and have a full use Tablet to hang out with on the couch. I think it is a knock out. I did not want the Surface Pro because the battery time is 50% less and I cannot stand carrying around cords and I do not need much more than Microsoft Office.

These aren't browser apps or third-party variants, but are real, actual Microsoft Office programs - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. While the choice to not include Outlook (indeed, Outlook has not yet been ported to Windows RT) is unfortunate, the built-in Mail app is more than adequate - be sure to update it from the Store once you get online. It supports Exchange ActiveSync (and Gmail, and Hotmail, Office 365, etc.) and does fine.Have I mentioned how awesome SkyDrive is? Got a presentation to give? No problem. Put it on your SkyDrive (or flash drive - yeah, this thing has a full USB port).

I use a SanDisk 64GB micro SD card in addition to the in-built 32GB storage. Works like a charm.3. It has a full size USB port. This is probably the best part as it makes transferring files super easy. This is where I prefer this over my Ipad mini.4. It has a kick stand. This comes in handy for easy viewing as it holds the tablet up without issues.5. It's got a solid build. It does not feel cheap.6. It's powerful! My ipad mini cannot play full hd videos that have been shot with my Canon 5d mark II camera, but this tablet handles it fine! This alone makes it stand out.7. You can connect an XBOX 360 wired controller to this tablet for gaming and it just works! No need to install any drivers or anything. It simply recognizes the remote.8. The best part is that you can play Super Nintendo games on this using the xbox remote. Simply download the SNES emulator app, and just do a google search on how to get the games. Also, some of the other games ( aside from the super nintendo) also work with the controller. This makes it a great portable gaming device....Now here are the things I disliked:1. The battery life is not great in standby mode. Unlike the Ipad mini which seems to last forever in standby mode, the windows surface RT will only last about a week in Standby mode. However, do note that in practical use, it lasts about 8 hours. This standy issue can easily be avoided by simply turning the tablet off when not using it instead of using the sleep function....2. It's a bit heavy. But then again it's packing decent power and a USB interface....3. Windows is terrible for apps!!!! The same apps available on the Ipad or Android devices seem to cost money on the Windows device. This is not fair or right. Furthermore, the apps are just lacking..... Every device seems to cater mainly to apple or android devices, and windows usually gets left in the dust....4. The sound quality of the built in speakers could be better....

I'm a college professor2. I regularly go from classroom to classroom, campus to campus3. I'm a long-time Microsoft Office user4. My primary need in a tablet is productivity and mobilityThat said, the RT surface is ideal. It's roughly the equivalent of having a fully functional computer that's as big as a small magazine. The only thing I've discovered yet that's a limitation is it can't run Java-based programs. Other than that, it's just a PC in tablet formThe PROS:- full MS Office suite, fully functional- THE FREAKIN USB - I can add anything, anything to the computer directly (although you can do a lot with Cloud based stuff like Dropbox and Google Drive, so the external flash drive is almost a moot point, but still handy). The USB also allows me to plug in a clicker for presentations- The Battery - seems fine to me. I can give three lectures in row, with Power Points, videos, and Prezis and never have to plug it in. Granted, it's pretty spent after that, but all in all, it's great. The reason I bring it up is just because it's not usual for me to be in a classroom with no convenient plug near the podium I'm lecturing from.- The VGA out - works perfectly everywhere I've gone. As soon as I plug it in - POP - the tablet extends the screen to the projector by default. This also allows me to split screen when using Power Point, thus allowing me to see the next slide in advance, as well as any notes I may have written for myself.- the shape - I find the overtly rectangular shape rather comfortable, as reading and annotating PDFs feels more natural when you turn it on its side and hold it in one hand, like a book.- the snap on keyboard - simple, perfectly functional, and the magnetic \"click\" just feels cool. I'm using the most basic keyboard it has. It's not the best keyboard in the world as far as action and feel, but I only use it every now and then. I wouldn't necessary right a paper with the keyboard, just small notes and such. Were I to write something large, I would just plug in a proper keyboard- Overall power and performance - at one of the campuses I go to, I had to bring in my own desktop for my office. Circumstances changed, and I needed to bring the desktop home. So, I started using just my Surface instead, using an extra monitor and keyboard. There's zero difference between using my Surface and mid-grade desktop tower (except the occasional software issues, the only one I've discovered so far is the Java thing I mentioned above).The CONS -The Power Supply - the power supply magnetically snaps in place like the keyboard, but its a bit of a pain in the ass. You can't just slap it on like you can with the keyboard. Minor thing, but annoying nonethelessThe Apps - the app store is a ghost town, mostly just games and social media right now. Not much in the way of productivity, but you can work around things if you're creative. For example, I found \"FILE BRICK\" which allows you to use all your Cloud based drives in one place (Dropbox, Google drive, etc), and that's handy. There's also not much for PDF annotation, but I did find \"DRAWBOARD\" which does an impressive job (but it's like $8. Worth it, but still, not as handy as all the things you'd find on an iPad for free)The Interface - I actually like Windows 8, and the interface makes much more sense on a tablet than on a stand alone computer. However, little things, like being able to lock the screen so it doesn't shift from side to side when you turn it can be more of a hassle than what seems is necessary. That said, I've learned way more about how to interact with Windows 8 on a tablet than I ever would have thought to try on a regular computer. It's very touch-based intuitive.And that's it.

Its audio, as some other reviewers mentioned, is strangely quiet.

Not having 100 iphone games on your work laptop, however, can also be a blessing!The #1 issue here that can actually be a major, prohibitive problem is that for some god forsaken reason Microsoft forces you to only use Internet Explorer and does not allow you to download any other browser. At first I didn't think this was a big deal, and boy was I wrong! Internet Explorer actually does NOT. FUNCTION. A TON OF THE TIME. especially if you visit any sites with apps, flash, complicated anything going on, and it is guaranteed to \"not respond\" at least once per hour. Very odd to choose this browser for such an otherwise slick and advanced piece of technology!Overall, however, I strongly recommend the Surface, particularly if you are a student and work is your priority, not games and internet.", "Title": "Perfect and Productive, with a few flaws", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "BikerJr \"bikerjr\"", "ReviewID": "R2HUIXOPB8HNXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was all set to purchase my Surface directly through the Microsoft website, then I got the brilliant idea to check amazon.  I got more bang for my buck, for sure!  the 32 gb and a type style keyboard on amazon were cheaper than the 16 gb and a touch style keyboard from Microsoft.I love what this tablet does because it is enough for me.  It does not do EVERYTHING a laptop and my Kindle Fire HD together could do, but those things it does it does WAY better.  starts up way faster than any laptop I've ever seen, and while my classmates are choosing their seats based on proximity to outlets, I am typing away and surfing the net without fear of losing power for a full 8 hours.  I can quickly switch from Excel, where i'm using functions to calculate answers for problems in my Financial Management class, to a scientific/graphing calculator app for those problems that can't be functioned in Excel.I can't watch my DVR recordings via dishanywhere, and the sling player app is $15, but I can make do with watching in on another mobile device for which there IS an app.  I can't seem to get my amazon prime content either, but i'm sure that's user error, or a function that will become more widely available eventually.one major advantage over the Kindle Fire (just addressing the tablet aspect of the device here) is the two cameras, and the ability to take video with sound.  since the Surface will typically be within arm's reach, watch for my kitties on AFV.  =)I love the tiles feature, and its customizability.  apps like weather channel and facebook can have bigger tiles so I can see notifications at a glance, while I've made the email app tile as small as possible, so i'm not broadcasting what I've received to anyone who is looking at my home screen.I love the touch screen password feature, but if you use that remember to clean your screen often, because with all the oils in our skin, repeated touch gestures can EASILY be seen in the residue we leave behind.I would suggest buying an anti-glare screen protector immediately.  it is MUCH easier on my eyes since I've installed one with a matte finish.  no glare from overhead lights or sunshine!  though it IS winter in my neck of the woods so that hasn't been much of a problem.i'm used to a split natural keyboard, so this tiny little thing is a little tough on my hands, but for light application such as status updates or typing reviews on amazon, it's just perfect.  my fingers have adjusted quickly and I rarely hit the wrong key.I love that the keyboard detaches quickly and reattaches easily.  very powerful magnets, you just get the keyboard close to the right position and it snaps into place.  and if you want to do no typing, just pop it off and set it aside.the built in stand on the back of course only works for landscape mode and of course in only one position, but with the non slip backing on the keyboard, you can push the stand in and rest the tablet/screen portion on something else to get the perfect angle for your viewing.if you're looking for a powerful laptop replacement, this is NOT what you want.  internet based games run slowly and aren't as responsive as on a traditional PC, it doesn't run Microsoft Access (but runs the rest of the suite including Outlook with the latest upgrade, free in the app store), and you CAN NOT install your own programs (like the plug in necessary to run dishanywhere on the device).  but if you want something with more day-to-day functionality than an e-reader and don't need all the bells and whistles of a traditional laptop, this is a great option.", "Title": "fantastic price", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Author": "J.

It needs a ton of Updates to have a functional operating system. This Surface was half made up and cast into this breathing world. The Updates rob the native hard drive of needed space. Have had this unit for less than ten days and I have had to install over 100 Updates. Every Update or new entry into the native hard drive detracts from its capacity. So the 32 Gbs capacity is a misleading lie.You can counter this gross misrepresentation of MicroSoft by installing external space via a MicroSDHC card of which I did. Now I have about 70 Gbs of hard drive space. And yes, Virginia you can save stuff to the MicroSDHC.The Surface will play AVI files. It will play MP4/MP3 files too. And it will not play a lot of stuff especially Linux native files in RT.It is nifty. Weighs a feather at 24/36 ounces. Comes with a very finely tuned keyboard that works wonderfully. Little kickstand is awesome.Surface by MicroSoft is superior to the iPad that is a dinosaur with no USB port for your content like music, movies, photo, etc. And iPad has no external storage capacity. Apple's credo: give far less and charge far more.This Surface can accommodate 128 Gbs flash drives in its USB port. Alack there is only one USB port. Geez, I like a mouse over the touch screen. It is guns or butter if you get my drift. The typical Device Manager doesn't work in RT as best as I can discern. Forget about an external DVD drive. You get a primitive MicroSoft Word. The operating system is very much like Windows 8 with Charms/Life Tiles. It is strictly a proprietary operating system for Windows. It works. Apple's iPad is the same thing but for Macintosh operating system.Am sure Apple will counter with extras and a lower price to be competitive with Android versions and more Surface like laptops/tablets.The biggest foible of this kind of device is that you have to leave it plugged in all the time. If not the battery will drain away. That is something these electronic makers are going to have to deal with.You can Tweeter (who would), FaceBook, YouTube, Yahoo/g:Mail, HotMail, OutlookMail. You can compose letters in Word, the standard of the world. The sound is better than reviewers have stated. I am very hard of hearing and audio on AVI files and on YouTube are easy for me to listen too without straining my ears.Bought this refurbished on eBay of all things because it was $199.99 with free shipping.

It's a sad day for a PC fan-boy when better MS Exchange connectivity comes with an I-Pad! I greatly miss Outlook and the RT Mail Ap that replaces it is universally seen at best as mediocre and uninspiring. And then, they removed all Ethernet support in Win 8.1! This is important where corps security concerns doesn't allow wireless. Bottom line, NOT all USB hardware will plug into a RT. I bought this primarily to connect to a corp mail through Ethernet - for that, it's a disappointing failure. The RT is only a fun toy for casual games.Software :-|Can't install anything; only phone-like apps but very limited selection. And, the ones that exist often don't really work. For example, Dropbox can only read and can't save any changes (believe it or not). Usually, I just use the browser. This is the biggest issue for me. I typically use TeamViewer to remote into a real computer (this is my RT's only real value - being able to remotely control a real computer). But, most video sites will not work (slightly better in 8.1 upgrade but too many other things have broken to get too excited), etc. Great for Netflix, simple games, and other distractions from work (to be truthful, the most popular things on phones as well). Every RT app available is also available for Android but only one of the apps on my Android phone is available on RT (a better mail program, Touchdown).UPDATE: The latest update includes OUTLOOK! OMG, yes MS Outlook has come to RT. This is such a big deal that it alone is worth 1 star to me. And oh, there are more of my needed aps available.Hardware :-(Audio and video ports no longer works, no cheap replacements for power adapter, things like speakers and touch screen occasionally go away (unit never dropped). I will have to send back under the warranty (and I'm coming to realize that I won't miss it). Speakers are loud but lose all their power by being directional and pointed to the sides. GPS is off by 500 yards and so not good for driving. Everything else is similarly unimpressive.The size of the upgrades to the new Surface 2 shows the limitations of the original RT hardware. And yet, even the 2's far better screen, cameras, two position kickstand, as well as multi-sensor, more accurate, and backlit keyboards (with BlueTooth option), not to mention being faster and thinner, the new RT still has the fundamental software problems. To quote ZDnet's James Kendrick \"The hardware of the Surface 2 looks good but it's the [unchanged] software that kills the deal for me. The Windows RT software to be exact.\" The RT is neither a full PC nor a full phone. I still use the RT for watching Hulu (which can't be seen free on a phone) and movies (I think a phone is a bit small for watching movies). But, I paid too much to get just that. I feel cheated. A full version of Microsoft Office (Home and Student 2013) AND a full version of Windows 8.1 versus the cut-down s*** on Windows RT can be found with the much better hardware (ZDNET agrees) in the ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop (this tablet beats the Surface 2 on almost every metric being faster, longer battery, lighter, and cheaper at $380).Documentation :-(There isn't any; you're completely on your own. At least the XBOX ONE comes with tutorials, but not the RT.OS / Metro :-|Better interface than I-pad but must often go to classic Windows to do many tasks (like MS Office). And, once there a mouse is often preferred. Metro feels like what Win 286 was originally aiming for before Bill saw the Mac's overlapping tiles. I've had a couple of touch screens in the past and always thought them useless until Metro - a touch based interface makes a big difference. :-) Alas, freeze ups are a bore and Aps stutter (such as with Bluetooth headphones). OS takes most of the boot drive so I must occasionally clean stuff off to keep it running. This is the best thing about RT but I've found it wasn't as important to me as I expected. In other words, if you don't like Metro (and I do), there's no point to Windows RT at all.In SummaryI was very excited about this thing when I bought it (I have a half dozen Win computers, three printers, not to mention a TV I spent more on than my car), but it has completely failed for most of the tasks I bought it for AND the hardware has not been reliable (unfair when reliability was one of it's selling points). My phones are about 20% bigger and more expensive with each new contract. I had hoped to be able to keep an old phone and put the savings toward a tablet. This thing has a GREAT interface (Metro) but the bottom line for me is that it simply doesn't work and doesn't work consistently. My Android Samsung S4 has many more apps, the aps have more options, they work better, and work together better. I'm coming to the conclusion that the best thing about my S4 is the OS. Perhaps, the problem wasn't the idea of a tablet but only of Windows RT. I know that most commenters will laugh at my hoping this would work as a business device, so consider yourself warned yet again about such a foolish idea. The 1 star rating partly comes from knowing that just a little more effort could have delivered a real corporate winner (yep, it's partly a sour grapes rating).ZDNET editors have called the Surface RT one of the year's bigget technology turkeys for being underpowered and overpriced, poorly timed, without sufficient apps that produced so little real value that even \"flashy dancers and scary schoolgirls\" could not sell them. Recent Microsoft ads define a \"real\" PC wholly as something that runs MS Office (clones don't count) without mentioning a real mail program or corporate access. There is no way today to access a shared Exchange calendar on either any phone OS or RT (and in other respects, phones do far more than RT). The large number of us finally figuring out MS dropped the ball here may be why the list price for the RT dropped 30% to $349 (so watch out for over list prices that occassionally show here...) and now you can get one for just $199 at Best Buy Black Friday. With no real market, Microsoft announced a $900 million \"inventory adjustment\" charge for its Surface RTs, parts and accessories. ZDNET says \"That's pretty much the killer stat that says something went terribly wrong.\" If some people's back-of-the-napkin calculations are right, Microsoft may be sitting on an inventory of 6 million unsold Surface RTs! For those who might comment on how unfair this review is, that's 6 million customers Microsoft was expecting who came to the same conclusion. BTW, here's the vendor letter (and I have a bunch of them) that was the final end to any remaining enthusiasm (and motivated me to upgrade my phone):Hi,Unfortunately, Microsoft has disabled the ability to get any current USB Ethernet Adapters working in Windows 8.1:[...]There is no known workaround at this time.We hope Microsoft will remove this limitation by the time Windows 8.1 ships, but don't see any evidence in that direction so far.Sorry for the bad news!support@plugable.zendesk.com", "Title": "Poor corp device and unreliable", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Benjamin Romero", "ReviewID": "RNIUEXVGYNFNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A productive tablet, useful and different.One can see a classic iPad and a intent of clone aka Android tablet; but with this tablet you got other point of view", "Title": "Productive, faster, diferent", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R2JO5S6D7JP2AH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The MS surface runs widows RT.

This is because of word, excel and powerpoint. Nothing on the ipad or android apps can compare to those and they make the surface feel like a laptop. The tablet as a whole is very fast smooth and enjoyable. I have not run into problems during my use. It is top quality inside and out.On the down side it does lack the huge application market that android and apple have but it is growing and I would imagine in short time most desired apps will exist for windows 8.

In my opinion the surface is a step closer to a real laptop than an Ipad which for the price of the two is desirable in my opinion.This is how I see the move from phone to computerSmart phones -> small tablets -> big tablets (ipad) -> surface -> laptop -> desktopWARNING THE PRICE LISTER HERE IS ABOVE MSRP!

I bought it mainly for the USB port, office 2013, and kickstand-keyboard combo.  Between the USB port and micro-SD slot, I have access to my movie/tv collection (two USB hard drives for 660GB total) on-the-go, anywhere.  I didn't want to lug those around with me, though, so I went on Amazon and got a 16GB micro-SD card with an adapter.  With this, I never have to go a car ride without a season of breaking bad, the walking dead, along with 4-7 movies at my fingertips, and hundreds more with my hard drives.  None of this would be possible on the iPad, mind you. The only thing I wish the surface did have was a direct USB connector, so I could just transfer data directly from my desktop to the Surface's hard drive, rather than having to use the micro-SD card and its adapter. The only thing a laptop has over the surface is the ability to run Windows 7 programs like iTunes, Google Chrome, etc.  This also can't run Java, but it does have flash (another win over the iPad), so it'll run things such as Hulu without you having to pay for Hulu Plus. I also watched a video on NewGrounds and that worked fine as if I was on a computer.When it comes to the kickstand-keyboard combo, I can't really say anything except Microsoft's tagline \"a laptop when you need it, a tablet when you don't\" Also, I haven't really used any of the office software other than word, but it definitely does what it's supposed to, and I can't think of any differences between the preview and full that I've noticed, but I've really just used the basic word processing (change size, font, etc.).One thing people say the iPad has over the Surface is its wealth of apps, but the only place I find the Window Store lacking is in Social Networking, which you don't really need because the screen size makes sites such as Facebook and Twitter easy and natural to use  Regardless, I'm sure these apps are already in development.  I also love a lot of the games like Jetpack Joyride and Flow, and the News apps like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. I also like the Live Tiles, and how you can turn Live Tile off for every app that uses it.  I also Like the multitasking part of the OS much better than iOS's, much more intuitive and easy to use.  Between multitasking and Live Tiles, I see a lot of potential in this new UI (User Interface), and now it's time for the developers to step up to the plate. I also like the way games will show up on Xbox Live, but I do like the iOS SmartGlass app better than the one the Windows Store offers.Bottom Line, the surface is an iPad meets a PC, and takes the best of both for the same price as the iPad.  I prefer Windows 8 RT to iOS for a device this size, and see no problem with the supposed `lack' of apps in the windows store.  I love the Surface, and I would recommend it to people of all ages in the market for a table/laptop.P.S. I have a jailbroken iPhone 4, and TetherMe, an app from Cydia, the jailbreak app store, won't work with the Surface It works for computers and other phones, but simply doesn't show up on the surface.  Any way to fix this would be greatly appreciated, and just beware to anyone planning on using tethering to give their Surface an internet connection.", "Title": "LOVE it!

When it comes to software, however, Microsoft might have compromised a bit too much to deliver this by the holiday. I firmly believe that in the future, all of the kinks will be sorted out, because the tablet is powerful enough to be a lead competitor on the market.

Since there is a newer version out, I got the older one for $275 and overall I am very pleased. The reviews on this product have, for the most part, been very accurate. It is very versatile, but the trade-off for  that versatility is that the Surface does not \"knock it out of the park\" in any one area. I needed both a new laptop (mine is on it's last legs) and a new tablet (I have the original Kindle Fire which is great for books and a few other things, but it isn't really a fully functioning tablet). However there is no way I could afford both. On top of that, I would have needed to purchase a new copy of MS Office with my next computer since mine is several versions old and maxed on installs. That started me on a search to see which, if any, tablets could run MS Office and lo and behold, I found the Surface. Is it fully functional as a laptop? No, but I CAN use it for most things - especially with the type cover and with MS Office pre-installed. Is it the BEST tablet? Again, no--as previous reviewers have noted, it is a bit bulky in the length and not as intuitive as I would like, but it is very functional overall. All in all for what I spent (about $350 with the type cover and with MS Office pre-installed) it was a great solution for right now. By using my Surface for most things, I'll be able to baby my computer along for a little bit longer and if/when it does go completely out of commission, l have something to use until I can replace it.

Can add an SDCARD - I added a 64GB SDcard.  Plenty of storage3.  Works with or without an internet connection - Chromebooks (I have one) require an internet connection.4.  After you upgrade to Windows 8.1, you have a full function Office (Outlook, Excel, Word, Powerpoint & OneNote)5.  Decent applications - You have access to the Microsoft store whose application list is growing.  If you have Gmail account, you can also add the Chrome applications so you have both Microsoft and Chrome applications6.  9 Hour battery life - If you're a student, the Microsoft Surface is perfect.  I take a 3 hour class every Saturday.  I had 75% of the battery left after my last class7.  Price - Including the keyboard and memory, I have $320 invested in mine.

It is more comparable to a Chromebook, but much more functional than a chromebook).2.  Apple and Google have many more applications available.  However, Microsoft has all the basics covered - Tumble, Twitter, Skype, Facebook, Internet Browser and many games.3.  You can only acquire software from Microsoft.

I bought mine refurbished, which cut the cost drastically.

I live across the street from a neighborhood, but have no immediate neighbors on either side of my house.

There are no settings to turn off certain signals or block them, or pick a certain signal to be the only ones allowed to connect. Why not?

I have owned the former and used the latter. Almost returned it after loading it and configuring it. Stuff froze up; however, I did the traditional thing and rebooted it. It took two minutes to load all the updates it had pending; afterwards, I saw more updates waiting in the Apps store. Rebooted again and it was off to the races, this thing has been rock solid ever since. Makes me wonder if that is part of the complaints.Pros:- It's very light and durable- Comes loaded with MS Office and 7 GB of Skydrive- Replaces a Kindle HD Fire and a laptop- Great video and audio quality- Impressive WiFi operations. Found my HP printer, added it, and downloaded the HP printer/scanner utility automatically.- The tiles are very useful and you find yourself using the apps and tiles more over time. This is great because you use the desktop less and less as you become familiar with the tiles.Cons:- Windows 8 RT has somewhat of high learning curve. Three days into it and I'm still figuring it out- The preloaded MS Office is a Windows RT derivative and there is some delay due to occassional freezing but I believe that is related to my WiFi. Lacks some of the page design features of regular MS Office 2010. It does have all the APA or MLA stuff needed for college though.- Both keyboard/sleeves are somewhat flimsy when sitting on your lap; buy the $139 dollar one it gives a little more support and put a medium sized book under it. Layout is much better than the rubber pad like one.- It's derivative of Outlook does not support POP (not sure if regular Windows 8 App does either). Had to go to my Microsoft account, configure my email there and then add it. Works great now but was a pain. There was a pop up that told me what to do by going to outlook.com which is an extension of your Microsoft account. This took some research on my own to figure out. In the end your email looks amazing especially if it has graphics in it but what a pain to get it there.- Will not run Windows Siverlight at this time.- Updates, you will need them to make sure everything you have loaded works. It's a no brainer with anything Windows based but still it was not suggested in the getting started stuff. Afterwards, this thing runs like a dream.- App Store. Does not have my mobile bank apps like I have for my iPhone or for my school. For now, you will have to go to the desktop and access via IE 10. The word is that more and more apps are being added, till then I will have a Surface and an iPhone. Would like to have Windows 8 Phone to keep it all straight but that for now would be a step down due to the lack of apps. Also, you cannot get to third party apps either through the App store i.e.iTunes, Google based stuff, etc. The Microsoft Rep showed me that this was possible with the Surface Pro, he had his Apple IOS apps on it. Would be awesome if the Surface RT could access and use them. It would be a definite iPad killer.Conclusion:This tablet has more potential but is limited by its App store and the reliance on it; RT should be opened up to 3rd party apps. It would be a major game changer like th Xbox 360 was. One thing the Chromebook has over this device is the interface capabilities with your Google accounts. Microsoft is getting there with their accounts but it is not as intuitive or forgiving as Google; however, when you learn how to use that account it is amazing what they have done. Also, Windows RT should be compatible with all MS apps since they are the most prevalent on the web.

Had to close MSIE and restart session.the Windows button that switches from tiled view to desktop view was also spastic. Had to use some unknown combo of sleep button on top to switch views. There is NO alternate browser in the store to download.WiFi connection was very erratic. Sitting 12 feet from brand new ASUS router, the connection would vary from 2 bars to 4 bars.

It's not meant to be a powerful or extensive OS. Rather, it's meant to be pretty locked down, much like iOS and Android are out of the box. Similar to those operating systems, it is possible to \"jailbreak\" RT, but I would question the value of doing so.You will not get the full Windows 8 experience out of this, because RT is not a full version of 8. I tried this as an experiment, because I was very unsure of an RT-based tablet based on reviews that I had already read, but I decided to give it a try anyway.Unfortunately, it didn't work out so well. Most of my concerns were validated by my experience with the Surface RT. It's a good idea, but not a particularly good implementation. RT seems incredibly limited, primarily due to the lack of a solid application base like iOS and Android enjoy. There is a noticeable lack of RT apps -- especially QUALITY apps -- to download, despite Microsoft's attempts to bolster development through the \"bounty\" program they attempted earlier this year.In addition to the app and functional limitations that I encountered, I had performance and stability issues with the Surface RT. I'm not sure exactly if it was a hardware issue with the Surface, or problems with RT itself. Either way, it got to an irritating level, so I ended up returning the Surface RT in favor of the Samsung 500T.Understand that I did not expect the Surface RT to perform comparably to the 500T. They're very different animals with very different objectives (aside from the fact that the Surface RT runs Windows RT, while the 500T runs a full version of Windows 8). When I returned the Surface, I got a little spoiled and bought the 500T as a more powerful option. Then I got even more spoiled and bought its big brother, the 700T, which is what I didn't want to do initially. I had considered the Surface Pro, but the 700T made the cut.tl;dr - The Surface RT faces more limitations than simply feature limitations. A lack of applications and power makes this device less appealing than its Android and iOS competitors.

Microsoft really must fix this because, HTML5 aside, most of the web seems to run on Adobe Flash. Also, some websites do not render perfectly in the Internet Explorer 10. I imagine that this will be worked out as more people surf with IE10. Microsoft's updates appear to be resolving this problem in stages.The reason that this is a limit is that you cannot use any other browser on the Windows RT except for IE10 (at this point, Microsoft may work this out in the future).Idea: it may be a great choice for kids.

I hope it helps for those who are planning to but a tablet. First thing is first, the cons for this tablet. Well I can honestly say there at some things on the tablet that were a bit, concerning that I wanted to point out. The camera in the tablet is not what I thought it would be like. It says 720p, but it seems a bit less than that. Secondly, the number of apps on the tablet are not as extensive as the number apps on the android market or on the iTunes store. Though I know that won't be a problem later when they make newer apps for this tablet since the store is a windows store and not android market or iTunes store. That's all on what I think they failed on the tablet. There a lot of things good about this tablet on the other hand. The sensitivity on the tablet is very accurate and quite maneuverable. The fact that you can type easily on the tablet shows how much effort Microsoft had on the touch screen. Another good thing about this tablet is that it has, depending on what you memory size you choose, built in memory that can be easily expanded with a micro SD card. The slot for the card is a bit hidden because it's under the kick stand. So let's say you got a 64gb surface you can possibly add 64gb more! That to me is worth more than 5 iPads considering the fact that you can't easily add more memory to an iPad. And lastly, this tablet has Microsoft office! For me this is a plus because I am a college student. It works better, faster, and sleeker than any other tablets I've seen, and I worked at a best buy and I had an iPad.", "Title": "Amazing!

For one, I feel really cheated out on the price.  Within a month after purchasing this at $499.00, Microsoft dropped the price down to $349.  I tried to get the difference back from the vendor, didn't work.  I guess I wouldn't mind having overpaid (not exactly) if I loved this device.  But I hate it.  It's very frustrating.  The applications don't work (can't sync my emails), loading pictures on it is slow...the machine is slow to respond....the touch system is sluggish and just plain difficult to use, the screen often freezes up, none of the printers I have at home works with RT (in fact, you'll see there's very few printers that will) on and on!

If you go on Microsoft's website you can see all the amazing features the Windows 8 OS and this revolutionairy product.  You wont know what a quality built device this is until you hold one yourself, it's solid.  The gorilla glass is great, the kickstand and housing are second to none in terms of design and durability, as I said you will realize this when you touch it yourself. You can accomplish more, do more and have more functionality than any other tablet computer on the market bar none.  Just read the specs, this is basically a fully functional computer in tablet form and even has a well built, self positioning, magnetically attachable keyboard that acts as a cover, with the kickstand proped out it's a full laptop with USB etc support.  Compare this to an Ipad....other than connecting the boring IOS to itunes you can't do much other than play a few games and you cannot connect anything to it other than a usb connector for your computer to transfer a few music files again via itunes if Apple is ok with your mp3's, AppleID etc.  The Microsoft Surface and Windows 8 are eons ahead of the comptition, if you don't believe the hype try one it will amaze you.

He thinks it's ok, but wishes he had bought a small laptop instead.  As for me, I hate this little thing--or, rather, I believe it hates me.  Here are a few of my grievances:1) Internet Explorer shuts down all the time and runs especially slow much of the time.  I can have 2 tabs open sometimes and it slows down significantly.2) The keyboard takes up far too much of the screen.  Even when minimized, it still takes up 50% of the screen when the unit is turned horizontally, leaving you very little room to see your content.3) My printer isn't compatible with the device.  Because this version of the Surface won't let you download any non-Microsoft content, it's not possible for me to download and install the driver.  I don't want to have to buy an entirely new printer just for this computer.4) The mouse disappears sometimes.  It just goes off-screen and won't reappear.  I can still scroll by using the touchscreen, but when I'm alternating between typing and using the mouse, this is very inconvenient.5) The Surface falls over a lot.  Its kickstand back isn't very helpful and there a few to no good lap desks for the unit.  I bought a cover for the cpu, but even with it on, it still likes to fall over.6) Typing is a pain.  I like what they were trying to do by giving you the detachable keyboard, but there are better versions of such keyboards already on the market for other brands.  Overall, typing on the Surface is slow and cumbersome.7) When held vertically, webpages don't fit properly--that is, you would have to scroll left and right in order to see full versions of the page you're trying to read.8) While the battery life is good, when it does finally run down it gives you NO warning and just shuts down.9) The touchscreen's ability to respond is OK, but frequently I use my (skinny) fingers to tap something and, instead, it \"reads\" the thing just below the area I tapped.  This seems to be a pretty consistent error.10) There's no HDMI port for me to connect the device to my tv to watch things like Netflix, Hulu, etc.11) Ergonomically speaking, there is just no comfortable way to hold the device.  I don't know why exactly that is, but it doesn't feel good in my hands when I'm trying to sit on the couch and use it.  Perhaps it's the dimensions?12) Windows 8 is a huge pain in my side.If I were to choose between this device and a small laptop, I'd choose the laptop right away.  We have found that my husband takes the tablet to his Ph.D. classes, since that's what he bought it for.  But, he ends up doing most of his actual homework on our old laptop making the Surface seem like a waste of money.", "Title": "How do I dislike thee?

Sarmiento", "ReviewID": "R37JCPJFJEWPVM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used to have the iPad 2 but got rid of I because I never used it. I finally got tired of carrying my MacBook around at school, so I thought I'd get the Surface because it comes with Microsoft Office. I read the CNET reviews and it seemed like it got a decent review, so I went ahead and got it. I am not a fan, and here's why.1. It runs SO slowly compared to the iPad. Not to mention that coming out of the box, it required about 60 updates which took forever to install. Also, mine came with a completely dead battery, which was new to me. At first I thought it was broken until I let it charge completely.2. The Microsoft app store is weak compared to the Amazon Kindle and Apple app stores. There's not much there that's even worth downloading. Thank goodness they have a Netflix and Facebook app, but a lot of hit games and apps aren't there.3. The RT version of Office isn't very useful for a college student, in all reality. I'm a finance student so I use Excel a lot. Excel for MO RT is a very watered down version that doesn't allow you to access ad-ins like data analysis and solver. Which makes Excel a much less powerful tool.4. The keyboard is really annoying. If you're like me and you're used to being able to type fast and without looking at the keyboard, forget it. The keys aren't really raised, so I end up hitting the keys either too hard or not hard enough to get the key to recognize that it's been touched. The auto-correct on the Surface is terrible. Whereas on my iPhone I can breeze through and it will catch most of what I'm trying to say, I constantly have to go back and retype on the Surface, so everything takes twice as long to type on the Surface. REALLY annoying when you're writing a paper in Word. I often detach the keyboard cover because it's just faster to use the touchscreen keyboard. Also, I despise the fuzzy coating on the keyboard. It's already getting worn out looking on the track pad and it attracts dust like no other.5. Might be a nit-picky thing on my part, but I wish the built in stand on the tablet was adjustable. Or is it, and I just don't know? It's a good angle if you're watching Netflix seated in front of it, but you can't type on the screen from that angle.Overall, might go back to the iPad and wait for Microsoft to come out with a better tablet that doesn't run the ridiculous price of the Pro version.", "Title": "Lacking", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Docintherock \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R3P76B7F2RZP8H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What's the deal with Surface RT?I really wanted to love this table but I find it lacking in many ways.It really has an amazing display and the build quality is great.

Netflix, Kindle Reader, and ESPN just to name a few a easy to use and super fast.4.  IT HAS THE STANDARD RDP APP!  As a system engineer this is huge for me.  Nothing runs as well or feel as good as the good old Remote Desktop Client.5.  This is the most well built tablet I have ever used.  I have used basically every major tablet on the market for work or pleasure, and this things build quality is miles ahead.  It really feels premium.Cons1.  It will not run everyday Windows applications.  If it is not a Metro app it won't work.2.  This app limitation extends to productivity, security, and work applications.  Symantec Endpoint doesn't have an installer for it, you can't install VMware vSphere client, and many other common work applications won't run.3.  The screen resolution is a bit low for multitasking.Overall i would highly recommend this, though now that the Surface 2 is out I would recommend spending the extra money on it unless you absolutely cannot afford it.

I have power point, word and one note which is perfect for my night classes which was my main reason to wanting the surface.  The price was way better that purchasing at a store where they wanted 350 without the keyboard and got it sixty dollars cheaper on amazon.  I didn't purchase the keyboard because I played with it at a local electronic store and I couldn't get over the fabric feel and the backing isn't protected, so I purchased a blu tooth keyboard that also had case that protected the back as well.Back to the hardware: At times it does lag, but its just a second or two its not like you are sitting there a good minute and staring at the screen.  The touch screen is nice, it sometimes grabs multiple things that you don't want but its nothing that bothers me.  Startup is fast and easy though you are required to join Windows sign up to get the most of your tablet.  The one major thing that bothers me is the lack of apps.  It would be nice to see Pandora and Amazon Instant Video on here eventually.  Other than that, this is a good tablet for Window lovers.Pros: Good screen quality, able to personalize home screen to your liking, good processing (not as strong as Surface 2 but that doesn't bother me at all), the usual standard programs I need, nice sound ( I don't need to blare everyone out of the room), touch screen has its moments but other wise clean strokes and taps, handy carry around on the go, fast internet (Internet Explorer only)Cons: App store missing some key apps that many enjoy, may not be likeable to those who are use to Apple tablets or Android.Overall I like this tablet a lot, its everything I need for school and I have a few games apps to enjoy it when I don't have to do any work.  I would like to point out that this is a tablet, although it has a desktop version it is not a desk top.  You cannot download third party applications from websites you must download all apps in the store.  I always hear people saying its a laptop, its a tablet, there is a difference.But as always you should go to your local electronic store and ask questions, look at reviews, watch videos and know its the right equipment for you.", "Title": "The perfect Gift", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "c.smith", "ReviewID": "R1L2OPC45U4LAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was pretty much set on getting a Samsung tablet, but wasn't quite sold on it.I don't know how I came across the Surface, but I did.

My wife likes it, but she was concerned about the headphone jack not working.  One channel was out.  I tried two other headphones, same thing.  I then pressed the case together at the headphone jack, the missing channel came on, releasing it, it goes back off.  I'm assuming a bad solder connection to the jack internally to the main board maybe?Next, she played with it but as I watched, the screen was pulsating bright and dim, bright and dim.  It was driving me nuts so I played with the display brightness and power settings, after a half hour of frustration I found if I turned off some of the energy settings it appeared to stop the annoying dim to bright pulsating.  Why would anyone default a product to this right out of the box!Over all, the text and items you must click to set it up are so small a finger will press multiple items confusing the selections, so it was many times of trial and error to finally get the set-ups done, (setting the time zone on the clock for example).  The unit forced her to make an email \"live.com\" account or it refused to continue on, that upset me but we did it just to humor Microsoft I guess.As for the headphone jack, I guess It's back to warranty repair...what a pain!  Also, the camera is junk, but others have noted that so no surprise.  Other than these things, I think she likes it enough to keep it, but I'm assuming it must be sent back in for repair first.

In my home there are two ipads, a mac, and a windows 7 laptop.I purchased this with no small amount of trepidation on 9/14/2013. I did not purchase it from Amazon, rather, I purchased from a reseller on ebay.After reading so many negative reviews, I was afraid to pull the trigger. But, I went on Youtube and watched RECENT reviews by ACTUAL USERS and they overwhelmingly seemed to indicate that this little tablet was a worthwhile investment.I knew going into this that Windows 8 \"RT\" was a \"hobbled\" version of Windows 8 and I couldn't use old windows 7 programs on this little guy. Only apps that can be downloaded from the Microsoft App store will work. But, if you think about it, this is very similar to the ipad. You cannot use Macintosh programs on the ipad - you can only use those apps which you can download from the Apple App store.It does help that Microsoft includes, for free, the Microsoft Office 2013 suite on the tablet!So, when I saw the refurbished 64gb model (32gb is just not enough for storage) WITH soft keyboard for $279 shipped on ebay - I took the plunge. I AM SO GLAD I DID!The build quality is ALMOST on par with Apple standards. Very nicely designed and executed. Feels great in the hand, and the built-in kickstand is a wonderful touch. Stays absolutely cool to the touch, even when plugged in to the charger.The screen is quite bright, colorful and contrasty. NO, it's not a retina screen, but it's clear and crisp.The soft touch keyboard works surprisingly well, and you even get audio \"clicks\" when you type (I'm sure that can be turned off if it bothers you - but I like it)A lot has been said about the Microsft App store being a barren wasteland. Well, while it does not match the quality and quantity of the Apple App store, it certainly has a lot of great apps and I am very impressed with the growing selection.Anyways, it has been three days and I am thoroughly enjoying this Surface RT. It allows me to experience the Windows 8 environment at a reasonable price - and more importantly, it's just a lot of fun to use!If you can get one on the cheap, I wouldn't hesitate to do so.

Microsoft support said I'd have to switch to the Surface Pro for them to work with it, which sucks since I live overseas and it will be over a month to mail it back and then get the new one.  I wish I had known about this incompatibility beforehand so i could have avoided this inconvenience.  Also, I've had insane difficulties with the internet and its not a connection issue because I've tried in three totally different locations to upload pictures to facebook, just as an example, and either it would refuse to upload or take several attempts/hours to get just a few to work.

Kloepfer", "ReviewID": "R26UZFE7XCWKVA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "INTRODUCTIONI recently purchased a Microsoft Surface RT for just $169 on Black Friday. Along with it I purchased a Type Cover on eBay for just $37. I paid not much more than $200 for a tablet beyond all other tablets in productivity. But really, is it even worth the $200 I paid for it? Is it really more productive? I'll do a review then answer those very questions.THE DISPLAYThis is one of the areas where the Surface RT shows itself as a more primitive and inferior tablet. While the colors are vibrant and viewing angles are good, the resolution is pixelated and it just isn't nearly as bright or colorful as an iPad's retina display or a Nexus 7 (scroll down the blog for more Nexus 7).PERFORMANCEThis is another area where the Surface struggles a bit. The Tegra 3 chip stutters frequently, and apps often take awhile to load. Most of the time, it is very fast, but you will notice that it is not nearly as fast as the competition.CAMERASYeah.... think of your flip phone you had 5 years ago, and this is WORSE. These are terrible cameras, and while you really shouldn't need to take pictures with a tablet anyway, these are terrible, and absolutely atrocious in comparison to the iPad's iSight cameras.WINDOWS RTI overall have been very impressed by Windows RT. While the Surface's hardware doesn't do it justice with it's slow processor and low-res screen, it has amazed me how similar it is to my Windows 8 desktop. It is fun to use and is very functional... as long as the apps are there.This is where the tablet become unproductive. The app store, while definitely growing, is still a fraction of what the Google Play Store and Apple App Store have.TYPE COVERThe Type Cover, while not nearly as easy and flawless as your normal keyboard, is a very nice keyboard in it's own right. Typing an email or a quick document should be just fine on this keyboard. You will still make errors, but this is miles better than the Touch Cover. The keys have a nice push to them and it feels very nice.SO, IS IT WORTH $200?Yes and no. if you need a tablet, and want to actually want to do work on it, then this is the best $200 anyone could spend. Even for the $350 you can find it for today. But, if you just want a tablet- and just a tablet for play and entertainment, then definitely look elsewhere. The Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HDX are great options.IS IT REALLY THAT PRODUCTIVE? It is... once again, if your lifestyle works for it. For most people, this will be a definite NO. But if you blog, type word documents on the go, or need a keyboard for anything else, you cannot beat the Surface.CONCLUSIONThis is a great tablet if you need a keyboard on the go or you need Microsoft Word. Otherwise, I cannot recommend it. The performance, the screen, and the operating system lag far behind other tablets, like the $229 dollar Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7.", "Title": "The Surface RT - The Productive, But Not Really Productive, Tablet", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R2BO6VSAEHPAYL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a very nice and handy computer but it's difficult to use it the first time because it does not come with a user guide or manual which can be very useful for people who are not really good in computers.

Even better why do they give it low scores for being something that it wasn't meant to be?  No, you can't run actual software on it but Microsoft didn't keep that a secret. Do your research and you won't have those issues. If you're going to give a device low marks do so based on the actual device and not the fact that you didn't do your research.Rant over and now to my review. I like the Surface RT a lot but I don't quite love it thus the 4 1/2 stars.  I bought it because it's light, portable and has Word, Excel etc.  I also got a great deal on it -$370 included the touch cover.  It's a beautiful tablet.  It feels good in the hands and is a solid device.  It powers on quickly too.  I have a Windows 8 desktop so my settings synced quite well.  The kickstand is a nice touch but like a lot of others I wish it was adjustable. There is no denying that this is a well designed device. I'm talking about actual hardware, not the OS.  I wish the speakers were better quality but they aren't horrible.  I'm pleased with the screen and I think it's a great ratio.  Watching movies on it is quite a bit better than other devices.  The OS is intuitive especially since I was already used to Windows 8. The Windows store is still very sparse.  I was hoping by now that it would have improved.  I've had the tablet a couple of weeks. The touch cover takes some time. I type very fast so it's a little aggravating but I'm doing better. The portability is amazing and is one of my favorite things about this tablet.  If you know what you're getting it's a fantastic device.  Just don't expect it to be something it's not.

She gives acting classes, and attends various courses, and wanted to be up to speed with her classmates, so I took her to Best Buy, and, since she is a windows user, we thought that this machine would have a familiar feel, and the learning curve wouldn't be too steep.We tried. For three full days we truly, and honestly tried to understand and like this machine. It's light, has a colorful screen and you can get on the internet. How fun!Well, try scrolling through a photo shoot; you need the precision of a neurosurgeon to hit the back and forward arrows. To hit anything! A link, a text bar. Terrible touch screen sensitivity! Try downloading a photo of your grandkids from an Email; you need to go and dig inside the operating system to the least obvious location and retrieve the jpg to then somehow place it inside the strange photo album app. Try moving back and forth between internet pages and apps; well, you need to learn an enormous list of super non-intuitive fingering commands that sometimes work, and sometimes don't.Oh, and they sell you a 16gb capacity machine, with a huge sign that claims 32 gigas!The placement of the home/windows button? Really? You have to hold the tablet in the most awkward manner to avoid accidentally leaving the page or window that you are on.The camera: 1 megapixel.....1 Megapixel!!!!You can get a better camera inside a cereal box now-a-days.Woke up on the third day, and found my mom sad and frustrated with this thing.

So if one app was above the age, it says a parent must be there. Since I was the one setting up, there was no easy way for me to give it permission. To date, I am still guessing how to make that work. I would think that a parent override would pop up to give it access, but no it doesn't. No where to go.The unit is great, but it is not for kids.

The idea of being productive in such a portable size is something many have tried and few have succeeded. In some ways, the Surface is a great device. But for every smart feature baked into it, there is a flaw that keeps it from being the device it set out to be.Let me start with Windows RT. It is basically a locked down version of Windows. Any application that you have used on your Windows machine in the past is INCOMPATIBLE. Apps must be (without a thorough understanding of development) installed through the Windows store, which does not contain many apps. This is probably the biggest flaw. I strongly recommend you look at the Windows Store catalogue before purchasing and see if the selection meets your requirements.On the plus side of that coin, the office suite is present, although with some subtractions. It would have been nice to see Outlook on the device for a more robust email experience, but at least the device comes with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote (and Lync if your employer uses it). The desktop experience is familiar, yet barren. With a mouse and keyboard connected via USB, it's easy to use the Office Suite (But there really isn't anything else to do in the standard Windows desktop- remember, no normal Windows applications can function). Without the peripherals (which are for the most part plug and play, like Windows of old), using the desktop is doable, but noticeably slower.The touch cover is really a genius idea. There is a learning curve, and I'd best describe typing on it to be like playing a piano mixed with the typewriter peck style of typing. Its expensive, but without it, the Surface just isn't the same. I wrote this review using it.The build quality of the actual device is excellent. It feels strong, and is comfortable to hold. With an iPad in one hand and the Surface in the other, I couldn't notice a big difference in weight. The magnesium it is built with feels high-quality and is soft to the touch. The screen resolution is lower than other devices, but it's still a very nice screen. Don't let that hang you up- the screen is just as usable as any other tablet. Microsoft really did their homework on manufacturing the device and touch cover.As far as the hardware goes, I've noticed occasional slow-downs using first party apps like Music and IE10. Of course, it's nothing worse than I've had with my 3rd gen iPad, but you'd think a quad core tablet could play music without a slowdown. All-in-all, I'd rate technical performance as good with occasional problems. Don't expect flawless operation, but don't expect it to suck.That last sentence really sums up the Surface is a nutshell. It can do a lot of things, some that are well thought out, some that need work. If you're looking for a hardcore productivity tablet, look into the actual Windows Pro tablets. If you are looking a device that can replace the functions 80% of people use for a computer, the Surface should at least garner your consideration, if not more. If you're looking for a consumable device (music, games, videos) without chops for productivity, look into the iPad or Kindle Fire HD.", "Title": "It could be great, but it isn't", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"Justin\"", "ReviewID": "R3C2SJ6TFRCB84", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I chose the Surface because of Office and Homegroup.

If there's not a forced update, the Surface locks up coming out of sleep mode and you need to restart it. Apps hang up and you need to restart. The screen looks great, but it can't figure out what you're touching, what you want to do, whether you just did a short press or long press. It is simply awful. To top it off, wireless connectivity is not strong and the surface is incredibly slow on wifi compared to my galaxy S5, which I have almost no complaints about.In short, I rated two stars in hopes that you'll take the review more seriously.

I have since bought a limited edition blue skulls design touch cover, as well as got a very good deal on a black TYPE Cover on eBay. So far, the Touch Cover has been much nicer than I expected. I thought the flat surface would be too hard to get used to, but amazingly, I have not made ANY typing mistakes, and I don't have to move slowly or make sure that I press each key. It seems to go very smoothly when I type just as fast as I do on my regular laptop. Not to mention the blue color and skulls artistic design is quite sharp! I have used this keyboard almost the whole time, and the Type Cover has been put away. Those who say to get the Type Cover must not have given a Touch Cover much of a chance. The only real positive difference in using a Type Cover would be if you desire the key-sounds and clicking of each key. I personally enjoy the quiet typing on my Touch Cover better.I bought this tablet because of the obvious perks of having the detachable keyboard, and the smooth, heavy-duty metal casing on the tablet, along with the handy USB port and expandable storage, as well as the key features I was looking for. I like the larger size, instead of the usual 7\" tablets. I am a loyal Windows user, but it is taking a while to try and get used to the very different Windows 8 RT interface. I wish I could make the Surface accept a Win7 OS.The WORST part about having the RT operating system, is that it will NOT accept any of the usual programs or allow you to install anything unless it comes from the very limited Microsoft App Store. I have had a very difficult time with finding good 'apps' to replace the programs I am used to using, especially a decent video player that will play more than just the .mp4 format. I also wanted to have PC games on my tablet that I already have on my PC, but I cannot install any of them. This program restriction is the Surface Tablet's biggest downfall.I have read on some website descriptions of this product (Walmart site being one of them) that after updating to Win8.1, the Surface can now run ANY programs that will run on Win7. I am confused by this, because the Surface has NEVER been able to run regular programs, as it will not allow any installation of anything using a .exe or other file extension. All it will do is allow you to browse the Windows Apps and select which of those to install. If ANYONE knows any more about this claim, please comment and let me know!So far, I haven't used my Surface for more than 12 hours since I bought it, and all the disappointments have turned me off of the excitement I had in first opening the box and trying it.I would give the operation and use of the tablet a 4/10.The sharp style, outer design, and nice keyboard options, as well as the VERY nice multi-use USB port, the availability of the expandable storage with the included micro-SD slot, and the handy 'kick-stand' on the back, I would give a 8/10.", "Title": "IF ONLY...", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Author": "Deborah Gridley", "ReviewID": "R1ABVEYSOT0G59", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Surface was very disappointing.

The ports worked like a charm. The Office dummied down for RT worked well. I was looking forward to using it.However, two things happened that really had me reeling back.First, Internet Explorer works great, but won't let you play some things on many website. Somehow it has blocked playing movies, videos, etc from sites they don't want you to access. And they are not x-rated sites!! They are competition sites!! Also, Microsoft has done what Apple did early... made IE proprietory to its RT system. No one else is/can develop an alternate downloadable/useable  browser for RT on the Surface. I cannot access my work messaging system because IE DOES.NOT.WORK in our system. Chrome and Firefox are taboo on the Surface RT.The other problem I have run across is one that caused me to have to send the unit to the warranty/repair place for Microsoft warranty work. My power adapter block and strange connector was fine, but the little light on the end of the connector which is supposed to light up when it is charging would not light up. Something internal in the tablet was fried. NO.CHARGING.NO.ERASING.PERSONAL.INFORMATION.NO.FIX.MUST.SEND.BACKSo I did. They sent me a prepaid address label by email. I got a new one in 5 to 7 days (don't remember exactly.) Had to enter account information and setup all apps again and put all my information essential to my business back in. Took a full day for updates, downloads, and other stuff.Windows 8 is another learning curve. For Windows users, it is a steep learning curve. If you have other app-type devices such as smart phones, it is not so bad. However, to set up a printer, set up the wifi, and even to turn off the device took a search on the internet on how to do it!! NO.WRITTEN.INSTRUCTIONS! I have been working with Windows 8 for about 6 months now. There is NO.INTUITIVE.REASONING on figuring out things. Just get another computer and search the web for the answer. Don't waste your time looking on the device to any intuitive/rational way of doing things. No wonder Microsoft is hurting so much!! No one can figure out how to even shut windows down!! Swipe left on the right side, touch the gear, choose the Power button symbol and then choose shut down.  Okay, four steps, all hidden from intuition or rational thinking!! Nothing like it before in Windows.Well, I had to vent. I look forward to when Surface RT and IE let the JavaScript or FlashPlayer or whatever let all videos/apps work on all website. And they encourage third party browsers to use RT as well.I really, really really want to like my Surface RT which I paid $499 for in June and then by August Microsoft was selling online for only $349!!!

Mine was loaded with Windows RT 8.1 and all the latest firmware and was quite speedy. Unlike others I noticed no lag when performing tasks.The full size USB port is an excellent feature. It has worked with usb drives and a powerpoint presenter.Size: Screen is a good size but the display is not as nice as my Samsung G2 phone.Cons:WINDOWS RT 8.1This has to be the worst operating system ever. Worse than Windows ME and much worse than VISTA. The operating system is not intuitive at all. There is no documentation included and little online explaining how to use it or set it up properly and the support is poor. Microsoft should provide a video tutorial on how to operate this with the product. The learning curve for Android is not as steep as this which should be easier being I use Windows 7 on a daily basis.A box showed up on the screen (something about how to switch between apps) and I could not get rid of it. So I googled the problem. Another person had the same problem and posted on a MS discussion forum. The answer the \"experts\" gave was read what it said. They couldn't answer the poor guy's question. I needed to figure it out by myself.Skype. If you are coming from Windows 7 or below or Android this new version of Skype is a disaster. First it makes you sign into a Microsoft account rather than your Skype account. Then it made me pick out my contacts out of a list of people I have no idea who they are. Tried to unlink the MS account with my Skype account but the instructions were so poor I could not follow them. Not only that my tablet now refers to me a Jen Fisher. LOL. Why it just doesn't ask for you Skype password and set up the app the same way you have it on other devices is beyond me. I guess that would be too simple and not cool.I an not entirely sure what happened but my best guess is that my account was compromised and used for spam. Jen Fisher was the name given to the account. I needed to reset the tablet back to factory specs and do the whole install again to get rid of Jen. I also set up a new account and needed to unlink or unmerge my Skype account from my Microsoft account. Again, why I need a Microsoft account for everything is beyond me. So my experience may not be typical.Camera. Both cameras seemed to work ok. However try to turn them off. Again no instructions. What ever happened to the little X to close an application or a back bar like Android has. Couldn't find any support online. I don't have this problem on my Android phone.Live Tiles: These are terrible. Hopefully there is a way to turn them off (there is). I could not find the Windows store because the I did not see the tile Microsoft shows on the website. Why? because it was displaying an advertisement. Critics complained about Amazon putting ads on the Kindle but this is worse. Why would the developers think it is cool to change the look of this? Note to developers, it is confusing. Evidently other people feel the same about the tiles as I do, Microsoft is supposed to delete them in the next update of Windows 8.1. People have complained about lack of a desktop but I did find that you can add it back easily by just pinning it from the apps to the start menu.Weight: It is heavy and difficult to hold for a long period of time. Also you need to watch where you hold it because if you touch the screen it reacts differently.I will keep updating this review as I use the product or until I return it.

Beggars can't be choosers but I don't know where to start with my disappointment.  First off, I often use an original iPad, iPad2 and iPad mini (when my kids don't have them squirreled away somewhere) but i'm also a windows fan and have had many many PC's/Laptops so I've got a good baseline set of expectations for windows and for a tablet.When I turned the tablet on I expected it to just work. Well, I set the username and password just fine and the primary color..but that's when the wheels fell off.  I could get online fairly easy but couldn't \"Activate Windows\" after an hour of trying, The error code I got simply said cannot activate windows at this time, try again later or contact Microsoft online for support\". I spent half a day on this before giving up.  I'm not even sure what this activation is for, maybe it was the big problem leading to my future issues ? Anyway, I attempted to get support online but the Surface support FAQ had no help for my basic questions other than to try what I've already tried and my attempts to open a \"Chat\" support session ended 30 minutes later after waiting and waiting for a text message to be sent to my phone to authenticate me (they had my cell # correct associated with my windows log in) but  - THE TEXT NEVER CAME -so after 30 mins I abandoned the effort and closed the window.  Still no text about a day later.  I figured I would try and access the Windows Store for games to see if I could download some games my kids play and I was surprised to see that I couldn't access the Windows store !!  It asked me to try again later <again> ??  I validated I was online via browser -but still not luck with the store.  This should be easy since we use our xBox Windows account all the time and buy/use stuff through the store.  So, then I tried to download one of my kids favorite games directly from the website to run directly and not as an APP.  I went to get the game Minecraft from the site directly, I saved the file to the machine, tried to open it - and Viola - I get the error \"this App isn't supported on this device\". Right about now I've just about given up on this thing but figured I could at least browse the internet with it...then i go online and start navigating to Google.com for news, etc. and see that on every single web page i get warning errors for Certificate Errors ? and warnings not to proceed.  On every single page I have to click a link to bypass the warning. On every single change in navigation I would get these Cert Errors.  And that was it.  I give up. For something retailing at $350 I expected it to just work.  Lesson learned.  the iPad figured this out years and years ago and it just works. IMHO Don't waste your time with the Surface RT.

This is really just a large phone that can't make calls, run programs and has almost no apps. There is hardly an app for anything in the Microsoft store and even less for the RT.

I am a student and needed something light that I could carry around to classes but this thing has done nothing but frustrate me.If you're considering making an investment on this, here are a few things you should consider:~The only web browser that you will be able to use on it is internet explorer.....just let that sink in.~You will not be able to use iTunes.~A couple of times a day, my surface has become unresponsive.~Absolutely not for....  -gaming  -watching DVDs  -downloading anything from a disk (unless you buy the attachable, which I think that things of this nature should definitely already come with a disk drive thing. if you're going to be spending money like this, why would you not get a device that has built ins? Cause you're dumb like me.)~You are restricted to only downloading things found in the app store, which is incredibly dissatisfying to me.Just know that this is a tablet. Not a laptop.

He and I tried it out for a couple days but in the end he decided to return the device.  We both agreed that it was a nice looking device, well built with all the necessary ports for future expansion.  Why then did he return it?What is it?  It's a lousy laptop and it's an even worse tablet.  My son's Kindle Fire HD has a much better tablet experience with tons more apps.  I really wish MS would have spent more time in advance of the release building out a suitable app store.  It's hard for me to make a $800+ investment in a device that may or may not have the apps I'm looking for.  Then again if you're main selling feature is to bank on MS Office then you should include the keyboard as part of the package.  All in all I probably would have kept the device and taken a chance if it was price around $400 with your choice of keyboard and color!We already have Office on a laptop so for now We'll keep using it. MS I was really hoping for a legitimate alternative but unfortunately for us it takes more than some cool TV adds to spend $600 - $800 on a device that's not ready for public deployment.I'm also interested in the Windows 8 phone but will hold off until they populate their app store.", "Title": "What is it?!?

Then everybody switched to Flash memory, and we've been stuck in the 32/64 rut for years. It doesn't have to be that way. Come on, Microsoft! Make the damn thing a millimeter thicker, and give us a proper 500GB drive! I'll buy the first phone or tablet that can give me that at a reasonable price.I suspect conspiracy.

I don't work for Microsoft, but I am a .NET programmer whose future is tied to that of Microsoft. I obviously wish them success. But I really really regret purchasing this thing.It is next to impossible to play music on an SD card. I had to go into the MS store to have them make that possible. The built in music app is so bad I can't begin to tell you, and there are no decent apps that let you play your own music.I've tried several different bluetooth headphones; they all stutter, hang, and generally don't perform properly. These are from major manufacturers and oh btw they work on Android devices just fine. There is no easy way in the OS to disconnect and reconnect bluetooth headphones.The few apps I can install hang regularly.I'm starting to rant, I realize, so I'll stop. It's just that right now I can't even restart the machine; restart itself is hanging!! I'm so mad I can't take it any more.Look ... I'm sure the Surface RT will be fine in a year or so, but in typical MS fashion they've released a beta version and are testing it out on YOU. There is no content yet in the app store, the built-in apps are the worst, and the usability is terrible. Go with the Surface Pro instead.", "Title": "Great Hardware. Awful OS and no software.
