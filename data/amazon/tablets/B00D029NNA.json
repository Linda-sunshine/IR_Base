{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Steve Cohan", "ReviewID": "R3TYEBCDT6GO5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I operated a computer company for about 25 years and have grown with the computer industry. This tablet is simply amazing because it is simple, yet complicated, and very reliable. I purchased this unit for three features, it's a Samsung, the microUSB interface and the IR capability. I have a 3 year old Samsung Droid phone and I love it. I am a photographer and wanted the ability to preview images in the field. The microUSB port gives me that capability. If you want to use the microUSB capability, an accessory is required, the Samsung micro USB/USB Connector. I bought mine at Fry's Electronics for $20. One end is micro USB for the tablet and the other is standard USB for things like card readers and flash drives. Caution: I attempted uploading images through the connector using a USB card reader but it failed. Then I tried a USB connection directly with the camera and it worked. I also purchased a more expensive card reader, the Vivitar 50-1, and was able to upload images with that reader. In other words, you may have to try a couple readers to find one compatible with the tablet. I also tried interfacing a notebook hard drive through the USB port but there wasn't enough juice to get the drive spinning. The tablet also has a 64GB storage limit on the removable microSD card.I am embarrassed to say that I moved to this unit from a Nook. I won't make a comparison because there is no comparison. They are two different worlds. If you buy this Samsung, download the free, companion Kies software from the Samsung Web site. It will enable you to move files back and forth from your desktop or laptop. You can do the same thing using the file browser on your computer. I was really concerned about my contacts in Microsoft Outlook. I have been through the \"moving contacts\" nightmare countless times with different devices. The Kies software found my Outlook .pst file on my desktop hard drive and imported it flawlessly. The format for contacts on the tablet is very nice.Using the My Files app built into the tablet, you can view all the folders on the tablet internal drive and external memory card in a tree format. You can move files, copy files, rename files, delete files and make and delete folders. If you are a power user, these features will appeal to you.It comes with Polaris, an Android version of Microsoft Office that is compatible, file wise, with Office. I have only used it to view Word attachments that I have received in emails. The printer in my office is set up for sharing on the office network. When I wanted to print an email, the Samsung tablet immediately found the printer and printed the email pronto. Slick.Audio: Until now, my earbud purchases were for cheapies at any discount store. However I was unhappy with the audio volume on the tablet when playing music videos. I did some earbud research and found some good reviews on a set of Marley buds that have a rocker switch for up and down volume and a mic button in the middle. When you press the mic button, the display changes to a voice input screen, perfect for asking a question. Apparently the buds are designed for the iPad as the volume switch does nothing. No big deal, I adjust volume on the display. The big deal is that I get so MUCH volume from these buds that I can't keep the volume at the highest level without breaking my ear drums. Also the audio quality itself is incredible. Get yourself a set of quality buds. I found these $60 buds on sale at Radio Shack for $25. The tablet has another cool feature, Adapt Sound which is found in the settings menu. When you start Adapt Sound a series of beeps will be transmitted to your buds or earphones so the tablet can perfectly adjust the audio to your hearing. This feature makes a huge difference in the sound.It comes with a free 2 year, 50GB subscription to Dropbox, a cloud utility. I am going on vacation next week to the middle of nowhere. I will be able to take images, and upload them to Dropbox using the Hotspot feature on the Samsung phone in conjunction with the tablet.I watched a youtube.com review of this unit and the guy was unboxing the tablet complaining about the display resolution, although he had not yet looked at the display. This unit has a VERY impressive display. My pictures look AWESOME and I have uploaded some videos for the plane portion of my trip. They look AWESOME too. The unit has a new dual core Intel processor enabling the videos to play flawlessly. I watched another youtube.com video comparing this unit with the iPad 4. The reviewer was talking about how much better the specs are on the iPad, and they are. However there is something called the real world. I am sure the iPad display is somewhat better. However, as a photographer I can tell you that the Samsung display is awesome. This same reviewer also mentioned that the Samsung slowed down. When? When he was playing games and watching movies at the same time. What? Some of the conclusions in online reviews are simply idiotic.I purchased the white version and the unit itself is pleasing to the eye. I use the voice feature for creating and responding to emails and it works very well. I mentioned the IR, infa red feature. You can control your tv's, Directv set top box, stereo and a whole bunch of other IR home entertainment stuff. The Directv app is awesome as it has a much more comprehensive guide format than that found on your TV.I have experienced 2 glitches with the unit when starting it up after it had charged all night. The first time it hung up and then corrected itself. The second time I had to reboot. That does not concern me as the unit operates 99.9% of the time perfectly.If you're a computer savvy business person or a computer newbie, I think that you will find this unit to be very user friendly and functionally appealing.I wanted to post more of a hands on review and I hope that you find it helpful. Would I purchase this unit again? Absolutely. I now have my day to day life in this thing and take it everywhere with me. It's a great personal assistant.Update on 9/17/2013: Just got back from a week trip with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Before I left for the trip, I rented 2 movies from my neighborhood movie store and converted them to MP4's using DVD Catalyst. Then I copied them to the 32GB chip I had in the tablet using the USB Connector that I mentioned earlier. I also did the same thing with 2 music DVD's. I had great entertainment on the 2 1/2 hour plane ride coming and going to my destination. I also ordered a 64GB chip but it didn't arrive before I left. A 32GB chip will give you plenty of room. I did discover a problem. Using the built in browser or Chrome, it is impossible to load Flash. I did find a simple solution and that is to purchase the app browser Puffin for $2.99 from the app store that is built into the tablet. It's a full-featured, super great browser and you'll have no issues with Flash. I'm thinking that a future firmware update will correct that issue but it is minor. I used the tablet for downloading images in my camera and it worked great. It downloads them into a folder, Imported Pictures, located in the internal memory of the tablet. I simply moved them to folders I had created in the microSD chip I had inserted into the tablet. While I was on my trip, a friend's wife became so excited about the tablet that we drove 100 miles to purchase one for her.", "Title": "AWESOME AND POWERFUL LITTLE COMPUTER", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1FMNJ77EYLUDE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! 7 and 8\" are ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I recommend the 8\". Samsung has made 8 and 7\" almost same weight. In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I gave 7\" a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10\" also a 4 star because of some strange feature `limitations'.  In my opinion, 8\" is ideal for consumer use and 10\" is marketed for specific segments in business who use for spreadsheets, presentations, remote desktop like Citrix GoToMeeting.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\" lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10\" Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare this specific 10.1in model to the previous Tab 2 version.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage or ROM, a microSD card slot (upto 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 ounces (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (upto 64 GB, 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and 10.9 ounce (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot, 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 10.1\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.I will compare the 10.1 Tab 3 with Tab 2.  Big improvement in weight, I would like the 10in series to break lower 400 grams ground.  This probably has to wait another 2-3 years. Another difference gtom previous gen is the processor. Intel Atom Z2560. Tablets are nowadays coming with Intel for their excellent power saving capabilities.  Asus Fonepad was one of the first to come out with a Intel based chipset. I really am waiting for the day the 10\" are even lightweight and holdable. The Tab 3 is 510 grams compared to 589 grams of Tab 2. Resolutions are same 1280 x 800 pixels, 10.1 inches (~149 ppi pixel density). The resolution is a same as in Tab 3 8\" which means 8\" will be sharper. I am disappointed with lower resolution on the 10\". One big puzzling factor for me with the premium price the 10\" has only 1 GB RAM. What the ?! Why can't they put a 2 GB RAM on this monster of a device. I really wonder what the design team had in mind. The Tab has - Dolby Surround sound enhancement, it does sound good! Both have Bluetooth 4.0\" and have USB Host. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless. Both have same camera 3.15 MP, 2048x1536 pixels and 720p@30fps.  Front facing is for skype. Again camera on 8\" is better, obviously Samsung thinks no one will hold a giant 10\" and take pictures. True and Point taken.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). 8 and 10.1in supports it, whereas 7in does not. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. Battery is humongous Non-removable Li-Po 6800 mAh battery in Galaxy Tab 3.  The one in previous model was 7000 mAh, this probably explains a slight drop in weight in Tab 3 10.1\". GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.For me the big downer has been screen resolution and RAM Size. Intel chipset has some weirdness as not all apps works properly. Firefox does not work on Inten based Android tablets as of June 2013. All apps are written for ARM processors. So for Intel, a layering has to be added to convert apps to work. This causes some apps to crash and has some weirdness. This is definitely not to alarm, but you should be aware of this. If an app works in 8\" and not on 10\" it is most likely due to the chipset difference. I would have waited for Intel to come out with their own chip based tablets, markets to stabilize on Intel chipsets and them Samsung to introduce it. I am sure Intel and Samsung struck a sweet deal.Believe me, but don't get mired in the spec game. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes. Sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets! I would say go from budget and size. If budget is not a concern, I would say go for Samsung Tab 8\". 8\" is a sweet spot. If budget is a concern, Tab 3 7\" is awesome, otherwise get the Tab 8. If you are business user, most likely the company will give the 10\" tablet.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wofram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate.

Highly recommended in form and function.", "Title": "Great all around tablet!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R1U6YFMX5ZPDDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a wonderful WiFi tablet! I love my Tab 3 10.1, as it is just what I wanted in every way, so I just had to share my positive experiences with the Tab 3 10.1 with you. You see I own the Tab 3 10.1 3G version (with the phone part and the ability to get data). These are the same tablet with one exception: The P5200 one has a SIM slot and therefore you can make phone calls and get onto the Internet with your data plan should you have a data plan.This one is a WiFi only one with no Sim card slot. Both work just great and are the same tablet, but this is WiFi.PROS:+ Screen Resolution/Weight/Size etc - The first thing I noticed is that side by side (comparing the Tab 2 10.1 and Tab 3 10.1 in weight and size is that the Tab 3 has same screen size, but overall size is a bit smaller and it is so much LIGHTER and easy to carry around than my old Tab 2 10.1! This model has a very colorful and vivid screen. In fact, I can now comfortably hold it in one hand to read a book in portrait, so I appreciate this Tab 3 of being less in weight! And I love the HOME BUTTON.Note: To take a quick Screen Shot, press the Home Button (and hold it down) and press the Power Button. You will hear the click of the camera. Your screen shot is in MyFiles under Pictures, Screenshots.This is so handy if you want to take a picture of say a quick map or something like that...+ WiFi Connection and Range - This tablet is AMAZING at how quickly it connects to my home router or other hot spots - just seconds! And there is a very strong signal on the WiFi on this tablet. So I went outside in the backyard and had 3.5 stars.+ OS - Jelly Bean 4.2.2 comes with this unit, I find very easy to use and this tablet is very fast in opening apps, going  to Websites etc.+ Ability to turn off the apps I did not want (helped my battery life). Did an actual test today to see if this made a difference and it did. After I safely turned off the apps that are safe to turn off, I now have more free memory and my battery life per hour has increased. So I documented this. If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comment section. Just a little tweak like this can really make a difference in battery lasting longer and better control over the memory etc.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser and installed archived flash so I have great internet flash video viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline.+ Watching Flash Videos - This device does not come with installed flash, however, I found a workaround to solve this. So if you request it in the comments, I will send you instructions on how to installed Archived Flash so you can watch flash videos and what proper browsers I recommend for this tablet...The only browsers that I could get the Archived Flash to play on and well was Maxthon Browser or Puffin Browser for 2.99 in the Playstore.Other Browsers I use when not watching flash: When I want to NOT watch flash, I like Boat Mini or Opera Mini because they use LESS BATTERY and LESS MEMORY, but they are just quick and basic browsers.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD up to 64GB - Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area.+ On-Screen Keyboard / Bluetooth Keyboard Stand I suggest - The on-screen one is so so, however, I use the OXA Bluetooth Keyboard and it basically turns my Tab 3 into a mini laptop as I can get some serious work done on this tablet (using Kingsoft Office for creating Word, Excel etc docs) with it and it types much like my regular laptop keyboard does so I love it! And it has an built in stand for my Tab 3 and it fits my other tablets. This lets me fold my tablet down in it and I keep them both in a 10 inch sleeve.If you want the link for this keyboard (it came from Amazon) and also I have another Bluetooth one I like with this tablet that uses AA batteries, but the OXA is by far the one I use DAILY!!!+ Bluetooth Accessories - The speaker on this tablet is pretty good. However, I use a very good mid sized Bluetooth Speaker with it to play my music and to watch my movies etc that also came from Amazon. The sound is superb with this Bluetooth Speaker. For best enjoyment of music, a Bluetooth speaker is recommended for this tablet. Let me know if you need my list of accessories for this tablet including Bluetooth items. Every Bluetooth item such as keyboards, speakers or headsets, and other Bluetooth devices, paired and connected to this device right away with no problems.+ Camera / Video Camera - Although I do not use this as a regular camera (no flash and low resolution), I went outside and took some very clear pictures, I was pleased with the results! Then I took some videos inside and outside to test this and they are much clearer than I thought they would be. So in a pinch, I will use this as as camera.+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a So So Office app (viewer) for reading Office documents, however, I STILL prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is good, but I use a very high quality Bluetooth speaker for great sound! Suggestions: The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!+ Battery Life- Since I have done a few tweaks on this tablet, now I have found that my battery life is better than the first and even the second day. In fact, the battery life now I find that when I use WiFi just when I need it, I now get about 6 to 8 hours with it(this reflects 100 percent brightness however). Still this is better than I received on my older Tab 2, so I am happy.***Where battery life is concerned: To make your battery last as long as possible is to be sure to turn off BLUETOOTH AND WIFI when you do not need these. Both are these are memory hogs! Also, I turn off my GPS and even SYNC sometimes to conserve battery and then turn them on later.+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab Pro). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the TabPro because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab Pro and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab Pro and from Tab Pro to PC--what a time-saver.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth keyboard I own paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there will be Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab Pro coming soon. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB Pro 10.1 size).CONS: (Just one con I found, however, this con is NOT the fault of Samsung)- New Adobe Flash is not supported; however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos.Bottom line: Would I buy this combo phone and tablet model over again? Yes in a heartbeat as it has a VIVID and CLEAR display, this tablet is also very responsive and has even exceeded my expectations of it. This is a wonderful tablet and I like the fact that the OS looks like other Android OS like the S3 and S4 etc. Should you consider purchasing this tablet? In my opinion YES if you have Android tablet experience and want to have these nice pros!Well, I hope that this review has been of help to you and thank you for reading it.

The speed is adequate for everything I've done with it. I watched the America's Cup races on youtube with it last night.BATTERY: I've also read that the battery life sucks. This has not been my experience. The battery life is far better than what I see with my laptop.SCREEN RESOLUTION: The resolution is fine. If you want to lug around an HDMI TV this is not the tablet, but the resolution is very much in the acceptable range.CAMERA: The camera takes ok pictures, and is more geared towards video chat. Have you seen that one guy taking pictures with a tablet? Yeah, you don't want to be that guy. Go buy a cheap camera. That's not what the tablet is for.SUMMATION: It's very much worth the money.

I've discovered \"Stephanie\" - well, that's what I call Galaxy's answer to Siri. I may never have to type again. Absolutely love this Galaxy. Compared to the Win 8.1 tablet, this just shines especially with ease of use. BUT, my wife loves the fact that she can use MS Office on the other Windows tablet. That's what makes the world go round.***Background: I've never had a smart phone, so the basics of a tablet are/were foreign to me. I've never had a tablet, and when my 12 year old XP laptop finally was just too slow (three days to boot up, and two seconds to die), I knew my time had come. The closest thing to a tablet was my first generation Kindle Fire(s), and that is no tablet.I'm as close to being retired as one can get. I spend most of my time hiking in the hills near our home or traveling to western national parks. I always have my camera with me, and on a \"good\" day will take over 500 photos. I come home, plug the SDHC card into my Win 7 PC, and cull and edit (mostly crop) what's left.What my wife and I wanted was a tablet that we could take on vacation, and view our day's shoot, delete the obvious, and leave the rest on the card for editing when we get home.You'd think that would be an easy function to accomplish, but as with the \"paradox of choice,\" It wasn't. I would liked to have gone to the Kindle Fire HDX 8\" with 32 GB, but there's no way to view photos. Without a micro SD slot  and not being able to use the micro slot (used for charging and hooking up to a PC) for a card reader, the Kindle becomes once again an e-book reader. (All this confirmed by Amazon.)As I was trying to find the best tablet, i.e., one with a micro-USB slot, I also started thinking that I wanted access to all my Kindle books and apps. Long story short: the Galaxy Tab 3 fit the bill almost to a \"T.\" The only problem was that I didn't know how to use a tablet.I got the Galaxy Tab 3 at BBY where Samsung has a \"station\" and a very knowledgeable staff. The price was the same as Amazon, and the convenience of having them set it up in 45 minutes while I watched was too much to pass up. I did get a very nice case from Amazon to protect my investment. The cass is importantOnce I played around with it, and of course, plugged in a micro-mini SDHC card with all my music, I got the hang of things very quickly. All my books are accessible, and I also downloaded the 12 apps I use most often, using the AmazonApp app, the Kindle app and the other Amazon app (or was that one a widget?).Being retired, I don't need much. (All software such as ACDC, Word, Excel, and Eudora Pro are on my PC.) I wanted speed, a larger screen, and wi-fi access. When we're on vacation, I will use wi-fi access at a motel or lodge for checking the news periodically, but mostly it's photography, app word games, and reading. And I have an emergency email account, and an old cell phone in the car.PROS: There are many pros to the Galaxy Tab 3, the first one being the micro SD slot. My wife and I have the same cameras, and can also used a 64 GB micro-mini SDHC Class 10 card in them (enough for two week vacations usually), and read directly with the micro SD slot OR plug in a card reader using a micro USB plug to USB 2.0 reader. It's fast enough though the slot is much faster. We can delete the obvious failures, and put the cards back in the cameras for the next day's shooting.Battery life is about 10 hours! In my experience with all things rechargeable, that's incredible!I haven't found all the capabilities yet. This is a simple, yet complex tablet, and there's much to learn. But I know which apps I'll use and which can be hidden (some can't be deleted), and which widgets are useful. While I won't take pictures with the Galaxy, I will use the tablet for Skyping friends and family all over the world. As a retiree, I also use the planner for doctor's appointments, play music all the time (I have wondered why have a PC, and then I remember I still have a few clients, and a corporate email program), and even watch a little TV ... or have it handy while watching real TV when I need information from Wiki or Google etc. The Galaxy Tab 3 is 5 times faster than my Kindle Fire.CONS: Any cons? Yes, four at least.First, the screen is a bit bright for reading, although I can manually darken it. The auto-bright feature doesn't work all that well. On the other hand, I do love ready my Kindle books on a 10 inch screen.Second, the 10 inch tablet, though light enough, is a bit unwieldy. The Kindle 7 or 8 is more comfortable. On the other hand, I bought a MoKo Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Case for $20, and it has a \"handle\" on the back which makes holding the tablet comfortable and easy.Third, there are three navigation buttons on the bottom or, if held in portrait mode, on the left. My thumb is - so far - constantly touching either the \"Back,\" \"Home,\" or \"Menu\" button. That is annoying especially when the tablet goes to a different page when you're online, or reading a book, etc.Last, there is no Mute button or volume control that is easily accessible. Yes, there is a volume control on the top left (if in landscape mode) between the SD slot and the Off button. I would like a shortcut on the screen to control volume (also complain I have about the old Kindle). It seems that Samsung thinks that the tablet should work like a smart phone and that automatically muting when a call comes in will solve everyone's problem. If anyone knows of an app that will mute or control the volume easily, please let me know. I've tried 11 Volume Apps - all evidently made for muting when a call is being received - and none of them work.Mini-Issue: Why is the brown (mine's black) more expensive than white??? I know that white makes reading more difficult because of contrast, and it gets dirty faster, but 90% of both will be in a leather case anyway.Originally, I was going to give this 5 stars, but that was because having a real tablet was a unique and (almost) enjoyable experience. I focused on what was so great, and not the issues that would and do bug me. So, it's 4 stars from me though if I were to do it over again, I'd still get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1.Footnote: In a couple of weeks, I'll have more than a Kindle to compare it to. The day after I bought the Galaxy, I was given an 8 inch tablet with 32GB. Stay tuned.ew", "Title": "New to tablets like me? This review may help. Voice recognition is fantastic!", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "Sin Jeong-hun", "ReviewID": "RM7LQGVI0IGC3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received GT 3 10.1 today. I have been using GT 10.1 for two years (I bought it on June 2011), and I liked the rounded edge and hair-lined back (feels good)  and the bright and colourful screen. That is why I bought GT 3 10.1 again. Meanwhile I had bought Nexus 10 and Xperia Tablet Z but sold them all soon, because Nexus 10 had washed-out colour and Z had yellowish screen (of course, they are not the only reasons).Now, I knew GT 3 10.1 had the same resolution of screen. All I wanted was just the same screen as that of my 2-year old GT 10.1. But alas, who would have guessed it. The screen totally sucks. First of all, it is yellowish. I guess it is not as yellowish as that of Z, but still. Why the hell a new model's screen is worse than two-year old model? Not only the screen is yellowish, but somehow the text looks blurry. I think it is not because of the resolution, because my GT 10.1 had the same resolution. On GT 3 10.1 text look like text on a CRT monitor. I cannot explain it with words...And haptic (vibration) motor is gone. Vibration was one of the few reasons I chose Samsung tablets because Nexus 7 and Z did not have it. GT 10.1 had haptic motor and why is it gone in GT 3 10.1. I know it is $100 cheap, but COME ON... I did not intentionally buy $100 cheaper model, but because Samsung DID NOT sell high-end 10.1 tablet model. (Galaxy Note 10.1 is too heavy and already 1-year old).As I saw on YouTube the two capacitive buttons are way too large. I mean, if the x in the next figure is the actual button location, touching anywhere on the underlined area registers as touch. ____x_____  It may be OK if you use it laying down, but if you hold it one had (and the other is for touching the screen), the middle is where you hold the tablet, and there are overly sensitive touch buttons. This is ridiculous. I think only the actual button position should work not the extra area around the button.I thought I was going to use it as a remote controller for my fan. But the bundled app only supported TVs and media players. It did not have any custom device mode that allows me to register a button by recording from a remote controller (Z's bundles software allowed it). I searched Play Store but surprisingly, there was any such app. All I found were TV controllers and some stupid apps that did not even support horizontal orientation. I also saw some ridiculously overpriced apps (like $50?) for IR control, but I did not buy it. I think I am going to write my own software for that and upload it to Google Play (I had registered as a developer).The edge is not rounded as much as GT 10.1. It is still better than the stupid edged Z, but still, worse than GT 10.1. GT 10.1 feels much better when holding it in hands.Camera sucks, it does not even have autofocus which GT 10.1 had. That is, it is even down-spec'ed from a two-year old predecessor. Of course flash is also gone. All these for $100? Damn it, Samsung. I would have happily paid $100 more if you made GT 3 10.1 a premium device, not a cheap model like it is.Now, let's see the bright sides...1) Speakers are a bit louder than that of GT 10.1. Louder but not noticeably better.2) Physical home button makes it easy to turn on the tablet when it is laying down.3) MicroSD card works fine. GT 10.1 did not have MicroSD.4) It is not as super fast, but definitely faster than GT 10.1. GT 10.1 is too slow now... This new model also plays 1080p fine. I tried many files and all files played fine. GT 10.1 could only play 720p files (except some 1080p WMV files). I knew that it did not have fast CPU, but I think the performance is OK for general use. So far, so good.5) No special charger is needed. Just using the charger for Galaxy Nexus  worked.I will update for more information after using it for a few more days.====Update : 24th November, 2013=====Initially I was trying to sell it but failed, so I have used it for about 5 months so far. Maybe it is something like a Stockholm syndrome, but I do not hate it now as much as I hated it first.My GT 10.1 started show weird strains on the screen, so for the last few months, I did not use it but used GT 3 10.1. I use it almost everyday to watch videos and YouTube. I do have an iPad 3, but it is too heavy and difficult to transfer files to. Maybe my eyes have been adjusted to the screen of GT 3 10.1. Now it does not look as yellowish as it seemed before. It is generally OK, and wow now the price is dropped by $100. At that point, I cannot complain much.The points I appreciate about GT 3. 10.1 after using it for 5 months:0. It is light. Not lighter than the new iPad Air, but it is still one of the lightest 10.1-inch tablet. I carry it when I go out, and it does not hurt my shoulder noticeably.1. OK performance. Not super fast and there are some delays when switching between apps, but it performs quite fast and fluid. Maybe not good for demanding 3D games, though.2. MicroSD card with NTFS support.3. Build quality. Well I cannot say GT 3 10.1 is perfect, but there are not many alternatives at this price point.  - All unbranded Chinese 10-inch tablets : I avoid it, because it gets no software supports from anywhere. They usually have really bad displays, lousy build qualities.  - Nexus 10 : Too heavy, with no expansion slot.  - iPad : Um, I need an Android tablet.  - Kindle fire : Too small. I want 10+.  - Tablet Z, Transformer something : pricier than GT 3 10.1, have yellowish screens, etc.  - Note 10.1 2014 edition : I tested it and it was sluggish. My GT 3 10.1's screen was brighter than that of Note 10.1 2014 edition (I compared it with my own eyes).But here are my complaints about GT 3 10.1 after using it for 5 months:0. The back/menu buttons' sensitivity still bothers me. I really wish all three buttons were mechanical buttons OR they were on the right margin of the device with some extra margin to grip on, like B&N;'s Nook HD+.1. Notification menu seems stupid. It does not utilise the large screen. GT 3 10.1 has wide width, but narrow height, so if I were the engineers, I would have made the items into two columns. The items appear too wide, and since it has narrow height, I often have to scroll down to see other items.2. Lack of a notification LED. I really wonder why they did not put this? My GS 3 has it, and it is very helpful to see if it is charging, any new messages. How much does it cost anyway to put a small LED lamp?3. The back is too slippery.  GT 10.1 has hairlines and not slippery at all. How much does it cost to put hairlines on the back, seriously?4. Google Now. Since its home button is a physical button I cannot use swipe it up to start Google Now. I wish I could map home button double click to Google Now, but I cannot.

This tablet looks a lot like it except for the navigation buttons are on the frame and they give you a home button just like the one on your Galaxy 3 or 4 phone.  That is a great feature!My other love for this tablet over the first generation is the SD card slot.  I never had one with my last one and was constantly running out of space because I like to put movies on it.  Yes I have heard of the cloud!  But sometimes you don't have internet access, or if visiting others you don't want to intrude.  So I appreciate that I can get a 64gb more space.When I got this right out of the box and signed in, it brought over all the apps from my old tablet automatically.  I don't know if this is good or bad... some people might have wanted to make a fresh start.  Seeing them all come in I realized I had too much junk on my last one.  So it provided me with the chore of weeding through my mess to clean it up.Uses the same charging cord as my Samsung phone.  Handy.Came with some preloaded apps and I love the Peel Smart remote.  It appears to work with any TV, even our 10 year old Visio.  Amazing.Even with all my old apps on this it works fast and cleanly.  My old tablet sometimes felt a little bogged down but usually that is resolved by killing tasks with the task manager.... but this tablet feels a little more responsive over all, there is no hesitation with it even with my apps all loaded.Bottom line is I like it.  Is it a radical change from my last (really old) tablet?  Not exactly but these little improvements go a long way to make it an enjoyable device.

My reasons for purchasing this tablet over others is it's perfect for me as both a musician and a Samsung Galaxy smartphone owner.My primary reason for choosing this over other brands is because I own a Galaxy Note 3 phone and the interfaces are identical. I did try out some other brands, all of where were nice and some better than this one (specifically the Lenovo Yoga Multimode 10-inch Tablet), but I wanted something familiar. My reason for choosing this over another Samsung model - the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8-Inch - which was actually faster, had better screen resolution and the ability to split the screen is the extra 2.1 inches on this one. It made a difference when it came to reading the screen. I am 65 and my eyes are not what they once were.I will admit that I was a little disappointed in the memory. My Galaxy Note 3 phone has 32GB of internal memory whereas this tablet only has 16GB. That disappointment is offset - to a degree - by the fact that this will accept a 64GB SD card like my phone. I am using a fairly inexpensive (compared to the Samsung brand) card that works perfectly: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card.Since I am not using any apps that will tax the relatively weak processor (compared to many other tablets from both Samsung and competitors) I can live with that aspect. If I were looking for power I would have gone with the Tab 3 8 inch. My main app on this is a relatively simple one called iReal Pro Music Book & Play Along.Another selling point for me is the battery life. The 6800 mAh capacity allows me to go an easy six hours between charges. No gig is that long, so it's perfect. The specs claim eight hours, but I have never gotten more than seven.  I am not wild about the fact that the battery is sealed like the iPad, but it was one of the compromises I knowingly made when I purchased it.One other thing that took some getting accustomed to is the fact that the buttons and controls are set up for landscape use. This makes perfect sense, but coming from a phone to a tablet the orientation does have a learning curve.For musicians here is a tip: you can mount this on some music stands using an Aleratec Universal Tablet Car Headrest Mount Holder. See my review of that product for details.Bottom line: this is not the best tablet for power users, nor does it have the best display.

I wish they would just put a kickstand on it as I haven't found a cover that I like overall yet and don't think I'll even try any others.Like some other reviews I'm disappointed in the layout of the menu and back buttons while holding it. It's too easy to swipe them accidentally and I've actually started using it upside down but it's a poor remedy. This is the reason it's not a 5 star rating.

Loading up a few apps makes you realize that a tablet that merely looks good is not enough. Try Skype and you will find that the thing can't do it, what is more googling \"Skype Samsung Galaxy Tab 3\" and you'll see that thousands of others have complained about this too. So OK you might say, so much for communicating with Grandma - lets try something else. You then load up an app to watch videos from europe, well that doesn't work either. OK so now lets try watching a flash video online - well outta luck there too.So far all the reasons for buying this tablet have evaporated, and in typical Samsung style they don't give a f*** that their user experience sucks. As you try to figure out what is wrong you start looking at what is under the hood, and you realize that this tablet is exactly the same as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 except that they downgraded the processor to some junky intel thing that  causes shorter battery life.So my recommendation give this tablet a wide berth and if you are unfortunate enough to have bought one, return it quickly. So in short this would have received 4 stars if any of the applications I had bought this for had worked. If they had put in a decent processor rather than this intel Atom thing then it might have received 5 stars.

Since we only paid $300 when compared with $500 iPad, I thought that we had to deal with these issues. My wife somehow managed it for six months. After six months, we could not charge the Galaxy tab. We contacted the Samsung repair. It took us three calls to get the shipping label for shipping our tablet to the repair center. After two weeks, I got a call from Samsung that we need to pay $150 ( half of what we paid ) to get our tablet fixed. She said that the charging unit of tablet was damaged. If we broke the glass or caused physical damage to the tablet, then I could understand it. How can we damage the charging unit ? She told me that she did not have enough information; she was only there to collect $150 or ship back our tablet.I suggest that you stay away from this tablet.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, so the sync capability obviously is a key part of the experience.  I am an Android user and wanted a tablet with an Intel processor, so this tablet was perfect for me.  I am not a very 'techy' person, so i actually let this sit in it's box for over a month before i decided to go through the typical painful set-up process.  However, this tablet was VERY quick and easy to set-up and sync to my Google accounts, etc.  I didn't even have to ask my husband to help, as normally when I get a new phone, i give it to him to set up for me.  The tablet interface is easy to use, my only complaint is I can't minimize or shrink windows so to have multiple windows side-by-side.  Or if there is a way to do this, i haven't figured it out yet.  But you can obviously have multiple aps running at the same time, and easy to move between them.  It's nice to have the larger screen to do all the normal multi-tasking I would use my phone for.  Example is last week I was sitting on my couch, watching Thurs night football, using the tablet to monitor my fantasy football team, was also doing online Christmas shopping, managing Sonos (playing in the background), catching up w/ Words with Friends, and an occasional game of the Jewel Blitz game (addictive!).

The buttons shown on the bottom get in the way when used in the portrait position.  Kindle books are best read in that position,  so you have to be very careful where you hold the device along the edges, or you will be back to the apps screen.  Also the edges are too pressure sensitive causing strange things to happen,  just when you don't want them to.  Now if you buy a tablet cover case,  you may be able to avoid some of these problems, depending on the case.  Sitting  upright in the landscape position (in tablet cover) with a stylus being used,  this unit works remarkably well.  But if you want to lie on the counch and read a Kindle book,  I would choose another unit.

So over the Thanksgiving weekend we bought this (with the $100 off from Costco) as it was on sale.  So far here are the differences we noticed:1) The ipad2 is more responsive when it comes to selecting things.  I shop alot at Kohls and it was horrible how I can't get anything sorted because I can't get it to register my touch.2) We can actually use this as a GPS (we tried it out, he ipad we have has only WIFI).  This is a plus because our GPS just broke and we were thinking of replacing it (and now we don't).3) I miss facetime (but supposedly there is other substitute for it which we have not tried).4) I use the ipad before with the abc app to sometimes catch up with shows I miss.  The abc app on this is lousy (it would stop working in the middle of it) and the quality of the picture is not so good.5) we don't think this supports the international keyboard (we really like to get the kids to practice writing Chinese words on the ipad which they don't really do but the functionality is there)6) there are apps that supposedly support microsoft documents like powerpoint and words.7) Both don't have flash player supportSo currently I'm using this to play games and check mails and web browsing.

The control buttons are located on the front of the tablet which means that you frequently inadvertently hit one and you go back or to the home page.  This happens most when using it as an ereader or while playing games.  Once you have done this a bunvh of times you do become careful how to hold the tablet.  The power and volume controls are inbedded in the side and I eventually will remember where they are and not keep turning the tablet over and around.The second issue is that it is not compatible with the adope flash reader so you cannot watch Amazon video content.  There are numerous companies that you can get movies from but I was considering Amazon prime.Tablets now are like vhs and beta back in the old days, eventually there will be dome consistency amoung the manufacturers.The picture is fabulous, it is easy to use and the keyboard is the best of any tablet I tried.  I like the 10.1 inch size even though it is bulky to carry, the benefits far outweigh the detriment.Added note:  If you need more storage it is far easier to add a micro sd card when you can catch them deeply discounted (many were 70-80 percent off for Black Friday, etc.)  For $23.00, I added 32gb of storage.  Had I purchased the model with the additional storage it was around 100.00 more.  The trick is to find the sale on the micro card.

I use it daily. However I will remark that if you only use it for streaming Netflix, the battery will drain faster and faster. I bought two and tested it out by playing Netflix movies until the battery drained to 25%. I did this experiment daily, recharging it every time and at first I had a 6 hour battery life....now it is down to 4.5 hours.If you really want a great PC tablet I recommend the Dell 8 Venue Pro. It is faster but the screen resolution for Netflix sucks and Samsung has a really great resolution and color with little buffering problems if any. It all depends on how you want to use the tablet. For Kindle reading, surfing the net and buying very neat android apps, mostly free on amazon, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. If you are only interested in surfing the net and emails, then the Dell PC tablet is faster.Lastly if you purchase this Samsung, go and buy the Amazon Basic case with handle. It fits perfectly and has a great side pocket for all of your toys.and gadgets. I love this case. Its is made of neophane, light weight and works great.Also buy the USB adapter. It is a USB Micro-8 to USB A 4-pin. This way you can hook up a flash drive or SD card reader and double or triple your storage. I downloaded all of my movies from DVD to two large SD cards and play movies when on the plane. I highly recommend this adapter. My favorite is one that Walmart sells...\"StarTech com. Model number UUSBOTGADAP. It costs around $4-5 bucks. I ended up buying 4 so I can use it for all of my tablets [Dell and Samsung]. If you order it from Walmart, they will ship to your closest store and shipping is free and you get it within days. Amazon sells their own adapters...just make sure you order a USB Micro-8 to USB A 4-pin. The good thing about StarTech is that is is very small and has no cord....but easier to lose...so buy a backup or two.  Some complaints is that the USB port is on the bottom of the tablet and you can not use a stand because the adapter is in the way. Turn over the tablet!

The tablet is incredibly snappy, switching between apps like a champ.  You would think that all of that processing power would come at a cost to battery life but that's not true.I had a Google Nexus 7 that I bought when they first came out.  Its a good little tablet but its a little small for reading magazines on.  The 10.1 screen of the Tab 3 is a much better form factor for reading magazines on (more legible screen).  I was also amazed at the incredible battery life that I got with the Tab 3 compared to the Nexus 7.  With the Nexus 7 I was charging the tablet almost daily.  With the Tab 3 I am able to go days if not a full week (depending on how I am using it).  With the Nexus 7 I was having a lot of issues with keeping it connected to my wireless N in the house.  It would stutter a lot while trying to watch video on.  I actually had to create a guest wireless account with it locked at wireless G speeds only for it to stay connected.  With the Tab 3 I was able to connect to the wireless N without any issues.  It even connects to the 5Ghz band without issues.

I'm a first time tablet user, but I'm very comfortable with technology. I've gone back and forth between ios and android, and am currently in a serious Apple phase (laptop, phone etc.). However, the iPad doesn't allow you to expand the storage and it doesn't have a USB port, so that I can easily transfer music and pics more quickly than over WiFi. My one complaint thus far is that it is very slow surfing compared to my Macbook Pro or even my iPhone running over the same WiFi. It's kind of frustrating, but it get's the job done. I'm taking this little baby to Europe in place of my laptop, so we'll see how it works across the pond. I think that if you're looking for something in a reasonable price range that is easily accessible and easy to learn, this is a good option. The size is also great as well. I was seriously torn between the 8\" and the 10.1\". The 10.1\" is closer to an iPad in size. Also, it's still small enough to through into a purse/bag. It can't fit in a pocket, but if you plan to use this for more than just reading a novel, you'll appreciate the larger size-still very light.  I'm enjoying it thus far.

They effectively turned my three year old (and working fine) iPad into a future brick. Over the past year or so, I've been moving over to Android - most recently with the addition of the fantastic Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone. I figured it was good timing to make the full switch over to Android and Samsung.The Galaxy Tab 3 has all of the features I really like on my phone. It's easy to use, and I love the expandable SD card slot on the device - makes it super easy to extend the device and move files around from my PC to phone to tablet. Since I already had a bunch of Google accounts, all of my information transferred to the tablet easily - just a few set up steps and I was ready to go.My biggest complaint is the placement of the power cord, which sits at the bottom of the device in its standard landscape mode. This makes it completely awkward to have the charger in while you're using it - in fact, I have to unplug the power cord (and plug it back in) when I flip open my case (Moko case). It's also awkward when you're sitting with it and trying to charge it at the same time.

My last tablet was an Asus Transformer Prime which I bought two and half years ago. Even today the Prime had specs to rival the majority of top tier tablets; quad core processor, plenty of ram and memory, an incredible screen, but it was so damn unstable. It would lag, freeze, WiFi was weak due to the aluminum backing, internet browsing was a chore, and eventually the keyboard became so frustrating and unusable. The camera wiring was shoddy and stopped working a year ago, and the screen finally gave out when I dropped it while it was in a case, in my bag, from a height of two feet or so. I decided I was done with ASUS tablets, and electronics in general from the less reputable companies.This Galaxy Tab 3 so far has been a dream to use. It's not really faster, and the screen is actually a lower resolution so it's a little less crisp, but I didn't need something much more powerful and I don't care if app icons look \"a little fuzzy\" as some people complain about. I just needed something from a reliable manufacturer that was stable and fluid. And so far I've gotten exactly that. Still a 10\" screen thats very bright with excellent picture and movie quality, a little smaller, much lighter, switching apps is smooth, it doesn't lag as much, the WiFi signal capability is stronger than my Droid RAZR, and the Samsung UI feels much more polished.Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this tablet. I considered the Galaxy Note 10.1 because it has more memory, 1.5-2GB I believe depending on the model, as opposed to 1GB the Tab 3, but it still runs very fast. I use it for browsing, games, and all my class textbooks, PDFs, and streamed lectures. It runs everything very well. I guess if you have use for the stylus or need the ability to run dual apps side by side, maybe doing a lot of spreadsheets, note taking, and business that requires complete fluidity, maybe go for the Note so you'll never be starved for extra memory to run fast. But the Tab 3 is an excellent tablet for the Value, and I got it for about half the price I paid for my Prime when it was initially released.", "Title": "Love it so far", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "Falaurie Bastien", "ReviewID": "R342JBP65KIRD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy with my purchase.

I left my laptop at home on my recent vacation and regretted the decision daily.I have had a problem in charging the tablet for about 2 weeks. It takes multiple connection attempts to finally see the unit taking a charge via the wall socket adapter (I have not had the problem when charging via the USB conected to my laptop). Once the charge indicator shows the battery is being charged, it usually takes about 10-15 minutes before the charging stops leaving the unit in a perpetually-undercharged condition. Multiple searches on Google haven't helped me find a solution, so it's possible this is a rare condition. I strongly suspect it's software related, although I have found other charging-related issues with the Tab 3 on the internet that were related to problems with the battery connections.", "Title": "Trouble in paradise", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "BlacklightHalo", "ReviewID": "R2RLECV7HH4I9J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this tablet is a big hit with me. I bought it after a two-year run with a Blackberry Playbook 7\" Tablet, and for the most part this is a much better experience. There are a lot of things which could (and should) be easily possible with tablets these days which I'm appalled to see that many of them don't do (reading common file formats, etc.) This tablet does most of those things as if it that were just \"how it's done,\" which is exactly what it should do.What I like:This tablet comes with removable storage capacity. Whereas more and more companies these days are realizing that people will buy more devices faster if they have to upgrade to the next-largest hard-drive every time they run out of space, it's refreshing to see a MicroSD card slot in a tablet. This is one of those things that, when a company doesn't do it, I think \"really? How can you possibly imagine you'll get away with that?\" Once again, though, here this is not an issue. It's also much more universally compatible than a lot of its competitors. For instance, I can pair my Bluetooth Speaker with it effortlessly, despite the fact that it was made by Skosche and not Samsung. It's agreeable and not finicky.Then there's the capabilities it gives you with photos. For me, the ability to crop and otherwise edit my photos in the same device that took them is a big deal, and this tablet offers many apps each with various useful options in how to do this. You can also disable location-based services. As a privacy-conscious person, I definitely approve of this, especially when most apps demand permission to view your location, even when they have no need of that information to perform their function. \"GPS\" is one of the options in the top-menu that you can shut-off completely with a single touch.Then there's the multiple desktops feature. This is one of the reasons I so love Linux OS. I'd like to be able to give each desktop a different wallpaper, but maybe this will be in a future update. Another thing I enjoy is the ability to use the file-browser of my computer to access and change the contents of the tablet's hard drive. I can just drag-and-drop files into folders, which is far and away better than a tablet which requires you to download its proprietary \"desktop manager\" or other corporate software to manage its contents and then be SOL when said software inexplicably malfunctions (I'm looking at you, Apple and RIM!)Also, speaking of the lack of corporate meddling, this tablet is a mostly DRM-free-zone. While unfortunately there's copy-protection on a lot of the Play Store media content (like eBooks,) if you tend to get your media from others sources (like downloading music from Amazon or ripping movies from DVDs you own) then you'll find yourself perfectly able to enjoy your own legal right to copy your own files across your own devices on your own terms, and access them on your own terms as well. This NEEDS to become a socio-economic norm, and I applaud any company who already does things this way.What I think could be better:The port at the bottom of this device for charging and syncing is TINY. Micro USB is a TERRIBLE choice for something that has to be plugged in and left to charge or sync as often as a tablet, because it really can't take much of a bump without being damaged and becoming unusable. Maybe they think this is somehow a more efficient use of space, or maybe this is more of that \"make it suck so people will have to pay for repairs and replacements more frequently\" phenomena I mentioned, but I would be stoked if they'd just put a regular-sized USB port on it, like they have on the other end of the cable. Smaller is NOT always better, and there's plenty of space on the bottom of this tablet for a standard USB port.Also, while this tablet's onscreen appearance is appealingly customizable, you can't change a few things that I'd really like to change. For instance, the drop-down menu that gives access to your WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc options is a really abrasive white-with-black-and-blue-font. The same is true of the options menu. This wouldn't be such a bone-of-contention with me if I could invert or even customize the color scheme, but apparently no one thought of this in designing Jelly-Bean. Unfortunately those colors are really harsh on my eyes, especially if I have to use the tablet at night (and I take night classes, so... yeah.) The least they could do here is create a \"night mode\" that inverts the colors to reduce eye-strain. I'd like to see this as an OS update in the near future.Also, this tablet will not communicate with a computer running Linux OS no matter what mode I set it to use. I guess most people don't (yet) use Linux, so this is likely not a problem for you. But considering that Android is *based* on Linux and has many of the features that Linux users enjoy, this should not be happening. I even have a smaller Android tablet (Archos 43) which does not have this problem. But sadly in the case of the Galaxy 3, \"Droid doesn't.\"Overall, this tablet is a huge improvement in my life and I'm very thankful to have it, despite its aforementioned shortcomings. It's not absolutely perfect by my standards, but it's at least several steps in the correct direction and makes the technological and business aspects of my life overall much easier.

It was this tablet that actually made me put down my iPad, which I never thought I could do!  The fact that many of the apps that I used frequently on my iPad where also available with the same or similar experience, made it easy for me to convert!!!  I also loved the fact that many of the book in the Play Store are less expensive!  Okay let's talk features!  This tablet is thin and light compared to my iPad 3, which seems so heavy now.  One of the best tech feature is the option to use a micro SD card slot for extra storage, and of course USB support!  This also means that the cables are much less expensive and I don't have to buy \"special attachments\" for every little thing that would cost me about $40!In addition, I love the fact that I can work on Word docs, PowerPoint Slides and excel spreadsheets and then save them to the hard drive or upload them to the Cloud (via Drive).  This is a great feature because I am always working on various documents while on the go!  I am a huge Google user so the setup is very easy and my experience is the same as if I were on a laptop.  I love the Smart Eyes features where the tablet goes to sleep when it can't detect your eyes looking at the screen.  I am still exploring new features everyday.  It took me a long time to figure out how to close the apps running in the background! LOL!Lastly, if you're like me, you still may need a keyboard to really take advantage of this tablet because the SWYPE method can only go so far during dictation!  I purchased the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard for this tablet and it's like a mini laptop!  The downside to that keyboard that I have learned is that is drains the battery very quickly!

In addition, the button is fairly sensitive so sometimes it would graze against my shirt and it would go back. My second gripe was that it's only a duo-core. That's not much of an issue in and of itself, but when you can get a quad core for cheaper it convinced me to exchange.

(I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \u20282. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\u20283. Google Nexus 10 tabletI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.After spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to WallyI liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.The mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.It was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.As far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.Though made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.Even though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the two Samsung units were only about $30 less.After considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry.", "Title": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 vs Nexus 10 vs ASUS Transformer T100TA", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Melissa R.", "ReviewID": "R17SUQWH8X2OWK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Was not aware that I could not watch movies from my Amazon Prime membership on this device.

The Galaxy tab 3 leaves much to be desired. Swiping, accessing applications, keyboard typing, accessing the Internet, home button, seem very lagging and slow. The back button has a very large touch area - a lot of times you accidentally hit it and it takes you out of your current app. Very annoying. The side bezel are too thin. When holding the tablet in landscape mode, since the bezels are too thin, your fingers constantly keep touching the surface, and while you are doing something, it just throws you off by switching to another screen. This is also very annoying. The 1280x800 resolution just does not cut it nowadays. Pictures and videos seem fuzzy and not sharp. The speakers sound are just too low and not clean and crisp.

We just got fed up and ended up connecting the laptop. Also, the adapter plug we bought from Radio Shack for the HDMI cable to the TV did not connect very well and we had to fiddle with it until we got a secure connection. That may have been the fault of the Radio Shack equipment however.  I also wish it had a flash.On top of this I am disappointed with its picture taking ability. I hit the \"take a picture\" icon and sometimes it does it right away, and other times it seems to be focusing in and out, in and out, and it takes about ten tries before it will actually take the picture. REALLY INFURIATING!. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but surely it shouldn't be that \"iffy\". I'll be phoning Samsung about it when I get back home.The most annoying thing about it is that the bezel around the bottom \"back\" and \"menu\" icons is way, way too sensitive (as noted by a CNET reviewer). If you grip the frame anywhere on the bottom it activates one or the other.  If it's not in a case of some kind you have to juggle it when in Portrait mode.  I think it must have been designed to be used in a case.Another thing I don't like is that it comes preloaded with a lot of apps that i don't need or want and I can't seem to get rid of them. You can uninstall apps you got from Google Play but not the preloaded Samsung apps, to the best of my knowledge. They take up valuable memory.One thing I anticipated using it for, and it was successful in doing, was playing back TV shows and movies downloaded on the laptop then transferred to the mini SD card using a mini card adapter. We bought an adapter for our headphones at Radio Shack and were able to plug two sets in at once so we could both watch while on the bus for 4 hours in Mexico. The Tab 3 worked well for that although I would have liked a little more volume. I will take a previous reviewers advice re the Marley buds.  Good picture though. It seemed to have good battery life too which worked in our favour. It does charge quite quickly and holds it for quite some time.I also find the layout for Hotmail confusing.

I have been an iOS user for many years now since no one was able to come out with a decent MP3 player except Apple. So, that being said, I do like Android and but I am prepared for being called Apple \"fanboy\" or any other names because I choose iOS over Android all because of functionality but I will be making iOS comparisons throughout the review.I bought this very light, very sleek tablet for my mother who is in desperate need of an upgrade from her extremely tiny Verizon netbook obviously built for Hobbits. I had it ship to me so that I could set it up for her and so that I could learn about it before handing it over and explaining everything to her. I have not used Android in a while and I explained to her that Samsung is a great company that comes out with great phones such as Galaxy S3 and S4, although I have never used these phones but have seen them in use.The first thing that I did when I was taken to the home screen was go right to the settings to change a few things as this was for my mother and I wanted to make it as easy and painless as possible as Android is a little more difficult than iOS, especially when it comes to app deletion which is easier on iOS  as all you have to do is hold the app down, click the red circle and voila! gone. not so much with Android. you have to go to settings, then to apps then click delete app. a little more to do, but not really that bad. The next thing I did was check out the apps and the functionality of the device. That's when I shook my head.Jelly Bean 4.2.2. Still very VERY leggy and choppy and still VERY delayed since when I first used Android back when it was in its infancy. Apps would take 3-5 seconds to open up. The screen is not as fluid as iOS as it takes several swipes to get it moving. It's as if you had multiple apps and programs and movies playing using up all the resources. Not so when it comes to me, as I always close all the apps after I use them and don't plan on using them again for a while.The apps are not clear and crisp, which I understand could be the developers not updating their apps, but when reading text or viewing apps and album covers you see blurry or just plain unreadable text and images of apps you wish to purchase, it makes one lose faith in Samsung who is supposed to be a great innovator of sharp images. Their TV's are phenomenal, but alas, their tablet falls way short when it comes to sharpness and functionality.I love playing with this tablet, but after using an iPad since its inception several years ago, even when the iPad 1 was super slow and heavy, I find Samsung's version a little tiresome as I have already seen all of its functionality in the iPad. I understand that Google and Apple have been butting heads and stealing from each other since they both came out with their mobile technology but when you see cookie cutter copycats of functions and features in other tablets you tend to get a little bored. But, you have to go with what works and what is popular.I love the live wallpapers on Android, but yes, it's a resource hog. I'm sure there are other functions I have to limit or turn off in order to get the 7-10 hour usage, but I am realistic. What are those features on there for if they want you to turn them off to get the full functionality out of it? Same goes for the iPad and iPhone and other brands. They give you features then tell you not to use them if you want the battery to give you many hours of usage. With the Galaxy Tab 3, however, when the battery tells you it's now at 93% after about 15 minutes and you have 3 and a half hours left of usage, there is something wrong. Even my nearly year old iPad 3 gives me more usage than a brand new Galaxy.I know this review sounds like I am bashing Android and praising iOS and downing Samsung and lifting up Apple, but I still think that this tablet has promise and I know it just came out and I am sure it can get better, but I have to say that a 400 dollar price tag is a bit too much. This tablet, in my opinion, is maybe worth about 300-325 dollars if that. Because it is slow, because of its minimal features. I feel the same way about the iPad. I have the 64gb version and I feel that 700 is way too much for this tablet too. I think it is worth maybe 400-450 if that. But, you are paying for the name, of course, so I understand that. If the Galaxy was made by Asus I would probably pay 299 for what it does.Another thing I didn't care for about the Galaxy, and I know this is an issue with Skype  is the video feature doesn't work. I can see myself but the other person cannot see me, even though I began a video call. I researched it and found others are having the same issues.That being said, I will play with the tablet a little longer and I am optimistic as I have only had it for a day. But if I was given the chance, and money, even though Apple is way too high priced for what you get, I would not buy this tablet again and I would buy my mother an iPad. For the sake of its ease of use, functionality, and hardly any delay in its applications or features.

Kincy \"Anyone\"", "ReviewID": "RJY75GANHSNX0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch tablet a couple of days ago.  I was adding it to a Lenovo W520 Thinkpad, X220 Thinkpad, Gen 1 iPad, home built desktop, and an iPhone 5.  I have been with the iPhone for 12 months coming from an Android HTC Sensation 4G that I had for 3 years, so am not totally unfamiliar with the Google OS for android devices.I also should preface this with the fact that I still am very actively at work and mostly use these devices for profitable work product.  My main work effort is keeping in contact with and being available to about 500 clients for advice when they need and want it, which results in needing to accurately keep up with 800 or so contacts.  I only say this so you understand that my primary need for the device was as a larger iPhone clone to keep in contact and read email and get client info right away when I need it and to replace my aging iPad Gen 1.My main source of client data and email is my Outlook 2010 although I also have a Hotmail account, GMail account, Yahoo account, and an Exchange account.  The proliferation of calendars, and contacts folders across multiple accounts and multiple devices is a nightmare and I have yet to find any cloud device that doesn't cause more problems in that management task than it solves.Unfortunately I must add the Galaxy Tab 3 to that list of failed devices.  The iPad Gen 1 although now ancient and the iPhone will with some trouble sync using iTunes with Microsoft Outlook. This is the main folder I use for my important contact data.Although it has been said by Google that you can use Google as an interface between your Microsoft and your Apple devices for contact management it is simply not true.  After nearly 12 concentrated hours of cleaning up and synching my multiple devices in to a clean concise Outlook.pst and Outlook.csv file, I was totally unable to get that file into the Samsung tablet although I had no problem importing it into Google as a comma delimited file.  I tried to import the Google contacts into the Samsung Tablet and although that works on any of the PCs or the Desktop through Google, I was unable to get the Google accounts showing on the Samsung tablet to show any of the 800 contacts at all.  Yet GMail would come onto the Tablet as would my other email.  It is important to also note that fact that the amount of email I get completely overwhelmed the Tablets email applications ability to show and organize it.I than tried Kies to download the Contacts, Calendar and Tasks.  Absolutely no go.  Given the number of accounts I have I need to pick the specific Main Outlook PST file to sync over to the Samsung with Kies.  Once you check the box for Selected Outlook folders, Kies will freeze up and not show the choices of folder to select for the download.  Several times after walking away from the tablet for over 30 minutes it would finally show the selection of the appropriate folder, but than would download about 4 iterations of each of the 800 contacts and 3200 contacts in a single contacts folder with only 800 discrete files is not what I would call successfulI would think this Samsung device is wonderful for folks that are not looking to spend Apple iPad money and want to mainly use the tablet for music, photos, and games and a small set of contacts and a few emails a day, but it certainly is not for someone that has a lot of data and emails they need to keep close track of.It has been reset and it going back to the store.WK", "Title": "Totally Worthless Device", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "sonny", "ReviewID": "R3GD6VM5R0Z43P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is great if you never had a tablet before.
