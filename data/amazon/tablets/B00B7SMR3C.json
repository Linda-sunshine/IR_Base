I just received my new g-tab 3 days ago and I'm very pleased with it. I was a little worried about buying it because it's cheaper than the zeepad and couldn't find any info on it so I expected a worse performing device but I was wrong! I own two zeepads for my kids and while they are about the same I have to say that the g-tab is a much better device. It lasts a lot longer on a charge. The kids have to keep charging the zeepads and they never last long when were away from the house. About 1-2 hours max for the zeepad and 2-4 hours for the g-tab. It also doesn't freeze up like the zeepads do like every 15 minutes. The kids are used to it though and I hear a whine every now and again when they are in the middle of a game and it locks up on them. Havent had this problem once with the g-tab! The screen also seems better with it. The wifi is faster too but the best part is the price. $10 cheaper than the zeepad!! Wish these were for sale earlier. I want to buy more but it says there's none available on here. I hope its in stock soon!", "Title": "Just like the Zeepad... except better!", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Maggie Godwin", "ReviewID": "R15KGBZ4JL9C3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little tablet is great!

I had funky software issues with more than one of them. I had already returned the device that wasn't working well plugged in for a replacement. I had software issues on 2 more of them (Angry Birds stopped working on one with just a black screen and the play store wouldn't connect on the other), so I decided to download the image from their website. That process is really easy and takes just a few minutes, but after applying the new .img to it, the g-sensor/tilt no longer worked (and the build date was older in the \"about\" settings.) An email to the manufacturer the other day wasn't immediately returned and I tried to call but it went to a cell phone voicemail mailbox. Ultimately I decided that in the long-term I'd be better off with something else from a mainstream manufacturer so I decided to spend the extra money on refurbished Nexus 7s instead.I dropped it a star in the review for the troubles but I won't give it just 1 star. This is still a good budget device if you're going to use it for a basic reader...but for $100 more you can get a refurbished quad core Nexus 7 with a way better screen, twice the memory, and 3x the battery life.Original Review:For the cost, these little tablets are great for kids. As others have stated, the build quality on these is actually pretty good for the most part. They do feel nice and solid, the touchscreen is responsive, and overall they work really well. I bought 4 of them so I've had quite a bit of time into getting them set up. They come with pretty much nothing but the play store loaded, which is great. It is most definitely nothing like my Transformer, but you shouldn't be expecting that now should you.A few issues:1) The touchscreen can be a little screwy if you have the power cable plugged in. I haven't always had good luck  with using the device plugged in, which can be a problem sometimes since battery life is only 3 hours.2) These don't charge via USB. If you do have it hooked to a computer, it will say it's charging, but it's not. If you plug it into a USB charger, it won't do anything. There's a separate power plug and power cable - plan on using it.3) The main issue I had with the devices was related to the external SD card. I bought a 32gb SD card for each device, which it recognized and I could access from the Android file manager, but third party apps (like plex) couldn't access the SD card. They would get 'access denied.' I was able to track this down to an issue with the platform.xml file in /system/etc/permissions. If you plan on apps writing to an SD card, you will need to root the device and modify this file as follows:The simple solution, if you're rooted, is as follows:1. Using a root-enabled file manager, navigate to /system/etc/permissions and make sure you have mounted the file system r/w.2. Edit platform.xml and find the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.3. Add an additional group definition for this permission...<group gid=\"media_rw\" >4. Save the changes to the file.5. Restart your tablet.(Source: xda-developers post 20869996)Before I did this process, I didn't even check if they were actually rooted. I see another review says they are...so if so, bonus! If not, you can root pretty easily. I'd suggest downloading Root Checker to check before doing this.(UPDATE: after a fresh software load from the image on their website, the device IS rooted. I'll leave this here for historical reasons! It's pretty much not necessary to do any of this)To root, you need to download the the following:* Android USB drivers from PDANet+* Root_with_Restore_by_Bin4ry_v25 (xda-developers thread 1886460)Without further ado, this is how I was able to do it:* Install PDANet+ to load the USB drivers.* Go into the settings -> {} Developer options of your tablet. Make sure USB debugging is enabled* Connect it via USB.* Extract Root_with_restore and run the batch file inside* Pick option 1, then option 1 againYour device will restart and you're good!Once rooted, I found it easiest to email myself the file, modify it on my computer, then just copy it back in from my SD card. I did have to change the permissions on the \"permissions\" folder as well as the file to get it to stick. I just made them 777. I used the \"Root File Manager\" app to do all that.Whew, all that, just so my kids could store their synced movies on the device for our spring break trip. Anyways, I digress...Just a final note. I, or Amazon, or anyone else but you take no responsibility if you screw this up or it jacks your device. For peace of mind, I have been able to (successfully) re-image two of these devices from the stock firmware downloadable from Matricom's webiste so there's always that option. I was able to successfully do this process 6 or 7 times.", "Title": "Great budget device", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "D. Hill", "ReviewID": "R295EPBA56HRMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a VERY reasonably priced Android tablet, with few MAJOR issues, but a few quirks you should be aware of.  I bought 2 of these, one for me to play with, and one for my 9yr old daughter.  Buying it for her instantly ended the requests for \"her own cellphone\", since all she really wanted was something to play games and access the app store.I don't want to discount the qualities of this table with \"you get what you pay for\", because in many ways it's a really incredible value.  BUT...the screen is great, because you get what you pay for.  You want a higher resolution or more responsive screen, you're going to pay at least $100 more.  The sound is great, you get what you pay for.  The A/C charger works, but you get what you pay for (relatively short cord, and it sometimes gets pretty warm to the touch).  I have had ZERO issues with Wi-Fi, it connects right away to our network and the speeds are adequate for streaming video from our home server, as well as apps.Battery life, as others have stated, is horrible.  If you play games or watch videos (which is a big part of tablet usage), it will suck the battery down.  The exact same thing happens on my MUCH MORE expensive Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, so you can't really blame the tablet.  In standby, or doing email and internet, it's not that bad.  Again, consider how LITTLE this thing costs, and keep that perspective.  But also keep in mind that video and graphic intensive apps will very quickly deplete the batter of any device.I tested it with MaxGo (the Cinemax streaming app), and playback was fine.  Sure, it got a little choppy sometimes, but it installed and played without a hitch, while many other users of that app had complaints about it not working with their device.  I used it with the PlayOn app, playing local and streamed content, and it worked with no problems on video and music.  We're on a wireless N network, with an 18Mb internet connection, we had no complaints or issues with the tablet in that regard.I had no problems at all with the devices recognizing our 16GB SDHC cards, and have had no issues using the application manager to load apps to the card, as opposed to internal memory.Also, I connected one of the tablets to the computer via the micro-USB port, and not only did it work without issue, it also appeared to be charging the device.  I've seen customer comments stating otherwise, but in our experience, this was not a problem.  Whether a USB cable-based A/C charger would work, I don't know, I haven't tried that.  But it did charge while computer-connected.Now, for the quirks.It appears that both of our tablets (and many others sold by the manufacturer) were formatted using the same android image.  Somehow, this corrupted any unique hardware identifier code in the devices, and there are several apps (especially games, like everything from Team Lava) that do not use username or email authentication, but rather tie an app to those unique device identifiers.  all of these tablets have the SAME identifier.So, if you load those apps, instead of your own unique game experience, you are transported into the existing game of someone from the company, because progress is not stored locally on the device, but rather on the app developer's servers.  I emailed the company about this a week ago, and have heard nothing in response.  So, they lose a star for customer service.  Also, the company website, as of this writing, contains no information about this device, other than that it exists, and directs you to amazon for all information pertaining to it.There are some games, newer and more graphic-intensive, that do not render correctly on this tablet.  Candy Crush Saga and Jurassic Park Builder, are examples.  So, you may have to do some trial and error testing to see if your desired game will look right or not.  Again, going back to my previous point, you get what you pay for!I've seen complaints about the screen (you get what you pay for!).  It has a narrow 'sweet spot' on the viewing angle.  If you get off-axis, text gets blurry and brightness drops way off.  But, if you keep that in mind and hold it accordingly, I think it makes a passable e-reader, webpage browser, email viewer, or whatever.  It would probably never work outdoors, but I think for some late night reading in bed when you didn't want to disturb anyone or turn on a light, it would work.It may sound like I have negative feelings toward this tablet, but seriously, it is an AMAZING value for what it is.  It's great for youngsters new to the mobile device world, as it gives them an entry point at a low price, so if it DOES get damaged (inevitably it probably will), you aren't out hundreds of dollars.  My daughter is very happy with her tablet, and I'm happy with mine.  It's incredible that something this inexpensive can do as much as it does.I'd recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive tablet, or even someone interested in learning more about Android, and rooting devices.  It's a nice platform (already open) for learning how Android works, and since it doesn't cost much, there's less risk involved.It is exactly what it claims to be, and it's very good for what it is.Obviously, if you compare it to a kindle, a nook, ipad, nexus, or whatever...it will come up lacking.  But, for this price, I think it is an excellent value, even with its quirks.", "Title": "It is what it is, and yet it's still pretty good", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "mike d", "ReviewID": "R2P86GOBWNCX87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, can not go wrong for internet browsing and email as a disposable road warrior.Assuming that it proves itself with durability.

I feel like I got more than what I paid for. The tablet started right up and found my wifi connection immediately without any issues. It is fast and it is very nice, from the graphics to the seemingly endless amount of things you can do with and to it. This tablet has a very decent amount of memory, more than my netbook, amazingly, so I am very pleased with it. The shipping was fairly fast, also.I ordered this tablet for my step-son's 6th birthday so that he can use it for learning games and the like, because I couldn't see spending over $100 on a leappad to be limited to only games of that brand that all cost an additional amount of money each time you would like to add another one. And though I bought it for my 6 year old and just received it today no less, I have fallen in love with it and plan to use it more than he does. I will buy one for myself soon, and probably for my hubby, too.

Contrary to other reviews, it does charge via the usb cord. At least the one I have does. I connected the usb cord to an AC adapter, plugged it into the wall and it began charging immediately. I don't know why others have said it doesn't charge with the usb. Maybe they were trying to charge it with the cord connected to a laptop?

I think my son downloaded too many games on it and probably fried the processor or something. Who knows.Update 09/26/2013:  The seller did not do anything for me. They never responded to me. I contacted Amazon and they referred me to Matricom's headquarters. Matricom customer service was helpful and they asked me to mail the tablet back to them. It did cost me $5.60 out of pocket to send in the tablet, but they replaced it with a brand new tablet. The new tablet has been working fine for now for a few weeks. I just monitor it more closely and I keep my son from downloading too many games from the playstore. This tablet only has 512mb of RAM so it does run slow. I increased my rating to 4 stars due to good customer service, and that it's not THAT bad of a tablet considering the price.BOTTOM LINE: This is NOT an IPAD replacement. This is NOT a SURFACE or a GALAXY TAB replacement. This is not even a KINDLE FIRE replacement. Please people, come on now! If you pay $65 for a tablet, expect it to work as such. In a world where a good pair of headphones costs $300 and a decent smartphone costs nearly $600, if you pay $65 for a tablet, you will not get a super fast super responsive tablet.

Im new to tablets, mine doesn't seem to lag, downloaded some antivirus, and memory clean up programs, have not had any problems, battery life only sucks when your doing enough to drain it, it will hold a charge for a few days, playing games while connected, while running 3/5 save screens, with the volume up, that stuff runs down your battery, but if you shut off the internet, close out of the save screens, etc, the battery life is a bit better, not a super battery , but decent.  definitely get headphones if you want good sound. i simply remember to keep my charge cable around if i plan on being on it for more then an hour.  as far as i can tell i like it better then a nook anyways.", "Title": "so far so good", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "Papaluc", "ReviewID": "R23KPCJLETZ4GI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received tab a week ago, I'm no computer expert by far and got quickly at ease with it and so did my wife!

This screen responds very well to standard finger swipes with the skin of the finger.No complaints there.The ONLY complaints I have are:- The battery seems to bleed out pretty quickly....but then again, considering the cost, that's probably not uncommon with this price-range of tablet.- The cord to the charger/power-brick is pretty short.  Since we sometimes have to use the power cord to keep it charged while using (if someone forgot to charge it, which my kids often do), then the extremely short power cord is kind of a pain....limiting you to be very close to an electrical outlet or use an extension cord.Other than that, we're very happy with this device.Even if it had costed much more, it works great and so far we've not had any issues.When you factor in the price!?!?

This tablet isn't it. The screen quality is very poor, and very shiny. It bothered my eyes to look at it, and looked dim, even on the brightest settings. However, when we got the tablet and turned it on and used it, it worked, and it worked well. For the whole day and a half that we had it before \"The Fall\". One small fall (onto carpet), and it came apart; the screen separated from the back and the motherboard. Nothing actually broke, and there are no cracks in the screen or on the tablet itself, but that short fall has rendered it completely useless. The screen is trashed; it's just squiggly lines on a white background. While we didn't expect super high quality from a $70 tablet, I certainly expected something better than what we got.

Everything works as it should and, it runs for over 3 hours, (so long as your display brightness is a  just under thirty percent, (plenty bright for indoor viewing.) It isn't an IPC or a high pixel density, (156+) res display (I'm guessing it has about 120ppi display) but, for the price, I had no complaints. It charges up pretty quick and, can also be charged via the micro USB port.It has a really good stand-by time, (I accidentally left it on, in standby, for over 3 days): I think it was into day four when, I picked it up to turn it on. It was at 1% but did complete the shutdown sequence when I immediately went to power it down. I had used it to watch a stored Stargate Atlantis episode so, it had been running for a good 45 minutes before being put into standby. The wi-fi automatically shuts down in stand by... something not all tablets do.The 2160 HD Player is a joke... It functions but, there is no HDMI out port and, the display is not, as I said before, an HD display so, you are not going to get any better viewing of an HD movie over standard definition by using it. I do like the OTG feature: I have a USB thumb drive, with a bunch of my recorded shows and movies on it. I can watch em all with no glitches.It comes with Google Play, (not someone's proprietary and pricey Android app store) preloaded and, Amazon App store can be downloaded and added through Google Play Store too. It doesn't have a lot of RAM but, as long as you aren't running a bunch of apps, that isn't much of a problem; (it does have DDR3 ram at least.) It can run Netflix, with it's 1.2 GHz single core processor and, it does have Flash video support, even though it is running Android 4.1.1 (Mine was already upgraded when I bought it.)In my opinion, this is one of the best values, if you are looking for a budget tablet that actually isn't buggy. It has a US warranty address too, to go with the one year warranty; good news to anyone who has bought cheap, (made in China and sold there.) Buying from sellers in China, you get a bum tablet and it will cost you much more than you thought to save, just to maybe get it fixed, (and do not send anything to China without paying $12 for delivery tracking -- no tracking = it doesn't arrive.)", "Title": "Good tablet for the budget concious.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "bobby fritz", "ReviewID": "RF04A78HDEXAR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good product for 50 bucks. just freezes and is a little slow other than that its an all right tablet", "Title": "you get what you get", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Korey", "ReviewID": "R2VB7TGETU4S2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I knew it wasnt going to be a high end device but I also expected it to have some basic functionality.
