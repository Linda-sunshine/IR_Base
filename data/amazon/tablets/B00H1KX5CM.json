When i received the item it was not what I had ordered. So I called customer support to get the unit exchanged. I was informed I could not exchange it due to it being sold by a third party.I went ahead and got a credit and sent it back. reorder the unit again. But was told by the customer agent I could get next day FREE shipping. GREAT!!!. Wrong, I was informed by another customer agent that certain conditions needed to be meet. I was not informed by the previous agent of the conditions.The entire experience left a sour taste. I will need to get full details in the future.", "Title": "Wrong item sent.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "ProductID": "B00H1KX5CM", "Features": "Samsung Original Leather Pouch Included in box - Part# SM-T3100ZWSXAR/SM-T3100ZWYXAR\nAndroid 4.2 Jelly Bean OS, 1.5GHz Dual-Core Processor\n16 GB Flash Memory, 1.5 GB RAM Memory - Store photos, videos, music, and more with up to 64GB of memory available through a microSD slot and 50GB of free Dropbox storage\nCamera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing\nPre-loaded with free content including Hulu Plus membership, Google Play credit and Boingo Wi-Fi Access", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HH0GxpHAL._SY300_.jpg", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 3,8-inch, White 16GB Wi-fi (Pouch Included)"}}
