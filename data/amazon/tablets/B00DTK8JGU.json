However, we contacted the supplier and were able to fix the problem. As far as the PROS for the device I would say obviously price was great, speed and responsiveness is ok some delay at time but not too bad, comes loaded with PlayStore so you are able to download the same apps you would have on your android phone and has a 2 cameras not the best pictures quality especially in low lighting but like I said my daughter is only six not a deal breaker. The cons would be the battery life drains rather fast and the screen is difficult to see, you have to find the right angle to reduce the glare.
