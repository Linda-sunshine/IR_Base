The reason that I chose a Kobo over the comparable Kindle or Nook, etc is because you can use multiple systems (such as Kindle for Android) as well as the Kobo system to get books.  This means that I can download from virtually any website or app!  As an ereader, I love that not only does it hold many, many, many books, it also plays games that you cannot get on your PC or online.  I can access the internet through WiFi networks, including my email, Facebook, Pinterest, Amazon, etc.  I can also watch videos on my Netflix, HuluPlus, Amazon InstantVideo, and any other such accounts that you access online.  (And since this Kobo runs the internet, there is no need to hook it up to your PC to download anything! That may seem like an obvious thing to some, but to someone like me who has never used an ereader or tablet before it is a good thing to know!  LOL) I also liked the organization system on this ereader/tablet...and you can add to the existing files to personalize your own Kobo.  As someone who loves everything filed in the right place, that was important to me.  After all, what is the use in downloading a book if you can't find it afterward?  So to sum my review up,this Kobo ereader/tablet is all I wanted and more.", "Title": "Love, love, love it!", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00H8VR9D0", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
