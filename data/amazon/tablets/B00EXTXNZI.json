It works quite nicely. I like the front & rear cameras. Comes in handy with Skype calls. :)The tablet seems to work fine with Minecraft, and other games. Video is good for watching your own vids, or youtube, ect.I also like the keyboard which uses USB, so no worrying about mating protocols.I get about 2 hours of use from a full charge when on fast mode, and a good bit more on normal.I used one of these for a theremin gig I did in New York recently. I had it attached to my theremin so I could call up the music accompaniment tracks I needed. She really worked a treat for the gig.

Opened it, everything worked right off of the bat.

They said they're sending me a replacement one.All in all, this is a great tablet. For the short time I had with it, I had a blast exploring the Android Jellybean 4.2 OS and customizing it to my liking, in most ways I cannot do on my apple device.

Now, the screen won't even show. I'm not overcharging the battery because this power cord has a lower output voltage than the one it came with. I'm taking away two stars for this. If I get it to work again, I'll bring my rating back to 4 stars, but for now, it's going to 2 stars.EDIT EDIT::Alright, I figured out the issue and I fixed it. Brought my rating back to 4 stars.
