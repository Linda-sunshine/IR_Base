{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Y. Z.", "ReviewID": "RDX49WUVHD3JT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As potent as the iPad and its App store are, and as fabulous as Android Tablets have become, I still could not pull the trigger on either one.I really, really, wanted a Windows 7/8 environment on a Tablet.Thankfully the wait is over, but are we getting everything we wanted with this one?Bottom line first:This Asus is by far the best value 10\" Windows Tablet in the market now and for sometime to come judging from the price tags of similarly equipped Win8 Tablets by Acer, Samsung, HP, DELL, Lenovo, MS and others.To find the Asus' page with details about this model, Google eee asus vivotab-smart featuresOr better yet: search 'ASUS Vivotab Smart Review Tablet-News' on YouTube for a true-to-life 28:07 minute video./-- See also Updates from 7/30 at the end of the review --/Hardware:The 10.1\" feels surprisingly light in your hands at 1.16lbs/580gr. By comparison, the iPad retina is ~3oz heavier at 652gr. The Plastic back is sturdy with no flex and feels good to the touch.The screen is bright and sharp. I found that I keep the brightness level at the very low end of the scale which also benefits battery life.When using it for plain Windows 7 tasks, plus Windows 8 games, browsing, Skype, emails etc. the battery was good for over 11 hours(!) at which time it was at 10%.Charging it back to 100% - while continuing to use it - took 4 hours.Asus provides a 3 foot long cable that charges the Tablet via the micro-USB port and plugs either into the provided wall adapter or other power sources (laptops/Desktops/Car USB chargers).Under the hood:Out of the 64GB it comes with, the recovery partition occupies about 8. Additional 20GB are taken by the OS + Asus but no bloatware which is really appreciated, thus leaving you with around 33G free. The micro-SD slot will support up to additional 64GB.The Tablet comes with 2GB RAM and that is the limit this architecture can support.The CPU/Graphics provide for a snappy and incredibly fluid experience and the screen is very accurate to the touch. It's a true joy to use. The tablet is also silent because the CPU does not require active cooling (i.e. a fan or ventilation slots). The combination of total silence and a lively usage experience is quite addictive.Note that the Atom Z2760 was developed with power conservation a priority, and the inevitable trade off is that it might not be able to play quickly or at high frame rate very demanding games, sophisticated graphics or video editing tasks. For those, you may need to stick with much more power hungry machines.'ASUS Live update' - When updating the BIOS refrain from disturbing the process. It may take 5 min to complete including a reboot. Drivers update worked quickly and without a hitch.Stability:After extensive daily use of the tablet for 4+ weeks, it has not crashed, nor hung even once!This is quite commendable considering this is a new OS on a newly designed architecture.Suggested Accessories:1. The box does not come with a micro-USB to USB, or micro-HDMI to HDMI adapters. Those will run you about 2 bucks. Make sure the USB adapter is of the OTG type. With that type of adapter, the Tablet recognized instantly a corded Keyboard, corded Mouse, wifi dongle for a Wireless Keyboard/Mouse, and a 32G flash drive. It did not manage to play music or video off of an external Samsung DVD however. Likely due to a limit on how much Amps the Tablet can output. That same external DVD plays fine with just one USB port when connected to my Acer HTPC. Various external HD drives will work too (see comments by other users). An externally powered HD worked right away as well.2. The charging USB cable that comes in the box is quite short at 3' and I use a much more practical 6' one. Again, not any cable will do. Mine was purchased elsewhere, but you can get one on Amazon for both Data and Charge, as mentioned by others in the comments thread.3. This slim folio provides great protection and proved very practical for everyday use  Blurex Slim Folio case for the ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C Windows 8 Tablet -- With Built in Sleep / Wake Function.4. The 'Smart' unfortunately does not come with a docking keyboard (the RT does, but the 'Smart' cannot dock into it).Instead of getting the Asus' Transleeve Keyboard, I ordered a corded mini-Keyboard/Touchpad that also incorporates 2 full size USB ports.The good news is that both USB ports of this Keyboard were recognized by the Tablet!  In spite of being a little smaller than the tablet - it is surprisingly convenient to type on (except maybe for people with large hands). The keyboard is extremely light at 10oz and provides ample feedback. The Touchpad is too sensitive though, which almost rendered it useless. To discipline it, I resorted to a no-Tech fix by applying scotch-tape on it and Voil\u00e0.A corded KBRD does not draw battery power like BlueTooth or WiFi ones do, nor does it require charging. Another benefit is being able to plug more than one USB device via the keyboard instead of messing around with the more delicate micro-USB port of the Tablet itself (a micro-USB to USB adapter is needed to connect the Keyboard of course.)

Win8 really shines in Touch environments, and before long you will find yourself swiping right and left, splitting the screen to share apps on your real estate, run Skype and Pandora in the background, open files and browse the Internet the perfect way that only true Browsers can, flip effortlessly between the desktop and Win8 Apps, update drivers on the fly, plug in USB devices, attach, send, share and manage any kind of digitally captured file, and what not.. You will have just one thing to say then: Hallelujah.I did miss the Start button on the Desktop application, but it was very easy to add. Win8 provides very generous customization options far beyond what I have already implemented. That's very nice to know.Windows 8 Apps Store:As of Early march 2013, with 31000 'English' Apps, the App store leaves a lot to be desired and is 'under construction'. The Built in search tool is rudimentary at best and is a hindrance to finding what you are looking for. I found some of my favorite games, News Apps, Utilities etc. to get a reasonable starting point, but it is still lacking in many areas.When you Search the Store using the Charms 'search', the Free version of some games would not show up, like 'Fruit Ninja' Lite. But they are very much there.Luckily, sites like Intel's AppUp.com or windows8apps.com are a great help in searching the store.Lastly, some aspects of the Tablet could have been better..-- I wish Asus offered a docking Keyboard/Touchpad and I think that Asus fell short with their TranSleeve contraption, which is the thin keyboard + origami-style cloth cover. The Cloth cover can be folded to support the Tablet from the back, but is useless should you want to hold the Tablet on your lap for example. Also, the Magnets that attach it to the Tablet are not sufficiently strong and both the keyboard and cloth cover can separate from the Tablet too easily, potentially causing it to slip.-- Although the sound quality is acceptable, with only one speaker on the back, stereo effects are, well.. non-existent.-- While charging the Tablet via the micro-USB port, the port cannot be used for anything else. At least the 10+ hours of battery life gives you ample opportunities to charge when the port is not in use.-- The GPS is not of the kind you have on your Cell. It's only usable when you have WiFi.The shortcomings however pale in comparison to what you are getting. This fantastic Productivity & Entertainment companion is a keeper for me.Update - 7/30/2013After 6 months of extensive daily use, this delightful tablet performed almost flawlessly.However..1. If you can wait a month or two, look for tablets that feature the new Haswell Intel CPU for a bit more performance, better graphics and even longer battery life.2. Do yourself a HUGE favor and only buy tablets that have a proper *docking* Keyboard w/Mousepad(!), saving yourselves the agony and frustration that come from relying on the virtual Keyboard or an external real one (not to mention that the virtual Keyboard covers almost 50% of the screen).", "Title": "Finally. A 10\" Tablet for the rest of us.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jeff James", "ReviewID": "R12E4NDDPOAXEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I would like to clarify that this a full blown x86 machine running full Windows 8 and it's only limited by it's hardware, it runs all legacy programs as well as Windows store apps, this is a PC that looks and feels like a tablet and for me that is excellent. Also this is not a Windows 8 review.Now that we got that out of the way, on to the review.This is a long review but I hope is useful if you're on the fence about this tablet or a Windows 8 tablet in general, I will point out some aspects I would've liked to know before I purchased this tablet as it may be helpful to you too, please read on.HARDWARE AND BUILD-----------------------------*You can read the full specs on the product description-It has almost the same footprint as an IPad and the weight is very comfortable without making it feel cheap, even with a case on this tablet weights less than 1.5 lbs. Actual weight is 1.3 lbs which is very nice. Mine came with a light creaking on the right side (landscape orientation) of the bezel but not a mayor issue-The Screen is superb for what it is(1366x768 IPS display), viewing angles are on par with an IPad and better than on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, crisp and clear images are produced and colors a very accurate, it also has adaptive brightness. Screen response is very fast and it has full Windows touch support and 5 point multi-touch support also  it has no active Wacom pen support-The Back panel has a rubbery feel to it makes it feel more expensive  and it does not attract fingerprints nor it scratches easily, also the camera decoration ring gives it an upscale look-Only one speaker is built in, not stereo speakers like advertised, this is  really my only hardware compliant, it is really quiet and puny, but I kind of expected that. Since it has a combo mic/headphone jack and Bluetooth 4.0 and the output trough the jack is very good getting audio out of this thing is no problem, you will need an adapter for separate microphone and headphone use, also I've found that the Intel sound driver has a weird way of recognizing when you plug in something and it sometimes kills the audio completely and you have to restart the tablet, this appears to be more of a bug than problems with the actual hardware,-The battery is non removable and is superb for a full Windows 8 machine, I've managed to get about 9 hours out of a charge using Bluetooth, WiFi and running several apps-The back camera is very good, it takes full 8 megapixel stills and records 1080p videos, front camera has a wide lens though is off centered, it looks weird but it makes sense for video calling-NFC and GPS are supported, you may share websites and contact cards with most NFC enabled devices but keep in mind that file transfers are restricted between Windows 8 products only (Includes RT and Windows Phone 8), this is a \"security feature\" in Windows 8 (Dam you Microsoft!)-The wireless antenna is very good but it will not connect to ad-hoc networks(like the ones created by some smartphones) and creating a WiFi hotspot is not supported,  these are \"security features\" in Windows 8 (Dam you again Microsoft!), you can install a third party app for WiFi hotspots creation but is not working for me yet-Bluetooth audio and remote control are supported as well as Dial Up Networking via Bluetooth and Nokia Suite in my case (solves my ad-hoc problem), audio streams with no problems, as well as the internet connection via DUN, fast enough-Charging requires at least 1.5 amps output from your power supply (if not using the supplied one) for a slow charge, don't expect it will charge off from your regular USB port on your computer these put out 0.5 amps at most, by the way the USB to Micro-USB cable for charging that is included is very short (like 3 ft.), you can use an equal longer cable-Haven't tried out the Micro-USB OTG feature and the Micro-HDMI port yet,I will be updating this review when I get some adapters, the Micro-SDXC port supports up to a theoretical 2 TB of storage, mine is 64 GB no issuesOverall very good hardware, build and finish is well executed and materials feel more expensive.PERFORMANCE/STABILITY-----------------------------This tablet flies on Windows 8 it opens apps and desktop programs(depending on the program) very fast is responsive and it handles multitasking quite well, stability is not an issue, had one freeze up during a Windows update but it resumed quickly, the Modern UI feels perfect for this hardware spec, the desktop side will depend on what you are running.This tablet has a Dual-Core Intel Atom z2760 @ 1.8 GHz and 2 GB of Ram @ 800 MHz, an integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator with a minimum of 64 MB and a maximum of 725 MB of shared memory and Direct x 9.3 installed and an on-board Intel STT Audio Device (WDM) with an eMMC 64 GB (~58 GB formatted) HDD.Windows Experience Index (Windows 8 32-Bit)Processor: 3.4Memory: 4.7Graphics: 3.7Gaming Graphics: 3.2Primary Hard Disk: 5.8That is good for the following(some examples):-All Windows Store Apps-MS Office and many document suites-High quality Video/Audio playback and streaming (YouTube Full HD, Netflix, Hulu, Spotify Premium, Sony Music Unlimited, Full HD video files and looseless audio formats)-Light Audio/Video and Photo Editing (Very light)-Some older games(Age of Empires 3, World of Warcraft on lowest settings, Fallout, Emulators topping on Gamecube/PS2-like graphics)-Some CAD programs and Audio creation programs (MathCAD, AutoCAD, Amplitube or Guitar Rig)-Some programming and SQL programs (MS SQL Server, MS Access, NetBeans,Flash Builder,etc)Basically anything that is not too CPU or Graphic intensiveHaven't tried virtualization yet(OracleVM for example), Windows 8 reports it's not supported by the processor but it may be configurable I'm not sure, also you can install Bluestacks or WindowsAdroid if you like to install some Android apps and since it's a x86 machine there's a possibility to put Mac OS X or Ubuntu on this thing.Overall very good performance for every day computing, as well as some leg room for big programs, very pleased.INCLUDED SOFTWARE AND ACCESSORIES------------------------------------------It includes the bare-bone accessories, only the charger cable, power supply and a cleaning cloth are included, as well as manuals and warranty info.Asus choose to include as little bloatware as possible, this is good, they just included their LiveUpdate, WebStorage, MS Office trial install and some windows modern apps, also they included the restore partition which you can back-up to an external USB drive and delete after if you want to get those 8 GB backOverall pasable software an accessory bundle, software wise is good since it doesn't rob me of my precious space, but accessory wise they should have included a Micro-USB OTG adapter and perhaps a cloth sleeve for travel. Also I would suggest getting a Bluetooth keyboard and a mouse since it makes things better on the desktop mode, in fact the more things you can use connecting Bluetooth or WiFi the better since the Micro-USB port doesn't seem to put out too much power and carrying around a USB hub (aside from the fact that the tablet probably is not going to be able to power your devices or even the hub itself) defeats the purpose of portability.CONCLUSION----------------------It starts at $499.99 for 64 GB (mine costed $487.99) and that gives you most of the power of a regular PC plus expandable storage in an tablet package, by the way speaking of tablets both the IPad 4 and the Nexus 10 are the same price and offer better displays and arguably better ease of use, minus less storage and no real PC capabilities. For me those tablets don't fit my needs like this one does because it has Windows.By no means is this tablet a \"anything-killer\", each tablet fits different needs and does it in a different fashion, so this is rather a completely different beast, a new genre of tablets, this tablet is a great start to getting your Windows 8 groove on, highly recommended great product.Look for options and do the research  to know if a certain tablet fits your needs and then go from there, for me it's finally what I was looking for in tablet, a portable full blown computer.", "Title": "Thin and Light! Very Smart!", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Deified Texan", "ReviewID": "RWHQN0KYH1EE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely a life changing device for me. I have to give up my office with the arrival of a baby boy. I fretted about this as I love my study but I really like my desktop computer in the study.My wise wife suggested I use one of our existing notebooks instead --- a no go for me. If I am sitting at a desk then I don't want to be on a laptop conversely for mobile use I am not a fan of notebooks due to the weight and battery life.I went to the Microsoft Store after watch all the microsoft commercials. I was hesitant as I had previously updated my desktop home computer to Windows 8 and what a hassle as I had to learn something new and different. I really liked the Windows Surface at the MS Store though --- Windows 8 was truly made for a tablet but the Surface ran Windows RT and if I lose my desktop then I would not be able to use my Windows programs (Quicken, etc)with the Surface. The Microsoft Rep told me that the Surface Pro was on the way but would weigh 2lbs and have a short battery life. No thanks.I came home and did some research and found the Asus Vivotab Smart which magically ran full Windows 8 on an Intel Atom processor. I was again hesitant as I had a netbook with an Atom processor years ago and it was slow. But the reviews were great on the Asus Vivotab Smart. So I bought it along with the cover and keyboard.Game charger. Its super fast and seamless. Plays movies without a hitch. The system is as fast as my eyes can watch the screen and fingers can swipe. Windows 8 is weird on a desktop but is by far the best tablet OS going. I liked my Ipad and wifes Andriod phone but they were toys to a certain extent. This has all the same features except that Windows 8 is more intuitive as a tablet than the Ipad and Android. Plus I can run my beloved Quicken and Microsoft Office, etc.I won't miss my desktop computer and office (save that is where I watched football).Pluses: - 9 hrs of battery life (I can confirm this) - Windows 8 is the ultimate tablet OS (use your thumbs) - weighs ~1.25lbs --- light - get the cover and keyboard --- the are a must, the keyboard is normal sized and the cover is a kickstand also - Screen is super clear and fresh --- viewing angles are great - Windows Metro/modern is great and it took getting this tablet for make me figure that out - Full Windows although I only find myself use quicken, office for the traditional windows programs - Take the dive and sign up for the integrated Microsoft experience: outlook.com email and use skydrive cloud for you storage which is free. I resisted this at first but once I switched over to outlook.com IMAP email and the cloud for \"my documents\" --- I realized I was stupid for waiting so long. - Thus Windows 8, outlook.com and skydrive synchs all my computers and tablets seamlessly with zero work. So with this tablet synched my email, music, documents, pictures, etc when I turned on the tablet for the first time and logged in with my email. - Kills complexity in my life. Now my computers, notebooks and this tablet are on the same synchronized platform even my background picture and passwords are the same. So I am going to sell my Ipad (never liked Itunes) and my wifes Andriod phone is on chopping block.Minuses: - The App store is still developing which is a bit of a hassle. Netflix and audible.com, fitbit are there but my wife wants the facebook app, pinterest (wife's request), skyward and a few others. - Apparently computer writers/reporters are fanboys of Apple and Google which will be a disservice as their readers will stay with those platforms instead of switching to Windows 8 tablets thus the App store may be slow to reach a critical mass of users. - Microsoft made a mistake with the Surface. Its beautiful but RT is limited compared to Windows they should have taken the Asus approach with full Windows 8 on a Intel Atom. This tablet is lighter, has the same battery life and all the windows goodies. - at $499 its more expensive than Androids although beats the pants off Apples considering you full Windows 8 - Does not come with Office installedGet this tablet.", "Title": "Great Tablet --- Now I can get rid of my Desktop computer!", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "rloonia", "ReviewID": "R37E8T00B6OMPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Battery LifeDisplay SizeProcessorNFCMicro HDMIMicro USBWeight (580 Grams)Full windows 8Build quality64 Gb emmcCons:Speaker volume could have been higher, but its still acceptable based on the compact form factor.Full USB port would have been better but not a deal breakerI initially got an Acer Iconia W510 and was fed up of the constant crashing/driver issues with the device and returned it.1. Build QualityChecked this tab in while surfing for windows 8 tablets and i liked its build quality and features that are mentioned in pro's list here (Acer tablet had a lot of flex on the back plastic cover). As expected the tab feels really sturdy with no signs of flex no matter how you hold it.2. Battery LifeThe battery life of tablet is great, i can go through full day (approx. 9 hrs of usage) without any problems.My use involves web surfing, videos, music, games etc (I use this for entertainment mostly)3. PerformanceIntel Atom serves for most needs, dont expect Heavy lifting programs like adobe photoshop to run very smooth but other than that for daily needs it works well even while multi tasking. I ususally have multiple apps open and switch between them constantly, the experience goes without a hitch. You can have multiple browsers/tabs open and it would work great, the 2GB RAM complements well with the atom processor and does not show any signs of slowdown in day to day use of Office, Videos, Music, Web Browsing, reading, Games from Windows store etc and also since this is intel powered, you get all the goodies of pugins to browser in desktop mode.4. StabilityThe first thing you should do when getting this tablet is update it, Asus Live is a good client to get updates related to drivers and you would see many windows updates which are very critical stabilty and power updates, these updates also include updates to make the microsoft store work better. Once you get up to date, there are no stability/driver issues and the tablet works well, Ive been using this for around a week and i did not see any crash or any driver issue. Its very stable and works really well.Hope this review was helpful for people thinking of purchasing this tablet. I definitely recommend this product.Thanks", "Title": "A Stable and Affordable Windows 8 Tablet", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jason T Nash", "ReviewID": "R2MDLB3BCG9P69", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like the hardware of the ME400. The 10.1 inch size feels a lot better than those larger 11.6 inch Atom tablets. The tablet is thin and has a nice soft touch back and rounded edges. The buttons seem to be in good locations too.What I don't like about the hardware, I wish the seam between the glossy plastic front bezel and the soft touch plastic back didn't meet on the edge of the tablet where my fingers rest. The seam is a bit rough in some places.ASUS claims there are two speakers and that SonicMaster audio provides richer basses and the best audio experience. Well this marketing spew couldn't be further from the truth. The tablet has one speaker vent (maybe there are two very tiny speakers side by side under it), there is no \"bass\" at all, and the volume is pretty weak. Hearing dialog is quite difficult. You'll definitely need to use headphones if you want to watch movies, TV, or podcasts on this tablet.But the audio wasn't too important (this seems to be a problem with many tablets unfortunately) and the rough seam doesn't bother me much, so overall I'm quite happy with the hardware.Where the real problems are though is with the software. You can't download drivers from ASUS's website. Instead they include an ASUS Live Update tool to get the drivers, this is the only way to get the drivers. This tool worked for me the first couple days I had the tablet, then it stopped working. Now I just get \"cannot connect to server\" when I try to launch it, then it just closes. This seems to be a common problem from what I've read on tablet forums too. Nobody seems to have a fix for this. I did a Refresh of Windows 8 on my tablet and unfortunately the problem remained.I contacted ASUS for help on this issue. The first ASUS rep I talked to went to look for an answer and 15 minutes later hung up on me without ever getting back. I contacted them again and the next guy told me he has no fix for this problem He can't provide me with the installation file to re-install ASUS Live Update and told me I just have to wait until the application is released on the website, which of course he could not tell me when that would be.The tablet sometimes will just freeze up and not respond at all. I'll have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to force shut it down and reboot. This has happened about 4 or 5 times in the almost two weeks I've had it. So not quite a daily occurrence, but happening more often than I like. I don't think it's a hardware issue, just one of those things with immature drivers.I imagine this tablet will get a bit better once ASUS get's it's act together will driver support. They've been quite terrible with it so far between this and their TF810 Atom tablet too. But I decided to suffer with ASUS because the hardware seems nice and the price was nice at $500.", "Title": "Nice hardware, terrible support and drivers.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Santosh Geddamuri Sr. \"Happysan\"", "ReviewID": "R1DH4VD5X33HW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in market for last 1+ year to own a tablet. Initially i bought ipad retina and returned it as it is too big and bulky for my taste. Later bought kindle fire and galaxy but didnt like the interface and waited for ipad mini. Once ipad mini came , i was no more intrested in it. Now i was looking for windows 8 tablet. But didnt like th RT version as it is very limited and no scope of expansion. Then i found VIVOTAB Smart.Its a great tablet with almost every thing i was looking in talet.Key features.Lighter then ipad. Though while holding the weight is not very significant but still its 30 grams around lighter.Cheap: This tablet is much cheaper then other windows 8 tablets.But the quality is very good.On screen Keyboard: Ipad has keyboard which layout cannot be changed. I have to reach from one corner to other while typing.Didnt like that so wanted a smaller tablet. But this tablet at very same size has multiple options for keyboard layout. Very easily split the keyboard into 2 on either ends and can be operated with 2 hands very easily.Slim design/video out. Tablet is very slim for what it is. It has both RT and full windows 8 desktop. Just hook it up to LCD tv via mini hdmi and you have big screen.So the scope of using as a full windows 8 tablet is better then Just RT or ipad.Memory. Can be expanded with SD card. While on trip add sd card full of movies and you can use it as entertaining device on go.Battery life: Too early to comment on but it will have better battery life then other hungry processores like Core I5 or I7.Also no heat issues.Camera: Camera is definitly better then other tablets. The images looks crisp and clear.Speaker: Could be better but as space is limited,one can live with it.Screen: it is beautiful ,not retina screen. But it is not bothering.Overall a nice tablet for cheap price. Low end processor gives better battery life and reduces the cost.So i prefered this over durface pro etc.", "Title": "Tab and PC in one", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "C. Tung \"Crazy scientist\"", "ReviewID": "R2NY5X79MR4FA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a good reason this product is out of stock on Amazon at the moment: it's a great tablet with terrific value.  Being a big fan of the original Microsoft Surface RT, this Clover Trail (Intel Atom) tablet does perform so much better than the current generation ARM processor based devices.  Everything runs faster, and it doesn't sacrifice the battery life much to achieve this performance.This tablet runs full Windows 8, which means nearly all traditional Windows Desktop applications run on this.  I haven't tried to install too many yet, but I find it cool to be able to have a desktop Skype running at the same time as the formerly Metro one, perhaps with different Skype accounts signed in.  Keep in mind that this is a powerful tablet instead of a convertible Ultrabook, I think the features on Desktop is pretty cool.  Desktop Skydrive also runs well, although I wasn't 100% sure I want to download all files from Skydrive at the first place.This is my third Windows 8/RT device, and I have to say it really grows on me, as a lot of the settings come automatically with a sign in.I don't know whole lot about how Intel achieves the power consumption with the new Atom, but my observation is that it takes longer for a desktop program to install, but when it runs it runs mostly smoothly without major lags.  One example I have is Office 2013.  I think it actually took longer for it to install on this new tablet than an old Core2Duo laptop, but when it runs there is no big difference, everything is smooth.  It worth to note that the most complained Windows RT apps all run a lot faster on this.  Some still not perfectly smooth, but not too far from it either.  The whole experience is pretty amazing.While Microsoft Surface Pro with 64gb Memory has only like 20GB of free memory for usage, after installing a number of apps, desktop programs, Office 2013, and downloading several GB of files from Skydrive, I still have 24.8 GB free.  I don't quite understand why but I'm happy with it.I don't want to write too much about Windows 8 here.  Basically with the touchscreen, it works very well on a tablet.Somewhere I read that some people had issues with updating software.  I ran ASUS's LiveUpdate before Windows Update, and it went fine.  ASUS's update sometimes seems not doing anything, but it was running so just wait.The 10.1\" ISP screen is fairly nice, all touch gestures work perfectly and smoothly.  Sometimes I wish the screen is a little bigger, but to be honest it's not too cramp to operate on most things.  It might be just my illusion, but sometimes I feel the touch screen is made of plastic instead of glass (according to ASUS, it's made of Corning Fit Glass, whatever it is).  Not that it matters much as long as it doesn't get scratched easily (which I don't see any in the short time under my ownership), just an observation.  If there is one thing I'm not very satisfied with, that is the Windows key at the bottom of the screen, which is a bit less sensitive than ideal, that sometimes it requires a longer or two taps to register.The front facing camera is far from top quality, but for say Skype video chat it's fine.  One thing to note that if you get the TranSleeve, there is an angle that you can use the tablet upside down, and in that configuration your front camera will send out upside down images.  The back side camera is not too bad, although I honestly don't know what's the main purpose of that, since I think a camera on a phone is much more important than on a tablet.The speaker(s) built in on the tablet are not the best, doesn't quite give you the feeling of surround sound, as other reviewers have noted.  The stereo jack is decent.  Relatively low background noise, but the sound itself is not whole lot to talk about either.The build quality of the tablet is very good.  Things are tight, thin and light.  Not much to complain.  There are reviews complaining about it gets warm.  It does, but far from anything which might make you uncomfortable.  In my opinion it's really only just warm, and I don't have much tolerance on things getting hot.I don't know how much they save by having only one USB OTG port, which also serves as the power charging port.  It does have an extra, independent Micro HDMI port.I got a Micro HDMI to VGA, a Micro HDMI to HDMI, and USB OTG to USB adapters.  The USB port works great, as I connected it with my USB hub both mouse and a webcam got connected fine.  Both VGA and HDMI adapters worked, but honestly I felt it's abusing this little tablet to try stream HD video from Amazon Instant Video.  It didn't run too well and I don't think I'll do that in the future.  I'm not sure it's the CPU, GPU, or the internet connection, it just didn't go well.ASUS TranSleeve and Keyboard Touchpad for VivoTab Smart don't work as well as the kickstand and Type/Touch cover with Surfaces, but they do work.

For everyone one thing MS got right they seemed to have messed up three other things badly.  With that said this isn't a review on the OS as Asus can't be held responsible for what Microsoft did with Win8.

I set it up to recharge over night and when I woke up the screen wouldn't react to any gesture.  I currently have a locked screen that I can't swipe to unlock to even try and perform a system restore.  After a bit of research online I've tried to 'hard reset' it through various combinations of holding down power buttons and volume controls to no avail.

When I called into customer service they had me do a \"Hard Reboot\" which resets the unit back to the factory defaults. This was annoying to say the least as all the apps I had installed were erased. What is worse is that the hard reboot did not fix the problem, the sound continued to cut out randomly requiring a restart to restore the system sound.This was the just the beginning of problems. At this point (less than 2 and 1/2 months from the purchase date) the touch screen has begun to malfunction. The unit behaves as if the touchscreen is being touched even when it just sits there being undisturbed by anyone. This makes it very hard to navigate as the unit continues to behave that way as I try to use it. Apps will randomly launch, websites will randomly be navigated to (and away from) letters will randomly by typed, etc...Finally, the touchscreen keyboard has begun to malfunction. There are time the 'a' key and the 'w' key just won't work. They won't work in any app. If you happen to have any of the failing characters in your password, you are up a creek.I have spend hours on the phone with Asus' lackluster customer service. They had me send in the unit for repair - which they will ask you to do at your own expense unless you complain hard enough. I followed the repair process through to the end and when I got the unit back I opened up anticipating that it was repaired.It wasn't.Nothing was fixed.Nothing at all.The same problem that led me to send it for repair were noticeable from the very first time I fired it up after getting it back from their \"repair\" facility.I should have known that this was likely as the Better Business Bureau has given Asus a failing rating (an F on a scale of A+ to F) and has a consumer alert against this company. Apparently I am not the only one who sends Asus products off for repair only to receive them back just as broken. According to the BBB:\"We have identified a pattern of complaints concerning service issues. Complaints processed by BBB claim that 1) products sent to the company for repairs are still not working properly when returned to the consumer.\"After all that expense, I anticipate having a very expensive paperweight.BEWARE!!!You might be one of the lucky consumers who have no problem with the product, but if you do have a problem, don't count on Asus standing behind their product or honoring their warranty.To this day Asus refuses to send me a suitable replacement or refund my investment.", "Title": "Buyer Beware", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "R.

I will briefly go over each and the say what I like so far about the Vivotab Smart.iPad:  Everyone talks about the big advantage with iOS being the app store.  I honestly don't see it.  I don't need 42 different apps that make fart noises or 54 that make it look like I am drinking a beer.  If they have the basic ones that allow me to get things done I am happy (Facebook, Pinterest, Weather, etc).  I think iOS's big advantage is the simplicity.  System updates are simple, app installation is simple, no detailed firewall settings etc to worry about.  Once you know a few basic gestures you can get around easily.  It is also \"pretty\".  Itunes is fairly intuitive although I found it did have a learning curve when I first learned it.  The disadvantage is that simplicity combined with Apples controlling nature really limits what you can do.  File management, forget it, all your pictures can only have one file level deep.  Playing different video files, not a chance, you have to convert first.  Printing from it, what a pain if possible at all.  Flash, nope, Mr. Jobs said no from the very beginning. Also, maybe it is just the first generation but I have alot of stability issues.  Every time I go to Facebook in any browsers it crashes after clicking around a few times.Android:  A great alternative.  Some file management and much more customizable than iOS.  More freedom to install apps that Apple would not approve.  The downside I see with them is most apps are not optimized for a tablet and I have yet to find a browser I really like.  Some are ok but non seem to hold up to Safari. Not quite as \"easy\" as Apple to update the system.Windows 8 (not RT): Five days in I am really enjoying Windows 8.  Websites look just like they do on my PC.  Flash works on the desktop if I need it and everything loads quickly.  Plus if I have any problems I can go to the desktop and run any browser I want.  I easily mapped to my homegroup and can transfer files from my main PC and set up the printer.  The apps are limited but I found 90% of the ones I want and if they don't, chances are good I don't need it since I have a real browser. No more paying for a hulu subscription just for the privilege of watching it on an iPad.As for the actual Vivotab Smart hardware, I have only used this tablet and played around with the Surface RT at the Microsoft store so I don't have alot to compare it to but I have been very happy with it.  It is the best price out there for a Atom tablet with 64GB of space right now.  As others mentioned, the system files took up about 30GB so be prepared.  I am ordering a 64GB Micro SD card to store all my media and just using the HD for apps.  I installed office and it seems to run plenty quick on the Atom processor.  This tablet is not going to run anything intense but if you are not a video editor or heavy gamer it should work just fine.  I only have two complaints.  First, Asus Live update is not working for me.  Keeps saying \"Can not connect to server\"  The second issue is a audio driver issue.  Every few hours I had the audio go out on me and had to restart to get it back.  I am sure if the Asus live update was working it would have downloaded a new driver but I could not get it to work.  I looked up in device manager what kind of audio card it was and found another driver on the net and so far it works great. Still, Asus should have the live update working.

I started really trying to cut down on the weight and decided I needed a replacement for the MacBook. It's an awesome computer, but too heavy. My requirements for a replacement were something lightweight and able to run MS Office well. Eventually I found the Asus VivoTab Smart. The reason I chose this over some of the other Windows 8 tablets is because the reviews were positive, it was affordable, and it has a clever keyboard cover-case-thing (sold separately.) This thing can quite literally be a tablet or a laptop. Will it ever be the best at either? No. That's obvious, but it performs as both fairly well which is a good compromise. It weighs about as much an iPad, maybe a negligible difference. It is comfortable to hold. I actually prefer holding this over the iPad because the slick aluminum backing on the iPad is like butter. It is fast enough to run Office, which is good for me. I haven't noticed a single hiccup yet.So, I guess the summary would be:If you want the best tablet experience, go with an iPad or the Android device of your choosing. Windows 8 isn't quite able to compete with the app style interface of either of those yet.If you want a laptop, well there are plenty of better ones out there.If you want a device that can function as a tablet or a laptop, seriously consider this device.

I had bought this Asus Vivotab Smart on May 29th and received it with fast shipping on June 3rd. When I got it, it work prefect I had no troubles with it as I am use to a Windows 8 system because have a laptop that has Windows 8 on it. I decided to purchase this Vivotab because I wanted some on the go instead of carrying around my laptop every I go. At first this product was perfect and I was happy because I was able to take my work on the go and access all my documents that's on my laptop on the Asus vivotab. I never dropped or abused my tablet in anyway what so ever, I treated this tablet and any other tablet I had used in the pass like it was my baby. On July 4th I used my tablet in the am, there was nothing wrong with it, I plugged it in to charge, between 5 to 10mins after I had used my tablet, I heard a loud popping sound coming from the table where I had my tablet at charging, I wondered what that nose was so I went over to my tablet opened the case and found that the screen was cracked and the plastic siding where the power button is was separated. I was upset and confused at first because I didn't know why this had happened. Since it was a holiday I didn't think anybody was opened so I waited until the next day to contact the seller and Asus about this issue. I was told by the Seller that I had to contact Asus to see if they can fix it and if I wasn't satisfied with the results from Asus which was no help because they are saying if I want them to repair the screen I would have to pay for the repairs which I didn't see why I should pay for any repairs do to this happening on its own which would make it a design flaw. So I contacted the Seller back telling them the issue again and asking them to either replace the product with a new one or refund my money back, The seller said the are not able to replace or refund my money do to the fact that the 30day warranty is up, wow the warranty was up by 1day when this happened. I am waiting back on the manager of the company where I got this Vivotab Smart from to see if they can possibly make an expectation, but I am not holding my breathe, I ignored all the complaints and bad reviews because I thought I would get lucky and get one the was fine or that the other people was just hating on Asus products because they simply didn't like them. Don't ignore the bad report about Asus, there are actually true, I have researched this problem and found that other Asus products including this Asus Vivotab Smart screen spontaneously cracks. Asus denies that this product and other product has this design flaw and refuses to fix it with out a charge, they simply like to call their consumers liars and blame and charge them for the repairs for a damaged screen. I explained numerous time to them and the seller what happened, this is why companies loses business because the like to deny claims and blame the customer..

This may improve in the future, but I have a limited return window and I am not willing to \"wait-n'-see\" if ASUS gets the issues fixed.  This is my first ASUS product, and I can say I am not impressed with the company.  In fact, after the 'top-notch' support I received from ASUS, I don't think I'll buy another ASUS product.The tablet was nice for the first couple of days while I was helping my father (77) learn to use it. I bought it for him as a surprise gift and he was so excited - there was no special occasion, it was a 'just-because' gift.Windows 8 Modern UI was fairly simple for him to pick up, and in short time he was able to send/receive email, browse the web, and open his Word documents after I added an Office 2010 license.After a couple of days he brings his new tablet to me with a problem. It wouldn't read the new microSD card I placed in it.  Turns out the card was bricked - no machine would even see the card.  No problem, I keep all of his stuff backed up pretty well, so I'll send that card back and get a replacement. In the meantime, I gave him a loaner card that I had been using for a couple of months in one of my other devices.The next day he brings his tablet back to me with a new problem. He says the battery was a little over half charged last time he put it down, but it wouldn't wake from sleep. After futzing around with the tablet a bit, since I could see a device share on the network I determined it was coming out of sleep, but the screen wasn't turning on. I decided the only thing to do at this point was a hard power-down and reboot. This can't be good for the device.Later that afternoon he has another problem. He applied an MS update that required a reboot. Unfortunately the tablet stalled on the rebooting screen.  I explained the processor, while great for every day tasks he would use the tablet for, was pretty much the slowest (current) x86 cpu available and it may take a bit longer for things like shutdowns to process.  He brought the tablet to me, still stuck on the reboot screen.  Another hard power down and reboot. I don't like doing that.Two days later, no microSD card access.  Same story - this one bricked too.  That makes one Kingston 64 GB card and one SanDisk 32 GB card that no longer work in any machine.  I have one more card - a second SanDisk 32 GB card that was in my phone for a few months.  I reformat that card, transfer his files back to it, and place it in his tablet.Same day - tablet fails to properly come out of sleep again. Shows up on the network, screen just won't turn on. Hard shutdown and reboot.The next day, Monday, his replacement microSD card is delivered. He brings his tablet over so I can transfer everything and get his replacement 64 GB card back in his new toy.  Except when I try to wake the device to 'safely remove' my card, it won't properly come out of sleep. Once I finally get it back up and running, I check for additional MS updates, then run the ASUSupdate. Says new version is available, but continually fails to install. Nice.  Never did get past that point.I tell him I need to factory reset the device and start over.  Maybe that will clear up the issues.  After taking all that time, updating everything again, a reboot hangs.  I waited about 15 minutes and it just stayed on the reboot screen.  Hard shut down and reboot.  ASUSupdate continues to fail again. Later, the device fails to properly come out of sleep ... shocker! Hard shut down and reboot.  See a pattern?These problems continue for another week and a half.  I need to do something more drastic ...Live chat with ASUS support was great!  I explain everything that has been happening and write that I have done a full 'device restore' (factory reset) but the problems persist.  His advice is to perform a device restore and he ends the chat session.  \"Did that really just happen\"?  Awesome!After some research I found a forum post with a several folks complaining about the same issues.  I decided at that point I should probably return the tablet and get him an Android tablet that has been around for a bit longer. That decision sucked.  Not that there were any hassles or anything like that. No, it was the look of disappointment on my father's face when I told him what I think needed to be done.That killed me.  With a pitiful look on his face he said, \"I'll trust your decision. Do what you think is best.\"  I will probably get him a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  My sister has one and last time I talked to her she really seemed to like it. I hope he likes that as much as the VivoTab and I hope he's able to figure out Android as fast as Win8.Anyhow, I took the ASUS tech's advice and performed another device restore, only this time I didn't set the tablet back up.  I boxed it up and set up an RMA with Amazon.  Such a pity.  This little tablet has so much potential, and it is entirely possible ASUS may fix the issues. I'm just not willing to wait and possibly have my father stuck with a device that never gets needed support.UPS is scheduled to pick it up later today - Mar 7, 2013-----Update Mar 9, 20135 stars for Amazon's return policy.

These I all bought from Amazon.My only real functional complaint after about a months worth of use, is that the tablet won't always wake up when I open the case like it's supposed to.  I don't know if this is a firmware issue or a Windows 8 issue.  I've played with the Windows 8 power settings and they seem to be setup right.  I've checked the firmware (bios) and there are no accessible power options.  If anybody has this working I'd appreciate you letting me know.  It seems to work if I lay the tablet down for a few minutes but if it's been sitting awhile (haven't tested just how long) it will not wake up.  Takes a long press on the power button to wake it up.  Have to be careful not to press for too long or the tablet will reboot which is also annoying.I think it's a great tablet that will only get better as updates come out and the apps improve.3/1/13 additional comments - I forgot to mention that I was able to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro and then add Windows Media Center.

Not the greatest of demonstrations but you know what you are getting into with the Atom but the restart was under 25 seconds.Hardware notes:It doesn't charge when you plug in the micro USB cable into another PC's USB port and it doesn't show up as an external drive or anything.  That would have been cool but I didn't expect it.  Not having a standard USB port is a big miss.  The front facing camera is very grainy.  The back camera is clear but I am not one of the people that takes pictures with a 10 inch device.  The Windows key for the new Start menu responds way too slow.  I think that is an Asus issue vs. a Microsoft one.  I swipe the left side for the Start menu because that is faster.  The speakers are pretty good.  There is a micro HDMI on the side that outputs at 1366x768.  The micro HDMI cable had a hard time staying in there because both the cable and port are small.  Speaking of the screen resolution it is low.  A large virtual keyboard, small screen, and a low resolution is not a good mix.  There is a light sensor on there - it will drive you crazy and make you think something is broken so just disable it and you will revert back to normal.  Trust me when I say you will revert back to normal.  I bought the TranSleeve Keyboard but never used it.  I gave it an honest effort as a tablet only.  I didn't want to make it bulkier or the battery to last a shorter time.Tablets like the Vivotab are really more a companion device, this is NOT suppose to be a full replacement for your desktop or laptop.  Do not compare it to something that has an i7, 16GB of Ram, 2GB video card.  Don't even put in on the list with them.  If you compare devices in the $500 range, it'll be hard to find something better.  The VivoTab is cheaper than the iPad and Lenono Thinkpad 2.  If the Thinkpad 2 and Vivotab were next to each other at the same price, I would have pick the Thinkpad 2.One may argue Windows 8 is not good but in tablet form, it works really well.  I really like it.  Windows 8 on desktops is a different story and that negativity is not towards this product.  If you lower you expectations and not compare the Vivotab to something high end, you'll love this tablet.  If price isn't an option, you don't want this.  Get the Lenovo Helix or Razer Edge.Small update on 3/24/13: I am still happy with this tablet but the ASUS notification center keeps coming up with the same to updates.  No matter how many times I install the bios update, it keeps telling me to do the updates.  I believe that is more of an issue with ASUS and not Microsoft.Another update on 4/4/13:  Asus sent another update where the notification problem is no longer there. Good job Asus!  I got the Razer Edge Pro and that is really big with no GPS or rear facing camera.  If I didn't get the Vivotab 1st, I would be singing praises for the Razer Edge Pro but I give credit to where credit is due.  Asus did a really good job and Vivotab is my measuring stick for tablets.  I used the Vivotab every day I got it and for the Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, Hotmail, news feeds, usage I had for it, it was great.  I never expected it to play game but it handled low end/casual gaming fine too (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja).  The GPS was something I thought I would never use and it lasting 8 hours was great.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an iPad or in the tablet market.  I unfortunately never tested anything Bluetooth related.

I've bought various other Asus products over the last decade or two. No more.I bought an Asus router (yeah, I know, this is a tablet review, but bear with me). It would disconnect frequently. Per their request, I RMA'ed it. They sat on the unit for 3 weeks after they received it. Nothing happened until a service rep followed up directly with their repair warehouse. I got it back, it's worked well ever since. Okay, one mistake, no problem. All's forgiven. I moved on.I buy this tablet two months ago. It worked okay for a week. It developed a problem where you hit the power button, the screen would turn off for 2 seconds, come on for a second, and then turn off. When turning the screen on from sleep, the unit would sometimes power up the screen for a second, then immediately go back to sleep. The problem was sporradic but grew increasingly more frequent until the screen would no longer power up. RMA #1 - the screen powered up. The problem with off-on-off behavior still happened. RMA #2 - they replace the LCD screen and \"fix it.\" I get it back, the problem still happens with no change in frequency. It's like they didn't even test it to see if they fixed it. They just tried something, powered the screen on once, and hoped it would work. They want me to send it back in for RMA #3 and won't offer me any assurance of a proper fix nor even swallow the piece of junk and send me a new one. I have to hope their repair warehouse people somehow learned to do their job and repair it or decide they can't fix it and send me a new one. No guarantees and my warranty time is ticking away. Of two whole months since buying this thing, it's been in my possession for about 8-9 days (it seemed to perform well despite screen issues in that time). Plenty of apologies, no results, and no complimentary items/discounts/vounchers to make up for awful service. They \"graciously\" picked up my shipping costs on the second round and are doing so for the third as well. Whoa, talk about generous!The moral of the story: Asus will not simply replace your unit if you buy one that is defective. You're at their mercy to get the repair right, which my experience suggests is unlikely. Their customer support is completely impotent and will only tell you to send it in.

The touch screen is very responsive.  The cameras work well, and the rear camera has a flash, which is nice if I ever use it.  It is nice and light and very thin.Now for the user experience.  The Windows 8 experience is much better on a tablet compared to a desktop.  Even then, it wasn't entirely intuitive.  Fortunately the tablet comes with a quick start guide.  It is definitely worth spending 5-10 minutes reading and practicing that.  Once I got the gestures and nuances down, I quite like it.  The live tiles are great, with updated headlines, weather etc.  It makes the Android interface, with it's static icons look boring.  It is a bit hard to figure out how to arrange and \"snap\" the tiles to the right place.  The Windows 8 app store is a bit bare, but there are some decent apps with looking.  But the best feature is that it can run any Windows program.  So for example, there is not a Spotify app yet, but I can run the desktop program as a substitute.  I installed Microsoft office and it runs great.The first couple days out of the box, there were loads of updates for drivers and software patches.  The tablet crashed two or three times during the first day or so.  Since then, with all the updates, it has been rock solid.The machine runs very smoothly also.  I heard reports that it could be \"laggy\" in desktop mode, but I have not found it to be so at all.  Of course, I have only run simple programs like web browsers, Word and Excel.  But they run fine and switching between them is very fast.  The best part of having full windows on a tablet is that I can hook up a wireless keyboard, mouse, and monitor and use it for basic computing tasks, just like a full-size computer.The user experience isn't quite as refined as Android in some aspects.  For example, when listing to streaming music, the tablet isn't smart enough to keep the internet connection live after it goes to \"sleep\".  I need to see if there is a power management setting to change.  Also, Android is smart enough to shut off the music if I turn off my bluetooth headphones.  This is not, and switches the music to the internal speaker.The battery life is very impressive.  I used it moderately for 48 hours without charging it, and it still had 40% left!

But where the iPad shines in games and media, it falls flat in giving a true internet experience and it has no real good way of navigating file systems. I have been patiently waiting for a true Windows experience in a tablet at an affordable price and I think the Asus VivoTab Smart finally delivers it.Out of the box the tablet is beautiful. The back is plastic but it feels high quality and has no flex. I powered it on and went through setup. I knew that there would be updates so I went to the Windows update and let it do its thing.I don't know if I am just impatient or what, but I thought it took an inordinate amount of time to get going. The tablet was sluggish for the first 48 hours of its life. Additionally, my wife and I have windows phones and are happy Google calendar and contact users which seemed to work well. These services are no longer supported with applications that cannot do \"two step authentication\" with Google's servers-which the built in mail client cannot. Further to that the WiFi kept dropping its connection. It was very, very disappointing. After all the reviews I had read recommending this tablet I was having buyers remorse.Well, after 48 hours the tablet still wouldn't speed up and I felt it was connected to the WiFi issue because it seemed slowest during network activity. I flexed some Google fu and found that other people were having the same problems. After reading some solutions I went to the control panel from the desktop, opened device manager then network devices and found the network device. I opens the properties window, went to the advanced tab and scrolled to bandwidth. I selected 11b/g 20/40. I hit okay and exited. WiFi problems fixed. Tablet now runs like a dream. No dropouts since fix...granted its only been a day but considering it dropped every five minutes before I count this a success. As an advisement, this solution works for my network setup, It won't necessarily work for yours.As far as the Google calendar/contacts issue, Google let's you create a special password for programs don't work with its new authentication but I was unable to get it going. It would always throw me an error. My solution was to let my windows live accounts access my Google account information and essentially merge the data. Now all my information is accessible through my windows account. This works for my wife and I but it may not be ideal for those outside of the windows ecosystem.After fixing these issues I love this device. It is zippy with the internet. The file explorer is very useful and does its thing very well. The gesture unlock is a pretty cool feature. It types pretty well...I'm typing the review on it now.

It seems odd to me that they would have skimped on this when the rest of the device seems so solid.Overall a very good tablet for a reasonable price.******* Update:After a few more days of use and a number of reboots for configuration changes, the tablet suddenly blue screened on me.  I can usually work through most Windows issues, but in this case it was an error in the boot configuration being corrupt.  On a desktop or laptop I could likely resolve this but there are limited options with the tablet.  Since I'm going to replace the tablet because of the SD port anyhow, I'm not putting anymore effort in to it.  Hoping this is an isolated issue, but I have to admit it has me a little unsettled.", "Title": "Very good value with a couple surprising cut corners", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "rengem88", "ReviewID": "R1FRCUW15XGEW9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I sold my Asus Infinity to get this because after 6 months I realized that the limitations I was experiencing on Android were too much.  I was really excited to get a tablet with full windows 8.  I ordered the white from another website.  I was trying to get the matching white keyboard and sleeve but apparently they have been discontinued.  So annoying.  Why make the white tablet but not the matching accessories?  I wound up buying the black keyboard set. So that's one con.  Can't match it.  I was absolutely thrilled when the tablet arrived.  I really like the look and feel of Windows 8 tiles.  The tablet was very intuitive setting up, fast, bright, clear, sleek.  I like the white, but I wish when they make a white tablet, that the front frame could also be white.  No biggy.  I don't mind the desktop mode.  I do not find it cumbersome, small or slow as others have mentioned.Here are the problems I have had in the 4 days I've had this.  Sometimes the screen will freeze out of nowhere and there's nothing you can do but force it shut.  I wanted to send a photo from my phone to the tablet.  Want to talk about a nightmare!?  I made sure bluetooth was on. My cell is always discoverable.  I went into the bluetooth settings on the tablet and checked the box to allow other devices to see my tablet.  When trying to pair, the progress bar would start to show the pairing of the 2 but would disappear immediately.  It would show my added phone as offline even though it was on and discoverable.  I could send a file to my phone but when i I tried to send to the tablet it would not send.  I tried my laptop, said service not available.  Tried another phone.  File not sent.  Called support.  They told me to refresh my pc.  My tablet crashed while on the phone with support and they said, whoops, can't telly you why that happened.  but refreshed my pc, didn't work.  Called again.  Told me to update my drivers.  Didn't need it, had the latest.  Called again, they told me to reinstall windows.  Did that and it didn't work.  Next day, refreshed my pc tablet again.  Noticed the link in bluetooth settings that says send or receive file.  The receive file box just explains that you might get an automatic message when someone tries to send you a bluetooth file and you will have to accept it.  I had left that open once before when trying to receive thinking maybe it had to be open.  Finally it worked.  You have to manually open that box up when receiving a file. There is not automatic message.  You can't be in another window or app when receiving a file.  That box has got to be open and in front of you. Seems so complicated and archaic.  A lot of guess work.  Why couldn't Asus have created an alert as well?  None of the support people at Asus ever even mentioned having to open up a receive a file window prior to receiving a file.  Oh an my tablet crashed a second time the second day of working out the bluetooth issue.  When pairing my devices this time, I noticed that the progress bar took several long minutes to complete the process, unlike the first 100 attempts! I understand these things can happen and there are always bugs and issues.  I am not having anymore problems.  You get a great bang for your buck with this tablet.  it also feels good quality as well as the keyboard.  Overall I am pleased and would only have chosen the surface over this but I couldn't justify spending twice as much for the surface pro, but i do love their kickstand and keyboards!

Snyder", "ReviewID": "R5OIQQQKO8YBN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new Asus ME400c is a pretty good windows 8 tablet for the same price as an iPAD.  I almost didn't buy this because Asus marketing and promotion is so terrible I couldn't find any mention of it on their website(s).  Even though it is labeled as the Vivotab, it is actually the Vivotab Smart.  There is no mention of this model number on Asus's website.  Considering its great price point, Asus really droppped the ball by not having better marketing and promotion.The actual tablet is of decent build quality and feels nice to hold.  I really like the widescreen format (as opposed to the more squarish iPad I own).  It has a nice quality rear camera, with an adequate front camera for skype or other video chat options.The powersaving CPU is quite a bit sluggish, as it often takes 5-10 seconds for a new app to load in.  Considering the tablet's great battery life and small size (no fans), its a trade-off I will live with.It also has some compatibility problems.  I am finding some apps don't work well with a touch screen.  Web browser controls such as flash movie players can have click and drag controls that don't function with a touchpad.  Because of this, I often rely on Win8's barren app store.  This puts a big limit on the programs I can use.  A Keyboard/touchpad cover would be a good workaround, but I couldn't find one (It was originally supposed to be bundled with one, but good luck finding it for purchase.)  You can use any small bluetooth keyboard or mouse, but you will have to lug it around.The Speakers on this tablet are not good.  It lacks stereo speakers, and the quality is not good.  Headphones are recommended for watching movies and pretty much a necessity for listening to music.As for the actual OS, it is hit and miss for me.  It crashes too much for my liking.  Programs sometimes simply refuse to start.  I have had to reboot my win8 tablet more in one week than I have had to do in 6 months with my Ipad.  Using the OS when it does work seems to be 50% fun and 50% frustration.  Sometimes Microsoft just refuses to do things in an intuitive way.  Perhaps if they hadn't bothered with the idiotic Windows RT OS and just focused on Win8 things would be a bit better.If you feel you really want a windows 8 tablet, this is pretty good.  The underpowered processor has enough of an upside to recommend this over some of the Core i5 versions (price, physical size, noise, heat being just a few reasons)  The lack of a keyboard cover clearly hurts this device, although it is supposedly avaliable somewhere to buy.  I couldn't find one.The Asus vivotab smart ME400C provides a price competitive windows 8 tablet solution.  When looked at this way, it is a big success.  The device's overall quality and performance doesn't compare to say, an ipad at the same price though.

In any case, it is nice to have both environments at times, since there are too many applications that don't exist in a tablet version.We haven't had any major issues with it except that Bluetooth tends to shut off, and then the tablet needs to be rebooted to get it working again. This is remedied by adjusting the power saving settings for Bluetooth, but one shouldn't have to do that - hopefully Asus will come out with a fix. Asus has also sent numerous OTA updates via LiveUpdate, so when one receives numerous BIOS updates, it does not give one the warm fuzzies about the technical maturity of the product.All that being said, I think it represents a good value for the money.

Asus VivoTab Smart Tablet is a reasonable product, but not a great one.On the positive side, it has good features such as lightweight, reasonable touch screen, long battery life, running Window programs, and a USB port.

On some Window programs, the scroll function does not work at all.  iPad has a far better touch screen design.* Google Chrome does not work (cannot open).  My Window 8 notebooks runs Chrome well.

Popov", "ReviewID": "R5YBEAKP6LZ7W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Aside from what has already been written on features and performance, I'll add a few important pieces of information that I did not see in he other reviews here.First, the color of the screen is not neutral. I am sensitive to good and true to life colors and the VivoTab's are on the warm side. This means than white is not white but yellowish. You might not notice unless you put it side by side with a calibrated monitor or even an iPad but it will be very apparent once you do. Grey are not neutral grey, blacks are not true black, white is not pure. Download something like the free Monitor Calibration Wizard utility and you can make things look acceptable and correct most colors to a relatively neutral look. Another poster used a calibration tool (\"Spider\") and advised simply lowering the greens by 19 points via the built-in Intel graphics utility that you can access through the tablet's settings. To me this did not work nearly as well as the calibration wizard software, which addresses all colors and creates a color profile for you.Second, the edges are sharp and do cut-in uncomfortably after some use lying back on a couch and holding the tablet for watching a movie for instance.The casing is not that sturdy compared to iPad and there are some creaky areas, although nothing terrible.The rear camera gives a soft image on screen but when the photo is taken, it is of OK quality. The default setting for this camera is way low resolution and you may want to bump it up if you have the use for it.Do spend the time to learn the basic gestures of Windows 8! The first time I had Windows 8 on a non touch screen laptop I found it terrible. I actually quite like it on the touch screen. Most things are one or few gestures away. Close an app - no problem and no need for alt-F4 or clicking on a \"x\" - just swipe down from the top edge of the screen.The charger is slower than the one on the iPad 3 but does charge the tablet fully overnight.I paired a generic full size Bluetooth keyboard with a built-in trackpad fine and after using the mouse a bit, found that touch and gestures are A LOT easier to do just about anything that does not require pin-point accuracy (for which the touch pad is not good anyway)UPDATE 3/16/2013I lowered my rating to 3 stars, because of the following:- the tablet freezes on me at least a couple of times a day when doing routine tasks such as vhecking email or being on youtube.- at startup, when waking it up from sleep, often the screen goes blank and the only way out is to restart it- YouTube video playback is sometimes choppy (even if it is already buffered), and sometimes smooth (on the same clip), so performance is inconsistent.On the plus side, I saw the optional keyboard for the Vivo SmartTab - it is beautiful and scarry thin. Did not try it but it looks very nice.Not sure how much of this is due to Windows and how much due to the ASUS hardware... I have installed all patches and running the latest firmware. I'm returning the tablet but not sure what to get... if the Lenovo Tablet 2 was $100 cheaper I'd get that in a heartbeat, but as it is, at nearly $700 with tax it is too expensive for what it is... might as well get a \"real\" computer with Core i5 processor and a touch screen for that much money...", "Title": "Good value, some issues", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "Abdullah", "ReviewID": "RR6OP94A8RCKN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this tablet and after two months had cracks on digitizer which make the touch not functional.I spent more than 2 months communicating Asus to fix my issue and no one has enough knowledge to answer me.

I called service expecting nothing good and a short phone call later they gave me all the info to send it in to service in TX.  It took a total of three weeks to get it back and I am happy to report that I am typing this update on my Asus tablet that has been working great for the last two weeks.While there are some functionality issues with Windows 8, my tablet has been working better since it has been returned from service.  They have not told me the problem, nor do I really care because I am very happy with this tablet as its performance has been wonderful.  It has did freeze up once that required a restart that made me hold my breath, but it has not returned... it used to happen 5X per day.  Whatever service did, it was necessary and worked as I am very happy with this tablet.Previous review:You get what you pay for.... I bought this for work as I needed Microsoft outlook.

It flickered for a minute, wouldn't turn on for about an hour, came on for five seconds and now won't turn on again.  Yes, the battery is charged and even plugged in.

The tablet itself is not heavy, although after about an hour of holding it, it can seem heavy. I like that I can use the gestures and charms which my 3 year old has figured out rather than buttons or having to go back to the home screen. I found it saves some time albeit a few seconds, but time none the less. Although I don't use the desktop much, there have been times where I have found it to be useful to have something familiar. The cameras aren't great, but they are capable of capturing an image and video chatting (I use Skype). This isn't my main camera, and it is a bit akward and cumbersome taking a photo with a tablet so this wasn't a must have for me. If you are one the fence about what tablet to buy and want apps galore; this is not the tablet for you. As a matter of fact stay away from all Windows 8 tablets because there aren't nearly as many apps as there are in Google's and Apple's app stores, but the app's that it has are more than capable of allowing you to do what you need with this tablet.To wrap this up, the tablet is light, the screen is nice, the gestures and charms are simple, the Windows store lacks apps, the desktop is refreshing, and all in all this is a great tablet for the price.", "Title": "Doesn't deserve the negative criticism", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3H86JARAOYAFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had the IPad, had the Android tablet, finally happy as I can go from PC to Tablet mode, so much more one can do like installing programs, etc. Love it", "Title": "Amazing Little Win 8 tablet", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "A.NG", "ReviewID": "R1MJR8I3P7NUWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Con: Limited variety of (free) apps, tablet froze (even from light usage) frequently which force me to force shut down, the system reboot itself a few times because it suddenly encounter a problem...

Every time I wanted to shut down the PC I got a blue screen and an error message.  The only way to shut down the computer was to \u201csuspend it\u201d.  During the past 4 months the problems have been increasing.  After a while none of the programs of Microsoft Office would not work.  Every time I tried to open one program of the office package the computer would try to validate the software with Microsoft.  The ASUS computer was so unstable that every software package felt they were in different computers every time I started a given program.With all these problems I called the Technical Service of ASUS.  I called the technical Service of Asus in Spain because I moved to Spain.  They asked to send them the Serial Number, the Guarantee and the invoice, which I did.  I sent al the requested documents and after two weeks of going back and forth they told me that they will not fix my computer because the invoice of Amazon US did not have my Tax or ID number on it. I tried to explain to them that Amazon US makes the invoices that way but no luck!!What a disaster of Service!!  I cannot recommend to anyone that they purchase any equipment from ASUS.  If you have a problems, you are in your own, no help from the manufacturer. NO HELP AT ALL.We also had a problem with an ASUS tablet ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C-C1-BK.  The tablet once a week would all of a sudden go to a blue screen and you would lose everything and have to start all over again.  We called the technical people at ASUS in Spain and they again, did not want to take care of the tablet.  They told us in addition that it was our fault because we upgraded from windows 8 to windows 8.1, and we were supposed to use always the original software from the manufacturer.

I've had Asus android tablets and this unit is very similar in size and form as their 10\" Android tablets. As for performance, it basically matches a dual core android tablet in almost all aspects except that it seems to handle video playback not as efficiently. I actually think that Win 8.1 (free upgrade from the 8.0 the unit ships with) works quite well with a touchscreen tablet and I've not experienced any locks or freezes I've experienced with android tablets (maybe just lucky). Having only one micro usb port is a hassle as you need a OTC adaptor cable to pair it with external drives and which is not possible while recharging the unit. The screen clarity is more than adequate and certainly bright enough. The unit used to change it's brightness setting by itself while in use, which kind of bugged me, but that was corrected by changing the display settings (not really intuitive - requires some knowledge of the OS to figure this out). The other thing that disappoints me is the lack of a satisfactory app for GPS and offline maps. I had an 2010 version of Microsoft Streets and Trips I loaded but it won't recognize the internal GPS (how stupid is that - MS software not working in their own environment).

I did install a powerful piece of software that requires a good bit of memory and it worked fine on the tablet.I would NEVER recommend this tablet to a friend, unless that person is a techno-masochist. It's a waste of money and probably too light to be an effective doorstop.You can spend significantly less and get the Nexus 7 latest generation tablet that runs Android. The screen resolution is superior to this tablet,  It is responsive to touch, something that you would take for granted normally. And there are tons of apps, something you can't say for the Windows app store.Maybe this tablet will be upgradable to Windows 8.1--that won't make it a better piece of hardware.

Preceding Atom CPUs ran Windows 7 and XP much more smoothly, even on less RAM.  The class of flash storage is also slower than the early SSDs including in netbooks of yore.While much of the slowness has to do with Windows 8 itself, the tablet has its own problems.  There have been driver issues, BSODs, and occasionally it just refuses to charge.  The power button sometimes doesn't seem to register, and wireless mysteriously disconnects, requiring at least a disconnect/reconnect and, more frustratingly and probably more often, a reboot.Now all this being said, this functions just fine a good majority of the time.  For basic tasks, it is often smooth, and the frequency of the problems could certainly be worse.  Battery life is not bad.  However, if you're used to a quality Android tablet or iPad, this is really a step down from a tablet perspective.  It can do more because it runs x86 Windows, but it doesn't do the things cheaper tablets do as well, as reliably, or as fast.The overpriced keyboard/case combo that is sold separately is a near-necessity, and unfortunately not that great.  It attaches by magnet insecurely and just isn't very functional.It is not so bad I'll sell it or return it, but for the price, buy the netbook you wanted and an iPad or Android tablet.

I am typing this review on a screen and once you get used to the keyboard, the typing becomes a breeze as it is for the other touch base devices.

I can run a number of Windows desktop programs (including moderately demanding ones like Office 2013, Logos Bible Software and Civilization IV). I can link my Asus by my home network to my desktop's DVD drive and hard drive, as well as my external hard drive. I can run a number of apps from the Start page.

You'll want an OTG cable to use USB devices, as this tablet has a microUSB port. There is also a microSD slot to add up to 64 GB of additional storage. The Asus does a good job with Bluetooth devices like a mouse and keyboard. You may want them if you use desktop programs often. The virtual keyboard works well for all the usual tablet uses.There are some limitations, of course. The Asus has 2 GB of RAM and no dedicated graphics memory, as well as an Atom processor. 3D gamers should look elsewhere. Some programs load more slowly than they do on my desktop, but not that slowly. The Windows app store is still in its infancy, so options are limited. I did get BlueStacks to work with some online help, so I can run some Android apps on it.

You just won't find a better deal with as good and reputable brand like Asus for the money.  I just received this tablet today and I'm sorry to say that I'm less than impressed.  Not on Asus' part, but Microsoft's.  Windows 8 is a beautiful new and innovative UI with A LOT of room for improvement.  I feel that Microsoft has A LOT of work to do with developing more functionality with the new \"Metro\" Start Screen.  It is definitely something made for touch, the problem is the Windows Store is a ghost town of virtually worthless apps.  Right now, any tablet running Windows 8 is essentially a Windows 7 UI with a cheap frosting overlay that is the Windows 8 UI.  Windows 8 itself is alright, definitely takes some getting used to, but the more support they get from major companies for their Metro UI Start Screen via the Windows Store, the better the system will become.And there is one thing I want to let everyone know.  BE WARNED, navigating the standard \"classic\" UI from the desktop screen to the internet, folders, applications, etc. is nothing short of a nightmare.  And this has nothing to do with just this tablet, it's any tablet running Windows 8.  The classic \"Desktop\" UI simply does not translate to touch compatibility.  Even with a stylus, it was a nightmare.  Navigating from screen to screen on the standard Firefox browser was difficult.  The screen is just so small that when you go to click on anything it doesn't always register the right thing that you're touching.I think Microsoft should have made a version of Windows 8 SPECIFICALLY For tablets, and Windows RT was NOT the answer.  Simply put, the classic Windows \"Desktop\" needs to be updated or dropped altogether.  If you are using a TOUCH SCREEN tablet, everything needs to be optimized for touch.Windows 8 tablets, a wonderfully functional idea on paper.  Terrible in practical application.So for those of you on the dividing line with getting a Windows Tablet, Android or Apple IOS.  Save the money and either get a laptop or if you really just want to play some games get an Android Tablet.

I have no complaints about performance so far. It has 2 gigs of RAM  AND 64 GB of storage.The build quality is excellent. It looks great, feels great, and is well thought out. The screen is gorgeous and very responsive. In fact, I am typing this review on it right now.Overall, I love it! There are more expensive and probably better performing Windows tablets out there. But none are in this price point, and few run the FULL version of Windows 8.

I would have purchased it here, but the $300 savings due to the warranty trade-in was something that made it worth dealing with BBY (add in the AMZ price matching for taking an extra $40 off the device! YAY Amazon!).I really like this tablet, it can do *almost* anything a normal laptop can do.  I am a power-user as a computer professional and had to get used to the fact that my normal usage patterns would bring this thing to it's knees.  Do NOT think that this is a desktop/laptop replacement as the Surface Pro is.  It's not, it's not a knock on the device as there's a WORLD of difference between a quad-core Atom and a quad-core i5 processor and there are no USB ports.  For the price of any other Atom 1.8GHz Windows 8 tablet, why spend more?  You don't get any more memory (only 2GB, but it's a tablet) or processor speed/power with those for the extra $100 price tag that most of them carry.All that said, I use this thing almost daily and it can do almost anything that I need it to (like I said, I have laptops and a desktop for a reason. I'm a power user). If all you do is surf the web, email, and use Facebook/G+ then maybe you could use it as a much more svelte laptop replacement.  I use this mostly for recipes (so much nicer to wipe a screen than read a wet/messy recipe), reading/studying, and Xbox Smartglass in addition to the aforementioned tasks and it holds up quite nicely.  The only thing that's kind of disappointing is the lack of a 5Ghz radio for Dual-band Wireless-N support.

It CANNOT be used as a USB port to transfer data.  That makes it very inconvenient to transfer large files to the tablet which cannot be easily transferred via email or some other wifi method.  If I had known that I would never have bout this tablet.  I was told all I needed was an adapter to use it as a regular USB port to transfer files to the tablet which I need to make it productive.  I contacted Asus help which after 2 days first told me to try resetting the tablet to its factory settings (which of course wiped out all my apps and customized settings) and try again.  That took several hours after which it still didn't work.  Then I contact Asus help again and was told the micro-USB port CANNOT be used to transfer data.  Its only function is for charging the tablet.  Why do they call it a \"micro-USB\" port then?  It's not any form of USB port other than it looks like one and you can use a USB cable for charging.Also, the manual is worthless other than to show you a picture of the front and rear of the tablet and where buttons and connections are.  Even on line the only instructions posted are the exact same manual with no greater explanation of how to use the device.Then there is Windows 8 and IE 10.  As usual, Microsoft has changed things around so that all the ways you are used to doing things no longer work.  Places you are used to looking for things are no longer there.  They claim the \"Desktop\" will function just like the old Windows we're all used to which for the most part is true (although good luck navigating with your finger on a touchscreen) but in the few days I have had the device I have run into a number of programs (and websites) that do not function 100% correctly in the Windows 8 and IE 10 environment.  Using Chrome to surf the web just ran into different obstacles on various sites.If you purchase the optional keyboard (and you pretty much have to in order to use the \"Desktop\" as well as to follow the Asus help instructions which tell you to select the \"Shift key\"), beware it is very flimsy and cumbersome.  The \"Transleve\" is just a foldable cover that awkwardly connects to the tablet or the keyboard with magnets.  Essentially, there are three separate elements (tablet, keyboard and \"sleeve\") that do not integrate well together.  It is nothing like docking the tablet to a keyboard which serves as a stand.  Do not try to use these on your lap or in bed!  On a desk they are barely manageable.  The tablet slides out of the stand (aka folded \"transleve\") if you blow on it.The battery life is very disappointing.  Even without extensive video use, it has lasted 5.5 hours at best.  Also, the manual does say do not leave the tablet charging for extended periods of time -- like overnight when most of us would charge it?The automatic display light level must be turned off.  Otherwise, it changes the screen brightness every few seconds which is very annoying.The only good thing is that the processor appears to be pretty fast with little dead time between operations.  Video plays well although the display is not the greatest.  Audio is allegedly \"stereo\" but from only one corner of the back of the tablet.Overall, a very disappointing product which Amazon will be receiving back shortly.", "Title": "Beware of Misleading Asus Claims", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "wcg70", "ReviewID": "R2P9OW2G5FL49S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this on Friday, 2/22, at Best Buy, and returned it today (2/25) for an Ipad.
