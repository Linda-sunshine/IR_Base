He is a writer for a living and wanted to be able to use this anyplace to write or research.  We are very pleased with the size, screen (picture is incredible), and response time.  One of his requirements was for the tablet to have USB ports, and this does. The price is very reasonable for the quality of the product and when it is paired with the Nokia keyboard, this is a tablet that functions as any laptop.  We purchased it with cellular capability and he is able to work with it almost anywhere.  My only issue is that I own an iPad and am not used to working with the Windows system.", "Title": "Very nice tablet", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00HUVK6B0", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
