Fry", "ReviewID": "R1FRXIR5BWGQJB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not only are these quite expensive, for what they are, I've had the rubber pads become unglued and slide off on both of the units I purchased.  Despite very careful use (my iPads tend to stay put on their stands), I've had 6 of 8 rubber pads (on two separate stands) slide down out of position or fall off completely, leaving sticky glue residue where the pads should be.Customer service mailed me replacement pads(along with rather exacting instructions on how to install them), and despite following directions to a 'T' the replacements soon began sliding off as well.So I've spent $150 + shipping, on stands that have a fundamental design flaw.  I certainly would've looked elsewhere if I'd known. These 5 star reviews are coming from people who haven't used the product for a meaningful length of time.", "Title": "Be warned: the pads WILL slide off", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "R.

The wireless keyboard fits nicely underneath and the iPad looks so proud sitting there.  Do you need it?  Well, I guess that depends on what it's needed for.  If you plan on using it on a desk or where you will be using a keyboard then it may be just what you want.  I just wanted something to set by my stereo so I can use the iPad as a jukebox so to speak.  This works but it has a big footprint, can't adjust the viewing angle, tight spaces you can forget about it.  It rocks alittle if you're touching the screen when upright.  Nice product though, just too expensive.I purchased the Targus Mini Stand about 1 week before this stand.  To be honest I like the Targus better for my needs.  It is small, doesn't rock, looks nice and it only cost $18 bucks.  If you wanted to take it with you it would fit into your bag with ease.  So, between the two I'd have to go with the Targus Mini Stand.  That being said the Stabile stand is still very nice.

However, if you are looking for something portable... this is not it.  This puppy is heavy!  Not that you can't easily move it around in the home... you can.
