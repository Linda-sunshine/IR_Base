[g]I purchased this bag in 2006 and again in 2011. An amazing quality product. It has room for a 15'' laptop and much more. It has several compartments meant to keep different things like pen, USB drive, portable hard drive and many more. Unfortunately I think the makers have stopped making this product. The comparable replacement does not quite match the standards of this one. Hence I decided to get another one before they run out of stock.

[g]$600 for a low end phone GSM phone? No 3G, GPS, wifi or anything and more expensive than an iPhone or a full featured Android? Wow this should be the worst deal of the century.

[m]I'm very happy with these cables. A lot of people have this strange idea that "digital cables" need to be incredibly expensive, but they clearly don't. It's either gonna work, or it's not, and by "not" work, I mean you'll either hear nothing, or your audio will be on and off, broken up. This cable works fine, and it appears to be MUCH higher quality than an optical cable I received with my sound card.\I don't care what anyone says, you will not hear a "difference in audio quality" between a cheap, and expensive optical cable. The data is being sent digitally as light pulses - you don't get good or bad light pulses.. they either make it from one end to the other, or they don't. You will not hear a difference in quality. You will either hear sound, or NO sound. That is what digital means - 1 or 0, on or off.Cheap, works well, no problems. Don't ever buy some overpriced digital cable, based on "quality" lies.

[g]It just seems like it is. The author supports thoughtless reproduction to create cannon fodder for the "End Times," and never using the faculty of reason that God gave us. These Talibangelicals oppress their women, beat their children, and blame it all on God.This isn't Christian. It's just crazy. Somebody needs to bone up on their Beatitudes.

[g]James Dobson, himself an admitted victim of child abuse, tries to carry on that sadistic, very un-Christian tradition here. Don't bother reading this book -- memorize the Sermon on the Mount instead. Practice the Golden Rule.

[m]Around pp. 165-167, in the essay "The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction," LeGuin discusses the possibility that the first human invention was not the weapon, but the container -- the sling, the sack, the bag, the carrier. (I remembered it as "the vessel," but that term doesn't appear in the book.) What good is generating a lot of stuff to eat if you don't have any way to get it back to camp? She argues the point persuasively and passionately.I read this book in 1991 or 1992, nearly 20 years ago. I've not seen the idea anywhere else (although she cites an anthropologist writing in 1975) but it has shaped my perception since. Not to diminish the rest of the book, but this single idea in this one essay is, I believe, worth getting the whole book for.

[m]The main character, Sophie Kinse-- I mean Becky Bloomwood, is so blooming ridiculous, you will likely find it humorous unless you are too extremely put off by the immature and naive behavior. Kinsella puts together a verbal slapstick comedy, where the punchline is not physical violence but feminine vapidity.The point is not to have sophisticated supporting characters or profound prose-- or a realistic plot, but just an escape and a jolly good time with a character that young women can apparently both identify with and look down on at the same time.

[m]This is an incredibly disappointing "work." Any true reader of Tolkien will marvel at the shallowness of this critique of his trilogy. I wonder if the authors did any more than peruse the book or, at best, speed-read through it to write this drivel. God is indeed present in Tolkien's work but this book is no road map to finding Him there. Far superior is "The Gospel Acording to Tolkien" by Ralph C. Wood. I would also suggest that serious readers pick up the Tolkien's "Silmarillion" in which God's act of creation literally leaps off the first page. Bruner and Ware would also do well to read this to deepen their own knowledge.

[m]This reproduction of an old ABC variety show is just sad, featuring cheap sets and 3rd-rate stars.Poor Margaret Hamilton's make-up was very badly done.Florence Henderson tries to sing and Paul Lynde does way too much mugging for the camera in place of witty dialogue.KISS lip-syncs 3 songs and they're not very good ones, plus Gene doesn't do the "tongue" thing.It certainly took me back to the 70's in the hurry, but not really in a good way.The whole disc is a paean to the "comedy genius" of Paul Lynde, if you imagine that.

[m]"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" Gal 6:7I open this review with scripture. Why you ask? WELL EVERY Christian movie ever made is a mockery of God. When Christians make a movie they never think of how to entertain they just try to drill the message in. The Point of Christian films should be toencourage people to live as Christ did. Not Judge others, accept people for who they are while not ignoring their sinful nature.Christian movies seldom give this message and it's made worse by drilling home personal opinions of the ministry behind these movies. Courageous is a fine example of this. The message of this film "BE A MAN BY FORCING CHRIST ON TO YOUR KIDS" This message is delivered through a melodramatic poorly edited sermon near the end of the film. It's less a Christian Sermon and looks more like when Hitler gave his speeches in Nazi Germany.Christians, some the mildness sheep with blind faith, Will love this others will see this as what it is. A Poor attempt to make a GOOD Christian movie.We have separation of Church and state...we also apparently have a separation of Church and entertainment.

[m]A chart Hannity uses in Deliver Us from Evil to explain how Congress, not President Ronald Reagan, ran up the humongous budgetary numbers in the 80s. Franken has enough sense to ask where the chart came from.The answer - from "The Ronald Reagan Homepage," a site not run by financial experts, or even anyone involved in the Reagan administration, just a fan of Ronald Reagan. Not the most reliable and impartial source.For more nonsense and lemming-like partisanship from this meat-head check out this piece of sh*t.

[m]It is amazing to me how the liberal Lutheran church organization allows liberal woman ministers and Gay ministers to publicly attack the evangelical ministers who stand for the gospel and reaching the lost for Christ. One wonders how how this woman was even allowed to be ordained a minister when the the bible clearly says the the Bishop should be the husband of one wife and woman are NOT permitted to teach in the Christian church. Also one needs to ask Barbara, how an infant is truly born again without faith in the gospel? So much for Lutheran liberal soterology.But to the book. Barbara would have you believe Paul taught a resurrection for both the good and the bad, but the truth is Paul the apostle taught only a catching away for the dead IN CHRIST and not for the wicked. Barabara Rossing needs to reread I Thessalonians a little more carefully. Also Barbara also needs to read early church fathers more carefully such as Justin Martyr. The early fathers held to a literal millennium where Christ would reign IN JERUSALEM for 1,000 years. A fact Barabara the Lutheran woman minister conveniently overlooks. Also Barbara Rossing' Jewish bigotry is apparant by dismissing any prophectic future for national Israel, when all one has to do is look to the middle east today and see national Israel is indeed a thriving nation today and has been since 1948. One wonders how all these jews could have returned to their national homeland unless God had a provential hand in it? Of course Barbara Rossingapparentprop hecticJewsprovincial and liberal Lutheran ministers will say, oh it was just allowed for them by the British Balfor act.Barbara RossingBalfour only purpose in having her book published was to trash gospel preaching evangelical ministers and try to convince her public that liberal Lutheranism is indeed the correct religion of the day, infant baby baptism and all along with ordaining woman and gays for the ministry

[m]Morrison has an agenda set forth in his book that neither the apostles, including Paul or Christians personally observed the Sabbath or Sunday. Morrison only believes Jesus and the Jews did at that time period.To me this is incredible, seeing that the apostles ALL were natural Jews from birth.I would like to ask Mr Morrison when did Jesus ever instruct his 12 apostles to abandon the Sabbath altogether and only go into the synagogues to witness the good news of Jesus? When? Also Morrison states that there were no Christians living then who observed the Sabbath day? Mr Morrison, did you forget about Lydia? Mr Morrison's whole purpose in his book is to say no day of the week is really important for Christians to observe at all. This book is just terrible scriptural apologetics

[g]I have owned a pair of Infinity Beta 20 for 4 years, and I am not a happy owner, not at all.First, the good ones - their high frequency reproduction is pretty good, and they do have little resonance.Now, the ugly, they have very poor mid-range, it is muddy and unclear, at any volume level. This is especially apparent for low pitched vocals. Just how bad does it sound? Well, my $15 Altec Lansing desktop speaker sounds clearer, and I paid $400 for them.Because of this experience, I have lost confidence in Infinity speakers. The C.M.M.D. is more of a marketing scheme, than real benefit.

[g]I used to think average headphones can beat most loudspeakers, well, until I've got the Boston Acoustics VR3. Now, only my $100 Shure earphone is clearer (but bass is not as good), and the VR3 has beaten all my other headphones (including a really good neo magnet monitor headphone).The VR3 is exceptionally clear from top to bottom. I actually changed it to 3-way active crossover tri-amp configuration, which removes the harsh distortions introduced by passive crossovers. Before the modification, the VR3 already shows its amazing talent. After the modification, it is a knockout!With the VR3, I am now rediscovering that my "bad" CDs are actually pretty good - I was fooled by poor speakers and headphones for so long - and VR3 is a true revelation.

[m]This product (and its companion 65224) is a necessity when you're tuning your carburetor, and have to get into it every other day. Holley's blue gaskets are designed to glue themselves to the carburetor body after just a couple hours of use. They claim that it seals better that way. But it can still leak, particularly when their gaskets are some times not well made. These are very well made, and well worth the cost.

[m]UPDATE 8/23/12: Trudeau contacted me based on my review & pictures here and sent me a new one. Excellent customer service, way to stand behind your product! I've changed my rating from 3 to 4. If, by some miracle, the handles no longer fill with water in the dishwasher I'll up it to 5.I'm on my fourth or fifth garlic press, all having either broken or presented some major design flaw.The Trudeau Garlic Press does a great job of mincing garlic and the cleaning mechanism works very well.Unfortunately it's hollow and unsealed and fills with dirty water in the dishwasher. A poor feature in a "dishwasher safe" product!If you intend to hand wash your press then this is a great choice. If not, you may want to keep looking.Update 1/1/12:It served me well for four years but last night snapped trying to mince a clove of garlic. See pics.

[m]Anyone with pets or kids should have a jug of this around. In addition to spot cleanups I use it in the carpet shampooer (I have the Bissel Pro-Heat and SpotBot). It doesn't make suds and you don't need to rinse it completely--in fact it's probably better not to so you leave the enzymes behind to keep working.

[m]Simin Ghanem has an amazing operatic voice. In fact, she studied to be an Opera singer. In the Iran of the late 60s as a side project, she started doing vocal sessions for radio leading to her massive first hit "Golak e Cheshaat" with music written by the movie score writer Lacini. The sparsely spaced tune left lot of space for simin's grandeous voice to reach its maximum glory. Other great songs continued including the absolute classic: "Laneye Moor (rat hole" which popularly is better known for its opening line: Gol e Goldoon. The only problem with this compilation is that it doesnt seam to have been made from the original masters, and therefore we are unable to enjoy the recordings in their absolute glory. Also the record company releasing this CD has not included a booklet with information about the recordings or the artist.

[m]This was Viguen's last production before his passing away in October 2003.The song "Baazgasht (return)" is a luxurious production that has real acoustic drums and guitars. It has been nicely engineered and sounds fantastic. His voice fits perfectly, the melancholic song. The lyrics are perfect for being one of his last recordings, since they give a nice retrospective on the significance of this goodlooking male singer for pop music in Iran.

[g]Okaye, this toy arrived in a little padded envelope. It was tiny. It does not look like the photo. It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker. I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny! It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse. My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes. She's 13 lbs. I'm not crazy about the velcro and how you can take the squeakers out, that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out.
x
[m]This goose is smaller than our coleman toys, but the squeaker is buried in the toy so it's difficult for a smaller dog to squeak unless they have big mouths. It's more for a medium size dog. I did not hear honking! Anyhow, I liked the pheasant better for a small dog even though it's not a plush. Quality could be better but prices are more than reasonable, so that all dogs can have toys.

[m]Well, John Connolly has done it again. Slightly less complicated than his initial offering, this book is no by no means less entertaining. It opens, alternating between a shootout in an ocean front parking lot in Maine and an old woman escaping from a home for the elderly. Thus, a chain of events have been kicked off drawing in the Mob, a trouble maker deliquent on his child support, a pair of killer elites and a phantom serial killer who claims the woods of Maine as his home. And who, of course, could better sort everything out than Bird Parker and his infamous partners Angel and Louis.This book was a page turner. Dark and descriptive with some excellent side characters. John Connolly is truly a master story teller and what a story he has to tell here. Hope you all enjoy this book as much as me.

[g]If you enjoy bands like Creed and Kid Rock and current hard rock/alternative music ignore this review. This is for those who like I, much prefer Phish, Allman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. Pearl Jam used to be my favorite band...My interest in the band faded after Vitalogy, but I decided to pick up this CD because I am going to see them live this summer. I don't want to sound like a 95 year old woman, but to me it sounds like a bunch of noise with little focus. It is very difficult to distinguish each guitar part. It seems like there is so much distortion and reverb on the songs that they all mesh together to form a mass of noise. The slow songs are certainly not up to the standards of anything off of their first three albums. I wasn't expecting another &quot;Ten&quot; but didn't expect a 2 star album.

[m]After hearing the Big Wu's first album, &quot;Tracking Buffalo through the Bathtub,&quot; I immediately sought out their other music. This being their latest studio CD, I expected a lot. The biggest problem I found was a lack of exciting or even catchy songs. And the playing isn't bad, just a little boring. Supposedly (source from Rhombus Web forums) the producer was going for a &quot;pop&quot; feel, which is accomplished in a polished sound. The problem is, by polishing away the instrumental sections in which the Wu excels, you place the burden on the songwriting. And to reiterate, the straight songs aren't bad, just a bit unexciting. To the album's credit, song 2, &quot;Minnesota Moon&quot; has a real swinging feel to it, which I really enjoy. I'd like to also add that in the context of the band's natural setting (a live performance) some of these songs such as &quot;Boxing Day&quot; are given new life. Still unless you're a die-hard Wu fan and have to own every CD, put this one at the end of your list.

[m]This program is easy to use and has a great interface, two key points. You can plug your guitar right into your line in slot (foregoing any effects though). This is a great program for anyone who has musical ideas to convey, but has lacked a reasonably priced method of recording them. You get 8 seperate tracks to fiddle with, which proves sufficient in most cases. It comes with the drag and drop drummer lite edition, which is cool at first, but it seems like it is just a ploy to get the user to buy the real edition with an more adequate number of fills and beats. It is time consuming to create each track, but proves worth it in the end. The files can easily be saved as .wavs and burnt to CD. The mp3 encoder is a trial only with 20 uses. This is important because even if you save your files to .wavs, they have security features that prevent them from being encoded into mp3s (even by other programs). One more problem is that you can only begin recording at the beginning of a measure, which can be irritating. Overall though, this product has proved hours (and hours) of fun! (Note this version is not quite outdated, and more recent editions of the program are available).
xx
[g]Listened to in context, I realize that this is the music of a tortured soul who is genuinely relecting his fragmented psyche through his craft. Without this biography in mind, this live recording sounds like a severely retarded man was altruistically given a chance to play his songs in front of a crowd. The AMG review likens his music to a Van Gogh painting, but the only connection I could see was that while listening, I badly wanted to sever my ears to silence the madness. While that was too drastic a measure, I couldn't help thinking, why me?

[m]I purchased this model almost 5 years ago. I am still on the same 9v battery despite leaving it on a couple of times for awhile by accident. I have used it on everything from checking batteries for the kids' toys to electrical work around the house. This is a very versatile checker and has a high max AC and DC load for the price (more than some twice the price). My home is older and I've done a lot of electrical work with it including adding breakers to the main electrical panel and working with the fuse box (I have both in my house). The instructions are a bit lacking but since my father was a line man and electrical contractor growing up we always had something like this around the house, so I know how to use it (plus I paid attention in science class and didn't go to school in Kansas ;) I am just now looking for a replacement lead because the insulation cracked on the black one, but that's my own fault for inappropriately storing it while wrapping the wires around the device instead of unplugging them from the device :( I was about to by another one, but then i found the replacement part for about $5.

[g]I liked the early Kay Scarpetta novels for the forensic science, but the real "victim" in every novel is Kay Scarpetta (Cornwell's alter ego) herself. Her career is in jeopardy, her credibility, her niece's life, her own life...The poor ripped-up murder victims are as nothing to Scarpetta's problems.Typically, "Portrait of a Killer" begins with the angst of its author. "It has always been easier for me to get angry than to show fear or loss, and I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert." A simple invitation to visit Scotland Yard is fraught with moral ramifications: "It would have been a betrayal of what I am and an insult to Scotland Yard and every law enforcer in Christendom for me to be 'tired' the day Linda Fairstein said she could arrange a tour." Her self-absorption is almost comical.Cornwell makes no argument that comes close to justifying her conviction that Sickert was the Ripper. She seems to have formed her opinion of Sickert's guilt based on his art ("I saw evil"), then examined his life for facts to justify that opinion. Her presentation is poor: Facts about the murders, cultural history of the Victorian era, art criticism, and descriptions of modern forensic science are presented in a random jumble. Her own assumptions contradict themselves; after telling us that Sickert preferred his victims ugly and deformed, she offers no word of explanation as to why the Ripper's most grisly murder was of the young attractive Mary Kelly.I have no theory as to who the Ripper was; he may even have been Walter Sickert, but certainly not based on this compilation of "evidence"!

[m]Of all Herzog's documentaries, this film most closely follows actual events without the director indulging himself in "ecstatic truth"-telling. Neither is he the flat-brained teller of the "accountant's truth." The horror of both the crime and capital punishment need no poetic or operatic treatment. This is not an anti-death penalty film as some have accused. Herzog does state that he is opposed to capital punishment, that he respects human life, but that is as far as he goes. He does not overly empathize with the accused. In fact, his film is dedicated to the victims' families.

[m]I really wanted to like Spore, and I even (was foolish enough to have) bought the game knowing about the SecuROM controversy. Unfortunately, the game experience is very watered down.The cell stage is extraordinarily basic (not terribly surprising, given that you're playing a single-celled organism. You swim around, eating plant matter, meat that's floating around, or smaller creatures. You try to avoid the big creatures that want to eat you. Creature stage is a bit more coplex, but not much. Tribe and civilization stages are essentially dumbed-down versions of any civ-type or RTS game released over the last decade or so. As to the space stage, it's about as much fun as Master of Orion III was. Which is to say, not much.What is interesting is the robust suite of creation tools. You've got a lot of freedom to make some truly interesting creatures, building, spaceships, etc. Unfortunately, you need to buy the expansion pack in order to get many of the creature body part options that should have been in the game in the initial release. If you're inclined to tinker and see what you can come up with, you'll likely enjoy the game. Otherwise, if your tastes run to casual gaming, you may like this. If you're looking for a serious species simulation, I regret to say that Spore isn't it.And, of course, it's published by EA, so one must take into account that the company injects malware into your computer when you load the game.

[m]I'm still not seeing the flaws some people have complained about here. The outer box is basic, but not really cheap or flimsy. The individual disc cases and labels are perfectly adequate. I suppose they could be even more fancy and elaborate...but do I really care? No.I have no complaints about the quality of the discs or the playback. With the first five discs the movie does start right up when you insert the disc, rather than going first to a menu screen. Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 have proper menus that come up first, and separate special features discs with more and better extras. But there *are* bonus features on the first five discs--trailers, deleted scenes, short interviews with cast and crew, the usual stuff. You can access them by pressing the "disc menu" button on your remote, or you can sit through all the multi-lingual anti-piracy warnings after the end credits--the menu will pop up. I imagine there would be more goodies on the deluxe edition discs, but I didn't pay the cost of the deluxe edition, did I? If you're looking at this set I'm betting a lot of you don't want to, either.I think this *is* the region-free version that other reviewers are recommending that you order from Amazon.co.uk. The URL printed on the disc cases is warnerbros.co.uk. The age rating symbols on the box are the ones awarded by the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office. After each movie ends, you see dozens of anti-piracy warnings, in every language under the sun--I've never seen that on a US version DVD. Also, everywhere in the first film--on the packaging, on the disc, in the titles, in the dialog--they refer to the "philosopher's stone" rather than the "sorcerer's stone." (The original UK book title was "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" but the US publisher thought that would put off American readers, so they dumbed it down to "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." They did the same with the movie so as not confuse fans of the book. But they only changed it in the US--everywhere else it was always "Philosopher's Stone." Personally, I find having the movie with the original title a plus!) The one thing I cannot find anywhere on the discs or packaging is the region code--but clearly, these are not the standard US editions.

[m]I bought these headphones about 10 years ago, and they have come in quite handy. I really have never like earbuds as they come out of my ears too easily. These headphones stay on my head even during vigorous activity.Sound quality is above average, but bass response is average. You simply will not get the same thumping bass as a good pair of earbuds.The only other con is that the headphone cable is a bit on the short side.However, for something cheap that you can abuse and depend on for years, it works very well.

[m]While BONNIE SCOTLAND doesn't qualify as a classic, it's still lots of fun for Laurel and Hardy fans. The film's main problem is it's uncomfortable grafting of the boy's comedy onto a melodramatic B-picture storyline. June Lang and William Janney are the romantic leads, but unfortunately their roles are rather shallow and unsympathetic. Thankfully, Stan and Ollie's scenes are good enough to keep the film moving and enjoyable. Highlights include the boys innocently wreaking havoc in a Scottish boarding house, their improvised dance to &quot;One Hundred Pipers,&quot; and Stan's constant inability to keep in step with the rest of the Scottish army unit! There are also good comic moments from James Finalyson, Mary Gordon and diminutive Daphne Pollard (hilarious as a cockney chambermaid). The picture and sound on this video transfer are sharp and clear.

[g]Be thankful if you watch this on a Showtime premium cable channel, because if you spend cash on renting it you would probably become angry. It is a low cost production with mediocre writing and a poor story line. But Lauren Holly is, as always, lovely to look at. Horror, sci fi, thriller ....who knows what category this flick belongs in. If you have an alternative, take it.

[g]One shouldn't get to complain about having wasted time and money on a propaganda piece when the packaging already states a disclaimer: "From the company that brought you An Inconvenient Truth"But complain I will.This "documentary" is a brainwash session prepared by and for people who have blinders on. Like any true propaganda film, facts are mixed with inaccuracies and incomplete information, so that the viewer is left with a wrong impression of reality, or an unstated blatant lie.An example of incomplete information is the treatment of corn, and how it's used by Big Bad Businesses. The movie presents corn as the source of American obesity, without regard to the countless studies that show that primary causes for obesity are a dramatic increase in caloric intake and lack of exercise. The standard applied to causality between corn and obesity is such that one could equally well say that spoons are the cause for obesity in America.Strangely the "documentary" has no actual scientific experts offering opinions, perhaps because such interviews were not deemed necessary, or their content ran contrary to whatever agenda the producers have.One underlying tone is that Big Bad Corporations are out to get the farmer and the consumer, and that they are enabled by Bad Evil People, such as anyone appointed by President GW Bush. The producers don't seem to find it inconvenient to gloss over the fact that agricultural policies and the Big Bad Corporations depicted go back decades, not just the 8 years from 2001 to 2008, and that appointees of Presidents Clinton and Carter are of necessity engaging in the same Bad Evil activities.In short, save your money and time, unless you like your blinders firmly planted right where they are.

[g]The movie is extraordinary. I hate the Blue-ray version of the movie! Save your money... vhs or dvd better represent the original. The Blue-ray version has been butchered! Black and white movies colorized is off my list also... And would someone please tell me how to start the movie without the previews and introductions? I have no interest in the opinions of others about the movie prior to watching the movie. And forcing me to watch previews of other movies are best left to copies from Blockbuster or the theater. $2000 for a new tv, new cable box, new receiver, new Blue-ray player and it sucks! And $20+ for the Blue-ray. Fox should pay me to watch the previews. The DVD version stays and the new Blue-ray version is to be listed on eBay later tonight.

[m]Excellent shoe storage. The shelves are designed to fit spaces 26" to 48" as each set includes a "A" size and a "B" size. For those attempting to fit a space between 26" and 48" the different sizes is ideal; but for those happy with the 26" the different sizes is frustrating as the shelves do not fit consistently. No instructions are included. The house is older and the studs in the walls are spaced inconsistently so I mounted two 1x3 boards to horizontally top and bottom to mount the hanging rails and the uprights. Such an installation also allows for easier movement of the upgrights without further damage to the walls and without further efforts to find studs. The key to any similar installation is securing the handing rails and uprights securely and only studs or a board attached to a board would suffice. Do your homework in advance as different stores have different products and the products do work together. One store has heavy hanging rails but another store has the shoe storage and both work quite well together. The Rubbermaid web site does not list all available products.

[g]this book is typical of mr niederman's &#34;vc andrews&#34; books. full of whiny brats and lame villians. honestly, even the butler in fita was more evil than the halfbrothers. in response to casey snydets statement &#34;what 16 year old calld her mother mommy&#34; answer :ALL VC ANDREWS CHARACTERS!!!!!! seriously i stopped calling mine that when i was five. oh and mr neiderman please stop referring the male sex organ as &#34;hardness&#34; or &#34;manliness&#34; it sounds so...stupid. and please stop having the characters go into detail about their periods and the proper way to insert a tampon. a real woman knows sbout this and does not go out of het way to mention it. whats next - a character who vividly describes her bowel movements?

[g]The book is actually neither science fiction nor fantasy. It's an historical novel. Although it's about a trip to the 14th century, I could imagine a similar story about a mission to any isolated place, even in our own time. That said, the idea of sending historians to the past makes a very interesting premise with all kinds of possible stories. The fact that the time travel process magically eliminates any acts which could alter history is obviously absurd, but it at least allows the author to avoid such issues.However, the achievement falls far short of the possibility. There's essentially no plot- a young researcher (Kivrin) in 2050 is accidentally sent to the year of the Black Death by a technician ill with the flu. The reader knows this before he even opens the book, thanks to the summary on the flyleaf. However, it takes almost 300 pages before anyone involved in the story knows it. I found myself skimming large portions hoping I would get to something interesting. This could have a very good book if the page count were cut in half.In the interim, the author plagues us (pun intended) with a set of characters (Gilcrist, Mrs. Gaddson, the American bell ringers, Finch,...) who are annoying caricatures and who are ultimately irrelevant to the story. All of these, plus even the main characters, plod around for 400 pages or so doing trivial, irrational and contradictory things. Kivrin and Colin (the pre-teen forced to spend Christmas with Mr. Dunworthy) are the only modern characters who seem human.The science of the future world is absurd. It has video phones but no cell phones (even when Ms. Willis wrote this book there were cell phones) and almost no other useful technologies. Even ones that exist are ignored. For example, more than half Kivrin's story is taken up with her vain attempts to re-find the drop location, but it turns out that she could have simply taken a "locator" device with her.The last 150 or so pages contain whatever plot exists and are somewhat more interesting. However, I found the conclusion quite unsatisfactory. The author kills off almost everyone and the story just tails off.Even with all the above, my feelings are a bit ambiguous. Ms. Willis' command of the language is good, which is a rare quality. Any short excerpt from the book reads well- it's the cumulative effect of boring characters and inaction that bother me. I enjoyed some of Kivrin's story and most of the characters in 1348, although I'm skeptical of the historical accuracy of many of the descriptions. The 14th century sounds too much like farm life as described by my grandparents in the rural south.

[m]I have had this tent up for almost 3 yrs. I only take it down when it snows. I live in Michigan. We have had winds over 80 miles an hour, with hail and rain. This tent stood up to it all!! It is staked down in grass in my back yard, and doesn't move. It also remains dry under the tent. The only thing I would like to see changed is a top air vent (for the 80 mile an hour winds), however then it would no longer be waterproof! LOVE IT LOVE IT!! They make them in Green, Black , Bronze, Red, Blue, and Checkered. I would pay the extra money and get a darker color due to sun glare. :)

[m]I bought this set primarily for the 'Jesse James' movie, which is dark, slow paced and cerebral, and features fine acting by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. This film may bore you if you are looking for action or plot twists, and you'll know if it's right for you after about the first 15 or so minutes. If you can stick with it, Casey Affleck's smoldering performance is a revelation.I had not seen "Wyatt Earp" before and it proved to be quite a pleasant surprise. It came out a year after "Tombstone" and wasn't as successful I guess, but this film strikes a good balance between being too violent or too fawning/watered down. It pretty much follows the same main storyline as "Tombstone" with the addition of showing events that mold the younger Wyatt into the man he becomes by the time he arrives at Tombstone.Dennis Quaid does a good job with the Doc Holliday role, but Val Kilmer's performance will always be more memorable.The movie clocks in at a bit over three hours, however it never dragged for me.The cinematography in "Wyatt Earp" is beautiful, and the Blu-ray transfer is excellent - there are many dark/shadowy scenes that are rich in detail and have very little or no noise. The frequent daytime panoramas are gorgeous. Warner did a wonderful job here.If you want to add two very different, good westerns to your Blue-ray collection, this combo set is a steal.

[m]Please note that this album isn't exclusively Ragtime - it also contains some stride/jazz pieces.If Ragtime is what you are after, check out Richard Dowling's other album,World's Greatest Piano Rags. It's excellent.When Dowling sticks to the original compostion, the results are very pleasing. He does at times take a different tact to playing certain phrases - occasionally swapping legato for staccato (and vice-versa), and this gives him a kind-of signature sound (he doesn't do this excessively).It's when he takes more of an artistic license with embelishments that I'm tempted to hit the fast forward button. For example, his excursions on "The Entertainer" seem rather dubious to me.For the most part though, this album is quite listenable (especially liked "Handful of Keys" and "Magnetic Rag").

[m]To this day, "Deliverance" (along with "Blue Velvet and "Blood Simple") is one of the most bizarre mainstream movies you are likely to see.It's a distinctive suspense thriller with a simple plot and great acting that has stood the test of time.The Blu-ray transfer is very good for a movie of this vintage - there is no noise whatsoever in most of the dark & shadowy scenes, BUT they really had trouble with the scene where Jon Voight's character scales the rock cliff - this sequence is plagued with all manner of artifacts. Overall, still worth getting if you are a fan of this film.The disc also includes an interesting retrospective (in standard def).I hadn't seen this movie in a long time and DID have to laugh at some of the continuity errors here, considering the budget and attention to detail otherwise.My favorite is the sequence early in the film when the foursome initially set off in their canoes - Ronny Cox's hat magically disappears and reappears several times - it's clearly two different takes that were cut & pasted together. Pretty funny.

[m]I own several Masque titles that I've bought for next to nothing, and I've found that aside from being able to vary the number of computer opponents (I haven't seen a Masque game yet that allows you to change the number of opponents)the games by Masque are superior to their Hoyle counterparts, which concentrate more on bells and whistles than gameplay.For a little bit of money, you get a lot of nice games, something of interest for almost any age group - granted, the graphics & sounds are a bit dated, but I've seen worse, and you do have the option to change the look of the cards, tiles, and in some cases the playing background.I loaded this game on a Vista Based computer, and it plays fine - you have the choice of which game(s) you want to install, and if you install the whole ball of wax, you can run the game without keeping the disk in the drive. The Help files work fine in Vista (several older games I own have Help files that are incompatible with Vista).The main reason I bought this title was for the card game selection - Includes: Spades, Hearts, Whist, Euchre, Canasta, Cribbage, Gin Rummy, Rummy, Old Maid, Crazy 8's and Go Fish among others.The Solitaire Antics game has tons of different variations of solitaire, with lots of game options, including the ability to see valid moves if you want, and a no moves left warning.The Mahjongg Tile game is probably the weakest of the three for me simply because I have a version on my Kindle Fire (Random Mahjongg) that has spoiled me for other Mahjongg games. If you are new to Mahjongg, the Masque Mahjongg game is a great place to start.
xxxxxxx
[m]I like solitaire games, but I especially like "episodic" solitaire games, where you have to win in order to progress towards some higher goal.The Jewel Quest series of solitaire games offer just that - plus you have the option of playing just the card game, or the "Full Quest," which includes a mini game involving the original Jewel Quest board (basically a match 3 type game). This first Jewel Quest Solitaire game has two "books" of different solitaire layouts, and a number of special wild cards are introduced as you progress up the levels. You can also undo some of your last few moves (including wild card moves), and if you are quick enough, you can also undo your very last move if you lost the hand - even with this amount of leeway, you'll still run into plenty of "oh, darn" moments when you lose by one card.This game is just challenging enough where you probably won't plow through and complete it in a couple of days, nor is it too frustrating to make you give up, either - it's just hard enough to be compelling and fun for short breaks- my idea of the perfect casual game.

[m]This movie is like a cross between "Cliffhanger," "Deliverance," and "Alien".I'm not normally squeamish about confined spaces, but some of the "tight" shots in this film are so well done that you could just sense the distress the characters were experiencing. Really edge-of-your-seat stuff.Added to that, this film is a couple notches above the typical pick 'em off one at a time horror film. Like "Alien," it is well paced, and the characters have some dimension.One star off for the Blu-ray transfer - there's some crystal shots, but most of the story takes place in a dimly lit cave - Hi Def Digest says "Chroma noise is also not an issue" in this film, but I beg to differ.Unless there are different transfers available for this film, there's a lot of video noise in many scenes.Still one to own, or at least worth seeing at least once if you are a fan of scary/thriller films.

[g]This not really a novel, it's a book-length essay on the philosophy of quantum mechanics.The characters are just mouthpieces, and they all talk like they're giving a physics lecture -- even the protagonist, who's supposed to be a cop. I wouldn't have minded a protagonist who was a physicist and spent all his time giving physics lectures, but a protagonist who is a cop and spends all his time giving physics lectures makes for a pretty deadly lack of believability. Egan also shoots himself in the foot by giving the protagonist reasons to emote (a murdered wife who walks on stage sometimes as a ghost) but making him emotionless (because of brain modifications he's carried out on himself). I could have dealt with a protagonist who was Mr. Spock, but if you're going to give Spock a deep reason to emote, you've got to do something dramatically with that conflict between reason and emotion.The philosophy and science are not really very believable, either. Egan has tried to find a way of dramatizing the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, but in doing that, it seems to me that he's twisted the Copenhagen interpretation into something different -- and more absurd -- than what it really is.

[m]We certainly can make a case for author's not getting married or divorced.I have seen examples where good authors who were married, thanked their spouses for all their patience, etc in first few books. Then a divorce occurred, and their writting stunk from that time on.Only in this case, I think marriage did Ms Hamilton in. A couple years ago, I noted with interest and good wishes that she had gotten married, but since then her writting has suffered and continues to suffer.Go, rent a cottage at beach, a cabin in the mountains! Do whatever it takes to get back your muse.

[m]I automatically get any work of fiction written by Mr Child, and found this one a little slow.I really liked the story line. The premise is interesting and not one I have run across before.That said, the hero was a little shallow and I found myself skipping pages of description to get to what was really going to happen next.All in all I liked the book, but wish I had bought the paperback instead of the hardcover.

[m]I have read this author before and ordered it based on her name.The first time I read it I was not happy with the book. If an author is going to make a universe, somewhere along the way you have to give enough information to tie everything together. The plot seemed disjointed and there were too many unanswered questions.For example: our heroine, who spends an inordinate time passed out, keeps asking how much time has passed since she arrived on planet: weeks, months, years, but we never get an answer. Also, her husband who was very possessive in the beginning of the book, was just cut out of the plot like a piece of bruised apple. What happened to him and the ship?I think part of my dislike was the physical makeup of the book itself. The book is kind of a cross between a normal paperback and a comic book. NOT that there are sketches/drawings in it, and it is much thicker than a comic book, but length x width, it is the same. The paper is crude and the cover not my cup of tea.And to top off all of the above, the weekend I read it, I had the flu, which could have colored my perceptions. So trying to be completely fair, a couple weeks later, I re-read it.I liked it better the 2nd time (of course I had the advantage this time of knowing where it was going). While I still didn't like the format of the book - it didn't suck. I think with a little judicious editing it could have been better and the storyline is one you won't come across often. That alone makes it worth the price.Well fellow reader, give it a go and see what you think. If nothing else it will help support a good author.

[m]Fellow Firefly fans watch out.I am a unshakable fan of Firefly and Serenity (show me a petition to bring it back or make another movie and I'll sign!). I already had the first release and I ordered this one based on the EXTENDED SCENES lure. If you are expecting a longer movie, more of a DIRECTOR'S CUT - this IS NOT IT. The movie is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST RELEASE. The extended scenes are included as a separate item on the DVD. Whoppee.I AM feeling MORE a little ripped off. I now have 2 exactly the same Serenity movies! Joss, honey, you can do better than this.

[m]I remmeber this book was the most amazing tale when i was a kid. I read it recently, and i was a bit taken aback by how easy it was to fly through. Maybe its a bit Harry Potteresque. For a kid, the characters jump out of the pages and take you into the world with them. I dont think ive ever been as encapsulated in a story ever again. I remmeber at the end of the 3rd book crying and crying because i felt all my freinds had just died. Sad eh?The one disturbing this i heard was the authors are Mormons, and the stuff about &quot;the true gods&quot; is them trying to push their religion is a kind of abstract way.This may also be complete rubbish.Anyway, i couldnt bring myslef to give it anything but 5 stars, as it pretty much was the defining series of my childhood.

[m]I guess I'm kind of a stickler for feeding my kitties ONLY food that I know is good for them *all* the time. There are several things in this book that are recommended by vets NOT to feed to your cats, such as processed cheese (not including cottage cheese). However, there are some neat things in there too, and the book does say, "in moderation." But, if you're a stickler like me, you could probably do better with the Whole Food Diet book. It depends on what you're after. Personally, I feel weird about feeding my kitties something that's bad for them even if it's once a year, and most of the recipes in this book are like that. If you feel okay with that occasional treat and don't worry easily, then this book is awesome!

[m]I teach introductory philosophy at the college level and was assigned this book three years ago. While it does have a multi-cultural approach it is very expensive, the introductory sections are not all that good, and it fails to have a section by itself dealing with the issue of death, which is comparable to having a text on religion without a unit on God. There are better, much cheaper books that are better suited to beginning students of philosophy. I am changing using this text after continuing complaints from students about its difficulty and cost. Students are the best consumers here. Perhaps a two semester, more advanced course in philosophy might better use this text.

[m]If there was a no star rating, this massager would get it! I purchased this foot massager last year, after seeing it on Oprah Show. Picked by a guest actress, as a must have in her 9th month of pregnacy. Oh, so NOT what I hoped for. 1st, opening box to find NO moving message function was a negative. 2nd, in turning it on... was just a HIGH powered vibrating box. Had my mother-in-law use it for just afew minutes, thinking it would help with nerve/circulation problems(Dr had recommended a messager for this)and she had hard time walking the next day! She has since gotten a moving base model with better speed modes and has worked well for her. And 3rd, the high cost is a big waste... just go out and get a $20 massager for the same quality as this one.

[m]Honestly, all I enjoyed from this movie was the gorgeous computer effects with the Transformers....but otherwise, it has a pretty lame plot. I thought I would possibly enjoy the humor in the film, but I felt like the director was forcing too much sexual jokes into the film (which I found to be more annoying than funny). Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out. I pretty much didn't care by the time the final battle came. I was a Transformer fan myself when I was a kid, but man, this movie just killed it.

[m]This is a gripping story about teenage Meliara's attempts to lead a band of rebels into war against a tyrannical king and against all odds. The bulk of the story deals with her capture by the enemy, her escape, and her ensuing flight throughout the countryside of Remalna, trying to evade King Galdran's men. Smith's writing is tight, and often lyrical - she's capable of expressing beautiful scenes dealing with nature, friendship, and kindness in the midst of the seemingly hopeless cause of Mel and her brother, Branaric.The action of "Crown Duel" is erratic, unpredictable, and far from clich&eacute;. This is well-suited to nave Meliara's disposition and impulsive actions. Both her foolhardy and more thoughtful, logical actions seem to land her in trouble. I like how Smith included the gritty reality of camp life and Mel's stint as a fugitive - too often these details seem to be missing in fantasy novels, possibly at the risk of sounding too mundane. But for Mel, her need to find food, water, or a bed for the night drive her actions as much as anything else.There are a few reasons why I felt the book didn't deserve a fifth star...throughout the course of the tale, Mel is rescued in the nick of time too often. I wish she'd fight or use her wits to find her own way out of a serious situation for once. Smith's attempt to give the brother a distinct, fun-loving voice seems very contrived - I'd like a nickel for every time Bran uses the silly expletive, "Life!" or the phrase, "Burn it, Mel..." And there is no map!! It's an old clich&eacute; that "No Tour of Fantasyland is complete without one," yet this book could have really used one. There are enough descriptions of the Tlanth countryside that Mel is so familiar with, and has even mapped herself, to warrant one. Obviously the geography of her world was very clear in Smith's own mind, but all of Mel's travels, military strategy, and landscape descriptions made no spatial sense at all.Still a very satisfying read that will leave you eager for the even better sequel.

[g]Came to the theatre today looking for more philosophical brain food for thought (similar to the Oracle and the Architect's dialogue in "Reloaded") than what delivered. Instead all the dialogue was just drivel, and many of the main characters (Morpheus in particular) were marginalized. The wagering between Morpheus/Trinity and the Merovingian created some excellent tension - which was negated, then forgotten. E.g. his request to "bring me the eyes of the Oracle" as he toys with 2 martini olives on a toothpick. Makes you shudder, eh? And the subway-station limbo world was an intriguing setting that I hoped they would explore more; instead the Oracle wager is quickly abandoned and Neo is whisked away.So, instead of true substance, the movie was overwhelmed with clich&eacute; and useless feely-good subplots. We have the overzealous (dare I say obnoxious) 16-year old who wants to fight in the war and somehow manages to outlast all the seasoned war generals. The Indian family that wanted to save their young daughter seemed an artificial ploy to extract some sympathy from the audience. And I wanted to bang my head against the wall during Trinity's long spiel to Neo, where all the old Hollywood "I love you" clich&eacute;s are recycled.The final fight between Smith and Neo in the rain seemed the high point of the movie - visually stunning and on par with the visuals of the prior films. But again, soo much potential that quickly plummets. It seemed the writers caught themselves in a bind here - both Smith and Neo have already proven that they are indestructible while in the matrix and thus cannot destroy each other physically. Then Smith seems to be hovering on the verge of existential crisis (lack of purpose) and I thought this would be cool, having his downfall rooted in the existential, rather than the physical realm. But no, we just get a series of inexplicable, blinding-white explosions. In the final scene we have characters I could care less about making cryptic comments and flinging the Sequel door wide open. So what, now there is peace? I.e. no more conflict between the machine world and humans, each just coexists? Do the machines continue to use embryonic humans to fuel their existence and the "awakened" humans are still relegated to their (now destroyed) underground lair? Seems to me the humans still get the short end of the stick...

[m]I picked up this paperback when I was short on reading material. Mysteries are one of my favorite genres and the byline on this one is "Murder in Hollywood's Heydey". I would say that it is adequately written, a rather backhanded compliment.Forgettable plot and storyline, no characters that are even interesting, much less unique or that you really care about or pull for or against.Not recommended unless you are desperate for something just to pass the time in the waiting room.

[m]The winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward. Also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins. I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon.

[m]A really great movie. Note: If you are looking for an action film, this film isn't for you. It's a serious film and you have to be in the mood for that and expect that. That said, there is some drama, and the actress is simply fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the extended interrogation scenes.Nothing like a 21-year-old girl standing up to tyranny and risking her life for what is right simply because her conscience tells her she must. May her soul be blessed.

[g]I use this with a Yard Butler Deep Root Irrigator (available on Amazon). My prior root feeders had an attached system for the fertilizer pellets but the Yard Butler did not. This unit does have a built-in backflow valve and I didn't need that, but I've wondered if it might have been part of the challenge I had in getting this to work. The instructions say to put the tube in a bucket and turn the water on full blast. I did this but it didn't work. I finally removed the spring end piece (used for weight and, I assume, some filtering) and noticed if I held my finger on the tube and turned the water on fully there was a surge of suction, then nothing. Then I discovered if I turned the water on slowly until I felt the suction and stopped at that point it continued to pull mixture from the bucket. Again, if I turned the water on fully it did not work.The nice thing is, where you need to replace "pellets" in other feeders after 5 or 10 minutes, this system ran for an hour before it used up the entire 2 gallon mixture.The threads are very sharp on this nicely machined piece of brass so watch your fingers.

[m]I ordered both and have posted my pictures for reference above. The PikStik has a larger capacity to pick up items, as you can tell from the photo. It is slightly shorter than the Ettore. Both have heads that rotate. The pickup part is configured differently on each one. The PikStik is more of a "flat" system, like keeping your hands straight and clapping. The Ettore has a bit more of an edge that is more like cupping your hands slightly and clapping. It seemed to me the Ettore picked up a coin lying flat on a table just a little more easily than the PikStik, but both performed the same when the coin was on a carpet. If you need the larger capacity, then the PikStik is your choice. If you need the extra two inch reach, then the Ettore 50 inch is your choice. If neither of those is a factor, you can choose whichever looks best to you or is least expensive at the time of your purchase. You'll be happy with either one.

[g]Other reviews relate this game to a really scary horror movie. I agree. This game scared the living weasel out of me more than any movie could.But when I go out to buy a game, I'm not really looking for something that's gonna scare me. I want a game that's fun. And SS2 just didn't cut it.Awkward play control (especially when fighting), lousy attempt at techno music, bad graphics. It's not enough RPG to be an RPG, and at the same time, not enough of an FPS to be an FPS.Bottom Line: You wanna be scared witless? Read a good book or watch a horror movie. Wanna have a lot of fun? Buy Unreal.

[g]Got one of these from Target years ago. Loved it, so a week later I purchase 2 more.Over the years, I've dropped them, washed them so often in the dishwasher & generally abused them that each vessel is looking rather ragged.I started to get worried when I couldn't find replacements anywhere and I didn't know how to search for them on the Web because there isn't any branding on the vessel nor the screw top lid - no branding, NO WHERE! ZOMG - I was starting to freak out.Then the wife saw a smaller version at a grocery store and purchased it. I entered the product info into my Amazon app on my Android phone and BAM! Two days later ... Drinking joy.I love it - every sip is like the bottle busts awesome unicorn gism into my mouth to the point of swelling my cheeks as I suck with ever increasing intensity and swallow - I freaking love this freaking hydration bottle.===================WHY I LOVE IT===================Why do I love these?First off - I work around a lot of tech equipment and a spilled drink would be a disaster. I think of these as "big boy" sippy cups. At work I sometimes have to fix laptops and computers that get spilled on. You'd be amazed at all the different kinds of people that spill drinks on their computers - executives, warehouse workers and every body in between. No level of success keeps people from being knocking over drinks. It is hard to meet someone that tells the truth and hasn't yet knocked over a drink on someone's computer.I don't spill - my big boy sippy cups knock over - and liquid comes out, but only tiny amounts and if you are quick, not even a swallow of drink escapes. SAVES THE DAY every time.Another huge reason - I want a clean, sterile non-disposable beverage vessel. I want a straw like experience whilst I sip - but I also want to be able to break the thing down so that I can properly wash it in the dishwasher (even though the instructions tell you not to - I put all pieces on the dishwasher's top rack and even run anti-bacterial mode.)Another top feature: It doesn't sweat even on the hottest most humid days.======================================Things that may annoy some======================================After a year or so of heavy use (meaning lots of washes in the dishwasher - nearly nightly washes) the adhesive that keeps the inner "sleeve" in place will loosen and slide out of the outer insulating barrier.Why might this annoy?+ Well, unless you glue it back, it doesn't stay together when lifted.+ Since the air tight seal is broken, things sweat a little (or a lot depending on how bad you end up cracking the outer thermal sleeve.)This may not happen to you - like I said - I had been rough on my first ones. I've ridden them like the little dirty drink donkeys that they are. And despite the abuse - they've been useful for YEARS.The other thing is that if you close the lid, leave a cold drink in a hot car (for even 20 minutes) and do not open VERY slowly - it will shoot beverage all in your face (LOL) - beverage facial FTW!I freaking love these things. Thought about hording some in case the company goes out of business or discontinues the line.

[g]This is drivel of the first degree, a political agenda thinly disguised (and not very cleverly) as something worthwhile with which to indoctrinate teachers and eventually children, with the author's liberal political bias. That it is recommended to teachers is beyond astounding, especially if they are paid and employed to teach in the United States and have any professed understanding of what their native country represents in the world community. This tome does not even represent a fine line between propaganda and education - it tramples any such finesse with the author's blatant leftist opinions.

[m]I tried this antenna to see if it would improve my reception of a couple of HD channels which my Sharp Aquos would not tune. Unfortunately, it turned out that the reception was actually worse with this antenna than with the old-school UHF antenna which I inherited with me house.My impression of the Terk antenna is that it looks nice but feels a bit cheap. (It is extremely lightweight.) Installation was a breeze and there are tons of options to choose from in terms of mounting locations.The return process was easy--as always with Amazon. Someone said you can't close the sides of the antenna once you open them, but this is not true. If you look close to the hinge point you will see the word "PUSH". If you push there, it will release the arms and allow them to be closed.I ended up getting those missing channels by purchasing a Motorola signal amplifier. You can find that on Amazon too and it is amazing. I'm cancelling my cable at the end of the month!!!

[m]Clara, Jennie and Leonie Jerome are 3 sisters born of privilege in America between 1851 and 1859. They all marry British men and all suffer the ups and downs of uncertain fortunes. Jennie marries into the Churchill family and is mother to Winston. Her husband dies of syphilis and she will marry twice more and have countless affairs. Leslie marries into the wealth Irish Leslie family and bears 4 sons. Clara marries (for love) Moreton Frewen who never succeeds in any of his business ideas.I get that these were important people, but I could have done without the laundry-list name-dropping in every chapter. The book was over 400 pages, but could have been half the size, just as informative and twice as entertaining. I struggled with the last third of the book because there was no development of the women there. Plus, how many more money conversions (of that time to present day value) can one person take?

[g]Samantha Joyce is 26 and the healthcare advisor to a Senator from her home state of Ohio. She is lovingly naive, clumsy and makes embarrassing mistakes. She end-up dating a rival senator's speech writer who cheats on her. She sends a sexy message via e-mail but hits "reply all" and ends up the subject of a Post article. She winds-up on the road when her senator is tapped for the VP spot and witnesses her ex's downfall firsthand. She eventually is in the White House with her (now VP) boss, a new boyfriend (the Post reporter) and manages to send one more mortifying e-mail (saying "pubic" instead of "public") before the story ends.When I grabbed this book, I didn't realize it was Al Gore's daughter who wrote it. Then, it became really obvious when the book went into policy discussions. The story - getting beyond any subliminal messages - is great. Sam is a realistic character and has real life experiences. The political aspect is interesting and has an inside feel without getting boringly technical. Some of the language seemed forced - as if Kristen wanted you to really know she went to Harvard - but she certainly wrote about what she knew and RG was not a carbon-copy of her dad!

[m]This should be required viewing in public schools across America, because so many of our young people aren't aware of the struggles, brutalities, and often-times murders African-Americans suffered trying to get to the promised land. Through the beginning in 1955, with the murder of Emit Till we see how African-American withstood oppression and racial injustice, struggling for a right that they'd earned through wars, labor, and citizenship since the first slaves landed in Jamestown.

[m]In his study Something Happened: A political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies, historian Edward Berkowitz attempts to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the 1970s. While other writers have dismissed the decade as a relatively chaotic interlude between the radical 1960s and Reaganite 1980s, he attempts to reconstruct the decade as an important and meaningful period in American history. He attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the political, cultural, economic and social events and developments of that decade. Unfortunately, he has no underlying argument or theme with which to bring together his large body of material and, as a result, the reader is given a series of chapters on economics, politics, etc that seem to have little connection among them. While the reader is given a lot of facts, the book attempts to make no large-scale interpretation or assessment of the decade as a whole.However even in giving the facts, much of the coverage is rather superficial. Much of the material is taken from secondary sources. Also the are some major errors (Nixon announced his resignation from office in August, not April. Pg. 30) and some minor ones (Seattle passed its gay rights law in 1973, not 1978. Pg 153. Voers defeated a referendum measure to repeal it in 1978.). That decade stills awaits an historian to give the definitive assessment of its place in American history.

[m]After reading David Walker Howe's excellent "What God Has Wrought: The Transformation of America, 18-15-1848" I begin looking at the other books in the Oxford History of the United States series. I saw David Kennedy's "Freedom from Fear" and assumed that it would be as well-written, broad and interesting as Howe's book. Big mistake!In spite of its subtitle "The American People in Depression and War: 1929-1945" Kennedy's book is mainly a history of the Roosevelt administration, its policies, and politics and a military history of World War II. As far as a history of the American people, there is very little of the social or cultural history that made Howe's book so interesting.As far as the political and military history of the Roosevelt administration, the writing is tedious, although I really don't find Kennedy to be overly biased one way or another.Overall a disappointment.

[m]An objective study guide to questions often asked about the Roman Catholic Church from those outside the church. It is a help in understanding what the Church truly teaches about its signs, sacraments, symbols and saints. It does not have a sectarian ax to grind, and leaves the reader with a choice to make after discovering the evidence presented. Its content may lead the reader to deeper investigation into the Catholic faith.

[m]I had been using these for several years and finally had to give them up. As a previous reviewer stated the ear cups are pealing and leaving little black specs everywhere. Besides one can't wear these for more than an hour without them feeling uncomfortable. The cord has held up well for the several years though.

[m]This used to be my favorite magazine. I have been a subscriber for years. Unfortunately since Bloomberg bought it has gone straight down hill. It is becoming more and more of a political magazine and less and less dealing with business. The political comment is strictly liberal.When my subscription expires I will not be renewing. The bottom line is if you like liberal politics then this is the magazine for you. If you want business coverage you will need to look elsewhere.

[m]I'm in general agreement with other reviews, with one major addition.Comfort is not exceptional. I've used these on a transatlantic flight, and I could only stand to wear them about four hours. My ears became too sore after that. I had some Seinheisers before that did not have that problem.Sound quality is marginal, but it's about what I'd expect from noise cancellation headphones in this price range. Ditto for the noise cancellation. The set folds up pretty well, but not nearly as nicely as expensive sets such as Bose.In short, there are no outstanding reasons to buy this set. But there's one reason that makes wish I had not. I'm tired of putting those silly ear pads back on.The first one fell off the third or fourth time I used the headphones. I worked hard to try and get it back on exactly right. Then the other side fell off shortly thereafter. Now they both fall off with regularity. I'm way past trying to get them back on with the edges property tucked in because it's not worth the fifteen minutes it takes every time. Now I just slip them on, and know that they'll fall off again in two or three wearings.I'm thinking of super-gluing those pesky suckers on. I think that's the only way they might stay for a while.

[m]I have been using this keyboard on three computers for about three years now. I find it perhaps the best I've ever used in terms of ergonomics and feel.As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is "F Lock Key Eliminator".The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.All in all, this is a pretty cheap way to find out if you like ergonomic keyboards.

[m]The bane of cooking pancakes, crepes, grilled cheese and such is uneven heat. I was astounded the first time I cooked grilled cheese with this pan. I'd never seen such even browning, even with less butter than I normally use.It's also pretty durable. I normally use non-metallic implements, but I've used metal turners several times with no problem.It's easy to wash. The non-stick works well, and it has no places for tough-to-get food to stick.I even use this for bacon and eggs, though it takes special care not to have something fall outside the pan because of the shallow sides. As you might expect, it cooks bacon very evenly. It's also ideal for omelets because of both the even cooking and the shallow sides which make flipping the omelet easier.

[m]I've been using this unit for over a year during technical classes. I have two laptops that I must use, and this switch allows them to both be connected to the projector. Instead of moving the one projector cable when I need to switch, I can just flip the switch on this box.I have had no trouble with the signal. However, this isn't a premium product, and it shows. The switch has become a bit loose. I have to wiggle it to get it to engage the B position. Also, the screws on the VGA ports were not as tight as they should have been. One came loose, and I had to open up the unit to fetch it from the inside of the box and reattach it.So call it three and a half stars. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and bumped to four stars because it's pretty cheap. I don't really expect premium construction on such a product.As another reviewer noted, you need three cables for this thing to work. However, whatever projector you use will probably account for one of them, so I travel with two cables for this box, one for each laptop connected to the A and B ports.Do be careful with it. The edges and corners are a bit sharper than you might expect. Not enough to be really dangerous, but I would not want to swipe my hand against it accidentally.

[g]Many of us -- certainly myself -- wistfully think from time to time, "I should be a writer." I'm not sure exactly what solace to take from finding that Michael Crichton -- a hugely successful writer -- seems wistfully to think, "I should be a scientist."This is a Bad book, with a capital 'B.' It is truly shameful. Mr. Crichton has an appendix to his book called, "Why Politicized Science is Dangerous." Right -- it is better that we should completely skip the science and go straight to the politics, as Mr. Crichton has done in this book."State of Fear" closely resembles another propanda work (and Bad book), "Atlas Shrugged," by Ayn Rand. It has the same pubescent affinity for the ironic, the iconclastic, while in truth seeking out no more than acceptance and appreciation. Michael Crichton wants you to like him, though for being a thoughtful and thorough intellect, and not for being a hack novelist.But Michael Crichton is not a thoughtful and thorough intellect; he IS a hack novelist.It was almost physically painful for me to read the section where super-professor and secret agent John Kenner -- Crichton's John Gault; I wonder if he was not involved in the romantic threads of the novel as a matter of Crichton's jealousy of his female characters -- lectured (lectured!) some poor sap (it doesn't matter whom) on the unforgivability of climate scientists having missed a predicted temperature change by 300%, comparing it to a commercial airline or moonshot flight lasting longer than scheduled. Hello?!Predicting the temperature of the atmosphere of a planet is essentially a problem of first predicting the total heat energy of the planet, and then predicting its disposition within the ground, the seas, and the atmosphere. This is not a simple matter of being unable perfectly to predict prevailing winds, as in Crichton/Kenner's stupid comparisons. A much more appropriate example would be comparing a temperature change prediction with a prediction of the change in flight times of a particular commercial flight or a particular moonshot between now and ten years in the future, reflecting both technological advancements and the uncertain weather affecting the flight. If we predicted that the flights would be an hour shorter, and they ended up being only twenty minutes shorter, would we question our premise of tecnological advancement increasing flight speeds? And yet Crichton suggests that by missing THE CHANGE in temperature by 300%, climate predition has shown itself to be worthless. Among sensible people, it should be held as profoundly impressive that the total energy of the earth system could be predicted to within what is likely a very small fraction of 1%. And this is why scientists, and not hack novelists, should be refered to for opinions on scientific matters.Aside from having no clue how to interpret numbers, what I think is the most shameful thing about this awful novel and Crichton's apparent personality disorder comes late in the book, when he has a Solomon Island rebel group engaging in cannibalism. Yes, that word was 'cannibalism.'Again, some sort of late adolescence seems to have directed Crichton from a reasonable rejection of the Rousseau-an concept of the nobel savage to a reprehensible adoption of a pre-modern concept of primitive societies as lacking even the most basic tenets of morality. Crichton points to the protective, uplifting aspects of modern culture, but then he abandons them: an accusation of cannibalism is about the most ham-handed of all pre-modern slurs underpinning racism and other notions of superiority.Let me be clear on this: there has been cannibalism in human history. However, it has by all accounts always occurred very much with full recognition of the power of all that it suggests -- the actual cannibals of history ate other humans not because they did not respect the magnificence of humanity, but precisely because they DID respect the magnificence of humanity. But for Crichton, cannibalism is just a trip to a food buffet, plus unimaginable cruelty.So this is Michael Crichton's latest book: a hackneyed effort at science-ism, cloaked in the 'manly' quality of rebellion and iconclasm (although where is this mythical land where 'everyone knows' that global warming is happening? And who is the President on that planet?), and infused with a desire to be liked for the 'right' reasons. Michael, Michael -- there are some people in the world whom you should NOT want to like you.

[m]Like others, I'd like to put a disclaimer up front that BioWare seems like a good company and the people there seem to care about their product.Atari, on the other hand, clearly does not. I am one of the many people who are unable to use this game with my cd drive. I tried everything under the sun (checked that drivers were current, updated firmware, etc.). There is no fix for this on the BioWare or Atari site (as of 7/25/03). I emailed Atari's tech support (after going through their troubleshooting maze) TWO WEEKS AGO and I have received NO RESPONSE.As some(probably most) people's cd drives work with the SecuRom, one could say that it is MY problem that it doesn't work and I should just go out and buy another cd drive so I can play this game.The question is, "Do you want to gamble with your time and money?"Alternate Review:This game is great. Unlike the previous NWN, this expansion revolves around the exciting world of computer troubleshooting and technical support. You play an unwitting dupe of the Atari game distribution company who has been suckered into buying a game that won't run on your computer despite the fact that your system meets the requirements printed on the packaging and that there was no disclosure of the known hardware incompatibility issues. Your pulse will race as you search for new drivers. Your heart will pound as you update the firmware for your cd drive. Will the firmware work? Or will this be the end of your drive? On-line play is great to, as you post to discussion threads and share your frustration with other "users". The high level of realism makes this title "one not to miss".

[m]I used these with kiln-dried 2x12 from Home Depot. I suggest you be patient and look for light-weight, well dried lumber. It will make it easier for you to handle. Pressure treated boards will be quite heavy after you've added the end pieces.For easier handling, you may want to cut 1" x 5" handle holes near the center of the boards (leave 1-1/2" of material on the outer edge). I say near the center because you should temporarily afix the end pieces on the lumber first and then determine the true center based on weight. Then you can cut your handle holes. Otherwise, the boards will not be balanced when carrying them.If this doesn't make sense, just cut the handle holes about 1" from board center toward the heavier end piece - that should take care of the weight balance. You may want to sand the handle hole edges for a smooth handle finish.

[m]This is the second Cuisinart coffee brewer I purchased. Some years ago I purchased a Cuisinart and it lasted and made the best coffee we ever tasted. I've tried them all, literally. You can spend more money but why when you can make the best and the hottest coffee for less. As much as we use this, it's endurance and consistancy in flavor, heat retention and durablility beats the rest at any price. It comes in an attractive black no finger print container, and can be programmed for having coffee any time. It shuts itself off so no worries. This was also rated by Consumers Best Buy for 2009 (again). The ony thing I would change is it's water tank has no way to let you know how much water is in the container as there is no window for viewing water once you put in it. Other then this small issue ( I measure it with a measuring cup), it's the best coffee pot I ever had and in the future if it wears out, I'll buy it again. It has a one year warrenty, but last me 5 with continuous use daily.

[g]Interesting how those that preach tolerance for others, don't exactly practice what they &quot;preach&quot; Sorry if you are offended by the word preach, it is in no way endorsing or forcing my right wing christian beliefs on you. I just wanted to point out that &quot;A reader from New Hampshire&quot;, A reader from Washington DC&quot;, &quot;A Reader from Maryland&quot;, and Carolyn left some pretty nasty reviews. Turns out that because the name of George and Laura Bush is on the forward to the book, they won't even buy it. Of course there is the normal name calling and hate filled rhetoric that you would come to expect from left wing, intolerant socialist. You really should be ashamed for being incredibly petty and small minded, but then again, you were probably educated in government schools, so I guess we got what I paid for...

[g]Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review. Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend.The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is very misleading. One would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive. I'm a big fan of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off. I couldn't be more wrong. Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start. The entire movie is over the top starting with the actors. Everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie. She looks lost, confused, and out of her league. Other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, a "wacky" police sgt with his asthmatic partner, the bait & tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest.The movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere. When meteors strike the earth (and slam into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies. Our main characters all meet up and try to survive. However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle. The viewer is left to wonder what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by. I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more. Bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst camera work i've ever seen. This movie apparently took two years to make... imagine if they only had one???Another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait & tackle charater. He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his eyes to boot). Then, he walks away. When he appears again, he's able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his "spurs" into the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands. Does this guy ever miss? What do you think? He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down. Not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia!If you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the top. I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half. Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head. I personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter. Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don't get it.The absolutely worst part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music. It never stops! There's never a scene without music for some reason! And it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy! It reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing. The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with extra cheese included. Did they use up their budget on the effects? Probably! I found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film!If you're a fan of good monster / zombie movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving. It doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is... well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours back. I know i do!!!

[m]minus the capturing of Han Solo. The book starts off with Thrawn attacking a smuggler's base using AT-AT (not a snow planet like in Empire Strikes Back). The guy gets away of course, stuff happens and Luke finds his way to the Jedi Masters new home world to learn more about the ways of the Jedi. Sounds like Yoda right? Except this Jedi is really an evil Dark Jedi clone of a long dead good Jedi. The ending was pretty interesting too with them unmasking the Stormtroopers to find a surprise.

[m]I originally bought this more on a gamble than nothing else. I had never read a single issue of Astro City and after reading this book I wash hooked. There is a much deeper feeling to this book than normal comics, probably because you don't HAVE a main character. Each issue you meet a new superhero (at first at least) and see what they are like. The first book introduces you to some of the main characters and sets up for The Confessor story line.

[m]This book contains the first story arch of Astro City. In the previous issues, it was literally issue to issue, no to be continued endings, but this has it. The first arch shows the life of a 10 year old girl who is a super hero and struggles to cope with how she is different from normal girls. The second is of Jack In The Box (the dude on the cover) and how his pregnant wife will have a child who might grow up hating his father for dying when he meets 3 people from potential futures. 2 of which were homocidal maniacs claiming to be his son.

[m]My main qualm with this book is how the author claims he is simply expressing his opinion, and says that each person is entitled to his opinion, however he will then slam you in the face (figuratevly speaking, did I spell that right) that his opinions are right, and that it does not matter what others think. He never will flat out say it, but he will make it clear that he does not care about other people's opinions and that the only right person is himself.

[m]As I write this, the book is listed within the top 25 selling books on Amazon. It has close to 1300 reviews. And it was written 4 years ago.My opinion will hardly change your mind.I read this after reading De Vinci, and I am glad too. Sure this takes place before De Vinci, but after the (very minor) let down of De Vinci when it came to the end, this book was the complete opposite. To the last chapter of the book, it had be stuck on it. I enjoyed this more than De Vinci, and with good reason. The book didn't get stuck on the same repeating themes that De Vinci did. This one was more entertaining, and, albeit a less believeable story, was just plain better. It isn't so much the story itself, but the way it was written. De Vinci's story was good, but it had too many repeated themes. This one was much more original as far as themes repeating, it didn't have some of the same lines over and over. So yeah, just like read it and stuff.

[m]There are better books about him than this. While a lot of the stuff he says in the book is also in other books, it comes off twisted. And contradictive. One part of the book stands out in my mind in particular.He talks about how James Dimon and how he couldn't join the board at Citi Group. He says in the book something like "I told Jamie if he can convince the board to let him be a member then he should do so." A few pages later, maybe 2, he talks about how Dimon got onto the board after all and Weill felt betrayed he would go behind his back like that to convince the board to letting him join.That last paragraph sums up the book pretty much. Full of contradictions.

[m]You know how it is when you subscribe to a magazine and you have to click past a notice that says "You will begin receiving your periodical in six to eight weeks."? Not Concrete Wave. I subscribed last week and lo and behold this miserable rainy Monday afternoon I return home to find the latest issue (the issue that made me want to subscribe) waiting for me when I got home -- hand addressed, no less. They even included a 2011 calendar with longboarding girls on the cover (swoon!). Thanks, CW!If your wheels are 60mm or bigger, you need this magazine.

[m]Well let me start off by saying I knew most of what was in this book from experience. However if you don't want to find out the hard ways (a series of brutal atacks from &quot;bully&quot; types), then you should invest in this book. Let me explain what you will get. The first part of the book is dedicated to explaining what a &quot;Bully&quot; type personality, and woofing really is. The &quot;Interview&quot; as it is called is peyton word for the intial verbal bashing the Bully type gives you before an attack. Quinn also explains that the &quot;interview&quot; is the process the bully takes to select a victim. Quinn goes indepth by explaining in a straight forward amnner that Bullies aren't looking for what your thinking, but instead looking for a sense of power over another person. Made since to me. It also explained why every smuck in North Carolina had to waste my valueable time picking a fight with me, and why when I made it clear they were going to have to put some work into beating me down then they retreated. Quinn expands on thes thoughts with the effectiveness of senario based training. Quinn explains how senario based training can indoctrinate an indivual in as little as a weeks time. At some points, unfortunaly, it sounds like he is just advertiseing for RMCAT, or it is some kind of manifesto. Still the book was of great value since it explained in frank english the truth about fighting. Most of the self defense books I hve seen only showed me techniques, some were more effective techniques than other. However, in stressfull situations the techniques did me no good. This book explained to me what I actually needed to make those techniques effective. I need to control myself. The battle is decided before the first two sword ever cross.

[m]I've enjoyed an Orange Pekoe and Black Tea blend for years. About eight years ago, I was introduced to an Indonesian brand that was a blend of Orange Pekoe, Black Tea, and Cinnamon. It was incredible! However, it was bought at a discount store and I was never able to purchase it retail - despite my dogged attempts. Ever since, I have been forced to go from one imitator to another looking for a replacement.Enter Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice which I first purchased at a specialty store that carried somewhat exotic products and have since purchased on Amazon.com. What can I say other than WOW!!!! This tea has such an INCREDIBLE taste. It is almost indescribable how beautifully the black tea mixes with the cinnamon and orange in your tea cup. I love the cinnamon taste so much, I actually OVER steep my tea bag in order to infuse as much of the powerful cinnamon taste as possible. I'm sure many tea enthusiasts in the UK and here in the US would be aghast at the thought of over-steeping tea as normally you would be left with a strongly bitter cup as the black tea would infuse too much of its taste into the water. However, this does not happen with Harney & Sons. Instead, the only thing you get is a stronger and stronger cinnamon & orange taste. I steep my tea so long that I often have to reheat my cup, but it is so utterly delicious (that would be the basking in fields of flowers with rainbows and unicorns kind of delicious) that I'm willing to wait another minute or two. Add a little sweetener and a touch of cream and its TO DIE FOR!!!As you can see, I can't say enough good things about either Harney & Sons teas in general or the Hot Cinnamon Spice blend in particular. I was so happy to find this tea - it truly blows away any brand that I've found - one of the many instances where you win when you pay for quality!

[m]I love the form factor -- it looks great sitting under the Mini -- but in practice it has been mostly just a source of frustration. I have a chain of self-powered Firewire hard drives which simply would not come up when plugged into this hub, but mounted just fine when plugged directly into the Mini. In addition, it does create quite a mess of cables behind the Mini, exposing only one port of each type on front where you really want them. This is a purchase I regret.In fairness, the USB portion of the hub does seem to work a bit better. So if you only need a USB hub, this might be OK, but I wouldn't recommend it for Firewire.

[g]This valet stand is nice - i put my wallet and change on top and use the mirror (which pivots up and down) to adjust my tie or comb my hair. Just be careful when you are putting it together - the two side boards fit either way so at the end it was backwards and I had to undo everything and do it all again (which took an extra 10 minutes). No biggie but be careful and you will save the extra 10 minutes I wasted. Otherwise the stand looks nice - nice wood. Doesn't look cheap at all, despite the price.

[m]This watch gets a lot of compliments. When I opened it I was a bit put off by what looks like a "plastic band." The band, however, is Copperhead snake! It didn't seem so plastic after I saw that! My only complaint is that the hands are pretty thin and it's a bit hard to accurately read the time since they don't contrast terribly well with the workings of the watch. Or it could be my eyes are getting old. All in all, a very nifty watch.

[m]While he may have a nice command of the English language, and certainly shows talent in his imaginitive descriptions, this book is not about the Kalahari Bushmen. It's like the author needed a topic, and chose the bushman, so he could have a legitimate vessel to spew his philosophies and insights into the world. Does he truly care about the bushman? Half the book's story felt like it was just an excuse to talk about how the author is an outstanding person: fair, rational, logical, intuitive, expert marksman, friend, compassionate; then he also goes off for pages that are seemingly dedicated to demonizing one of the expedition's members, it's like Van Der Post was still holding a grudge from their trip, and somehow had to vent his anger and prove to everyone that he was "in the right".I wouldn't recommend this to someone interested in learning more about ancient cultures or the Kalahari bushmen; I also wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a book about adventure. While I'm not unhappy I read this book, I do feel like I could have read something with more substance. What I gained from this book is the experience of having read something I truly didn't care for. You know how people talk about not being able to put a book down? I had a hard time picking this one back up...There's gotta be something better on the subject. This book isn't even that memorable of a spiritual journey; the books by Carlos Castaneda, the first few in the Don Juan series -- this is what I'd recommend for a "spiritual" journey.

[g]Nietzsche was not a systematic thinker and so it is very difficult to construct a book on his difficult thought. Deleuze has, however, successfully accomplished that. A combined reading of this work and Pierre Klossowski's "Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle" would provide an understanding of Nietzsche that is well beyond what is presented in most books on the author. It is sad, but we english speakers have collectively written most of the bad literature on Nietzsche. It was the french after WWII that picked-up the mantle set forth by Nietzsche after the embarrassing abuse of his thought by the Nazis.

[m]I've always been a big Stabbing Westward fan. Ungod is an amazing industrial/rock dark album. Wither, Blister.. has it's moments. Darkest Days is excellent. My favorites sometimes switch between Ungod and DD. This self titled piece of crap is a sorry attempt at selling out and not making it. Filled with mostly soft acoustic tracks that lack any lyrical depth leave the earlier SW fans confused. I might have listened to this album once.. And to be fair I had high hopes, but I really can't imagine anyone who likes the other SW albums to get into this.

[g]Must say I have watched this show for the " entertainment " value more than anything, but with the latest release totally over it. I am not sure how dedicated the " team " is to helping people, if they are at all. It seems they love certain phrases and for people that do this sort of thing they seem VERY alarmed if they think they find something. Notice how the show is more and more of them blurting out and NOT of any real event or pick up, notice how they " see " shadows but the camera's never catch a thing, notice how there are hot spots and they seldom watch these area's, notice how short the " dead " times actually are, notice how they always do things in the dark for effect when many cases reported have daytime sightings etc.. It may also be my feeling of disappointment but in this last series there are more and more mirrors, more and more shots of Ryan looking at himself in them, surely he has earnt enough money by now to buy his own mirror or is he just vain ????? Maybe the director is possessed by mirror's or his mother was attacked by one but something is strange here and it's not the filmed vision presented which is after all, why one would buy this !

[m]InRC Series Bundle: The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Routledge Classics)philosopher of science Karl Popper tells us that the difference between science and pseudosciences lies in the power of refutability of a hypothesis. Despite its academic, governmental and impressive financial backing in the private sector, psychiatry does not rest on a body of discoveries experimentally falsifiable or refutable. In fact, the central entity in psychiatry, the concept of mental illness--say "schizophrenia"--cannot be put forward as a falsifiable or refutable hypothesis.Let us consider the claim that psychiatrists use the drugs called neuroleptics to restore the brain chemical imbalance of a schizophrenic. A Popperian would immediately ask the questions: (1) What is exactly a brain chemical imbalance? (2) How is this neurological condition recognized among those who you call schizophrenics and which lab tests are used to diagnose it? (3) Which evidence can you present to explain that the chemical imbalance of the so-called schizophrenic has been balanced--or has not been balanced--as a result of taking the neuroleptic?Before these questions the psychiatrist answers in such a way that he who is unfamiliar with the logic of scientific discovery will have great difficulties in detecting a trick. For instance, Nancy Andreasen, a president of the American Psychiatry Association, has acknowledged that there have not been found biochemical imbalances in those diagnosed with a mental illness and that there is no laboratory test that determines who is mentally ill and who is not. That is to say, Andreasen is recognizing that her profession is incapable of responding to the second and third questions above. How, then, does Andreasen and her colleagues have convinced themselves that neuroleptics restore to balance the "chemically unbalanced" brains of schizophrenics? Furthermore, why does Andreasen have stated so confidently at the beginning of the section inBrave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genomethat addresses the question of what causes schizophrenia that the disorder "is not a disease that parents cause"?Speaking in Popperian terms the answer is: by contriving a non-falsifiable or irrefutable hypothesis. In contrast to neurologists, who can demonstrate the physiopathology, histopathology or the presence of pathogen microorganisms, Andreasen and other psychiatrists recognize that they cannot demonstrate these biological markers (faulty genes or biochemical imbalances) that they postulate in the major disorders classified in the fourth edition of theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition (Text Revision), the DSM-IV. If they could do it, psychiatry as a specialty would have disappeared and its body of knowledge merged in neurological science. What psychiatrists do is to state that after almost a century of research in, for instance, schizophrenia, the medical etiology of the "disease" is still "unknown," and they claim the same of many others DSM-IV behaviors. As Thomas Szasz has observed, in real medical science physicians observe the pathological alterations in the organs, tissue and cells as well as the microbial invasions, and the naming of the disease comes only after that. Psychiatry inverts the sequence. First it baptizes a purported illness, be it schizophrenia or any other, and the existence of a biological marker is never discovered, though it is dogmatically postulated. A postulate is a proposition that is accepted without proof. Only by postulating that these disorders are basically genetic and that the environment merely plays a "triggering" role can psychiatrists justify to treat them by physical means. But if neuroses and psychoses are caused by parental abuse, to treat them with drugs, electroshock or lobotomy only "re-victimizes" the victim.In the 1930s, 40s, 50s and 60s tens of thousands of lobotomies were performed in the United States, but since the advent of neuroleptics only about two hundred chirurgical lobotomies are performed each year in the world. About 100,000 people are being electro-shocked every year in the United States alone, many against their will. North America consumes about 90 per cent of the world's Ritalin for American and Canadian children. Many parents, teachers, politicians, physicians and almost all psychiatrists believe in these "medical model" treatments for unwanted behaviors in children and teenagers.On the other hand, the "trauma model" is an expression that appears in the writings of non-biological psychiatrists such as Colin Ross. Professionals who work in the model of trauma try to understand neurosis and even psychosis as an injury to the inner self inflicted by abusive parents during their childhood. The psyche of a child is very vulnerable to persistent abuse while in the process of ego formation. Although some books of the proponents of the old existential and "schizophrenogenic" mother are still in print, today the model is best explained in the case-stories writings of survivors of both, extremely abusive parenting and biological psychiatry, such as John Modrow. In this moving and yet scholarly autobiography, John Modrow maintains that an all-out emotional attack by his parents caused a psychotic crisis in his adolescence. His refutations of biopsychiatry tenets are clearer for the causal reader than the scholarly books by the professionals themselves.Despite claims to the contrary, the trauma model of psychosis is still alive. In this century two academic books were released on the subject, but instead of mentioning them I'd recommend Modrow's fascinating approach to the same subject: the best available book to understand "schizophrenia".

[m]I've read all of the books Johansen has written in the Eve Duncan series, because I love the characters and their stories. So I was excited to see the web of 'certralness' branch out to Jane.I like that Jane is tough, and I like that I can relate with the character, for once, an author not being afraid to write a teenager who isn't an ignorant airhead, caring only about clothing and hair.But as much as I love her characters, the more I've read Johansen, I think her writing is only so-so. There are only so many time you can say 'tentatively' and 'warily." Way too many adjectives and adverbs...Stephen King warns against those, and while I don't like his stories, I respect his writing.So all in all, I'll still be buying her hardcovers...I'm a collecter like that, don't like paperbacks, only hardcovers...but I hope she learns to limit the use of her favourite words.

[m]Color atlases help you to see a lot in a concentrated period of time and this one is no exception. This book has a nice blend of illustrations to help understand the underlying pathology and copious color photos to help recognize their clinical manifestations.

[m]"A picture is worth a thousand words" certainly holds true in medicine; you can read all you want about a physical finding, but nothing clarifies better than a picture. This book has over 1300 excellent color photos of various physical findings, pathological signs, and disease markers organized into sections that correspond to the various body parts: face, mouth, arms, legs, etc. They can be perused at random or consulted by specific body part to help with a diagnosis. Atlases usually have a sparcity of text, but the author manages to squeeze in a good amount of description and related information for enhanced learning. Great for students or veteran practitioners.

[m]I read a lot of complaints about how bad this movie was. In reality I think the producers of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" are giving it the bad reviews. It has been compared to the remake of this classic and even the producers of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" sue the producers of this film for its comparison. This may be why so many people are giving this film such bad reviews.In reality this movie (in my opinion) is better than the Remake of "The Day the Earth Stood still". C Thomas Howell plays a great part and the effects are not really that bad considering this was suppose to be a B-Movie ripoff. Now a warning to some people who are easily offended -- there is some nudity in this film, but overall it is definitely worth the $6.00 most people are selling it for.

[m]I've been a fan of King Arthur since reading The Once and Future King (T.H. White) decades ago in high school, and have read many, many books both famous and obscure on the subject. As has been noted, there have been many film versions of the Matter of Britain, some definitely better than others.This year for my birthday, I decided to treat myself to this box set. I admit the first episode did alarm me a tad with the amount of bare skin and sex featured. I hoped the show wasn't going to rely extensively on these elements to tell its story. This, however, died down by Ep 2 and IMO this series got better and better as it progressed. By the last couple of eps, I was hooked entirely and severely disappointed to learn that there would be no second season!I really enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower as young Arthur, and Morgan as played by Eva Green--well, she was beyond compare. It was great to see a Morgan who was truly wicked yet whose wickedness was understandable considering her motivation and background. It may not have been right that I was rooting for her to win by the end! But to my mind, Arthur as a character (not to mention Guinevere as a character) was weakened by his involvement in the Arthur/Guinevere/Leontes triangle, which did neither Arthur nor Guinevere any favors and gave each of them a premature history of deception and infidelity long before the expected (and traditional) Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot triangle. Why dilute that dynamic with a "trial run"? I am aware that "triangles" are frequent items in modern tv drama and often done to death. But I found myself getting very impatient with this one, and now when I rewatch, I fast-forward through almost all the Arthur & Guinevere scenes. The nature of their relationship in this version dragged both of them down.I also liked the way this series hinted at Morgan's nunnery "education," mentioned by Sir Thomas Malory in the first pages of the Morte d'Arthur. Sinead Cusack's Sybil was an intriguing original character, and to those who have commented that Vivien was undeveloped, well, I'm sure the show was intending to do more with her as things progressed. It seems to be the trend more often than not lately to make Morgan the daughter rather than the step-daughter of Uther Pendragon, and, considering the way Uther is portrayed in this version, you can't blame her much for bumping him off. Igraine--well, the way she was portrayed, I came away feeling that Morgan's reaction to her (although perhaps not the murder!) was more justified than not. Igraine may have been Arthur's mother, but she seemed pretty ineffectual throughout, and her eleventh-hour claim that she'd saved Morgan's life when Uther wanted to kill her just rang sort of flat.This was also the first role I've ever genuinely enjoyed Joseph Fiennes in, even if, as my daughter said, "This Merlin isn't very 'magical,' is he?" :)At the end of the day, for me, it's All About Morgan. Kudos to Eva Green on a great & complex acting feat of being fascinatingly evil and yet sympathetic, but not too much so due to the choices she made. I'm not sure if those in charge intended her to be as sympathetic as I perceived her to be, or for the "Camelot" people besides Arthur to be so dull, but IMO the "Camelot" residents were pallid in comparison, though Leontes was an effective (largely original) character despite being pivotal in the "triangle."

[m]I'm a huge fan of Flannery O'Connor so when someone asked me to name my favourite novel I picked a little bit-of-a-book and said "Wise Blood".Partly because the characters are, if not wholly understood, at least wholly familiar. Despite growing up around an assortment of Evangelicals and Foundation types I managed for the most part to maintain a pretty superficial view of them. Things like snake handling and female oppression were odd but ordinary and because of this ordinary I never spent too much time thinking about the misguided spirituality that a lot of it sat upon. Through a glass darkly, and all that.Mostly, I'm moved to recommend Wise Blood again and again because it's such a brilliantly layered and grotesque comedy with powerful and appealing themes of integrity, the disaffected young and redemption. It's just one of those books you never really walk away from. Not really.And that's a good thing.

[m]Very effective in reducing background rumble for in-city listening. Better than some other noise-canceling 'phones in that one can still listen to the source material when the NC unit is off or its battery (2x standard AA-cells) is depleted. Also, no proprietary, non-replaceable battery.Low-frequency rumble of auto road noise is reduced to a slight whispering. Even the brappa-brapp of Harleys is reduced. Wind noise is tolerable up to moderate breezes.Biggest gripe is the noise-canceling module "line lump", which is rather heavy and has two cables coming out one end. Not convenient for belt-mounting by taller users, too heavy for the breast-pocket of shirts or jackets.

[m]Foaming feature does not work when configured & used according to instructions. If you're looking for a small-scale foam dispenser, as I was, this is not the gadget for you.

[m]After 3 1/2 years of moderate use--scarcely heavy-duty-- something went "clunk" inside during a shred-a-thon. Internal motor still turned on with papers in the slot, but no action in the metal shredding head.Opened up the case of the shredder works and found that a compound spur gear in the transmission/reducer had shattered. All the gears in the transmission are plastic, with metal gears only at the motor-coupling and shredder-head ends. No proper bearings on these cheap plastic gears, just sleeves and heavy greasing to manage friction. Over time & use the plastic became brittle and couldn't stand the load.It's regrettable that for the P-57Cs Fellowes elected to hit a price point and skimp on materials & engineering, whereas I and no doubt many buyers might gladly pay another $20 retail for real metal gears and longer life. So an otherwise perfectly good shredder is unfixable and headed to the landfill, just because of a $0.25 hunk of cheap plastic. Maybe the Cs in "P-57Cs" stands for Cheap.. er, stuff.Also, beware of placing shredder by sunny windows or under skylights: bright light shining in the slot can "blind" the optical paper detector and cause the unit to turn on. We once returned after a day out and found the shredder hot & running continuously.Finally, cat owners beware: our new 8 month old cat found a way to jump into the shreddings bin, but was unable to get out. Was looking one day for lost kitty and spied a pair of eyes peeking out of the bin port. Block it with packing tape and UNPLUG the shredder between uses.

[m]I bought this as a replacement for my lost trustySony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), thinking, "Hey, it's a Sony, should be good." Hah.First thing, the volume control thumbwheel popped off the back when I unclipped it from my waistband. I only luckily retrieved it, but lost it 3x more until the last instance it was lost forever--so no more volume control except with tweezers.Second, each button push generates a very loud BEEP in the 'phones that cannot be turned down or disabled. This is absolute murder when using noise-canceling headphones, which makes the BEEP even louder.Third, the unit has all these fussy mode switches and functions that are useless for just listening. Hard to remember how set the time and change presets. Reception is okay but susceptible to being overpowered by local stations.Thank goodness I found & bought a newSony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), and I'm back in my Happy Place again.

[g]Don't waste your time on this one. Get Ed Tufte's first two books. Wainer spends many pages regurgitating and adulating Tufte's previously published work--unfortunately with less clarity.

[m]For those considering a smaller home, this book will challenge your sense of size. Most of the featured homes are under 500 sq ft. While this may work well in urban Japan, I think most Americans would be very hard pressed to fit two people into anything under 700-800 square ft.That said, many of the design solutions are elegant with clever ideas for spatial layouts, storage, light, and movement.Brown does a very nice job illustrating each of the selected houses with a 2 page spread of photos. The photos are followed by another 2 page spread that clearly illustrates the floor plans in lovely, hand-rendered, axonometric views. Accompanying text describes the drawings and the key innovation / "big idea" of the design. The final section of the book discusses "small" design principles for specific areas of the house.I would have given this one 5 stars, but I found myself really missing an additional 2 pages of pictures for each house so that I could really understand the spaces better.

I thought Newt Gingrich had done wellwith Alternate history and its an area we all know it can be hard to pulloff and I thought he had done well with the characters especially withGettysburg. All of a sudden I felt in Never Call Retreat it seemed GeneralGrant comes in with one master plan to defeat Lee not just in one battlebut with one battle that settles the whole war. I felt that Newt Gingrichhad written himself into a corner with the first 2 books and this was theonly way he could write himsself out of it successfully. Everyone knowshow successfull how Lee was in real life and we are introduced to thisin the first book and it continues on into the second book. We don't getthis with General Grant Like a previous reviewer said with him you getomni-potent powers where everything just falls into place for Grant. I was disappointed with this book. If anything I could have seen the thirdbook having a series of inconclusive battles between Grant and Lee thathappened in real life that could have set up a fourth book that ended upat Appomatix. Not a book where it writes Grant has arrived the War is over now. Sorry General Lee but you're really a second rate general nowthat I've arrived, but that is my take.

[m]When we bandy about such familiar terms as "instinct," "innate" and "inherited behaviors" are we saying anything meaningful, or are we merely using vague catchphrases that give a false semblance of understanding? Blumberg develops his case against nativism in an incisive and cogent way, showing the extent to which research in the fields of developmental psychology, ethology and evolutionary psychology has been an imbroglio of false assumptions, nave explanations, illogic, and high sounding language, much of it lacking substance. Drawing on eye opening research in animal and human behavior, Blumberg exposes the failings of the nativists and evolutionary psychologists in their search for innate behaviors and neural modules. Blumberg takes us beyond the trappings of language to the intriguing complexity of behavior development and non-genetic modes of inheritance. He shows the falsity of simplistic causal notions such as genes being "programmed for" or "controlling" behavior. He rightly recognizes the wall of opposition he is up against, since the nativist view is a popular sell--we are enamored by easily digested explanations of how our genes determine who we are, our traits, our ability to reason, and our use of language. Contrary to what one reviewer has stated, nowhere does Blumberg suggest that natural selection cannot impact on our genes. What he demonstrates is that the processes are more involved and bidirectional than the nave conception of organisms as having genes "for" complex behaviors like, for example, a sharp memory or being a good typist. As Blumberg clearly states:"inheritance does not necessarily implicate genes, and it certainly does not imply genetic determination (unless all one means by this is that genes are somehow involved, which is trivially true of every behavioral trait)."I am sure Blumberg's ideas will fly over the heads of most nativists emotionally attached to their ideas, but his call for more stringent scientific research and analysis, and his invitation to a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the intersecting events between genes and behavior will be of interest to those who value clear thinking and good science. Every student in psychology and biology, indeed in any discipline, could benefit from this book, for it reveals how easily we can be mesmerized by ideas.

[m]I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels. Social stigmas related to accepting 'charity', the cruelty of those with money against those 'without' and the sheer STRENGTH of the human spirit when facing adversity. THis book led me to examine my own reality and realize how fortunate I am to have all that I do.

[g]I am quite impressed with this GPS. I have Honda's nav system on my 2007 Accord and this Garmin unit is just as good as the built-ins.Reasons I like this unit:1) Size - The unit is small which is great for putting it away when car is parked and unoccupied, and it's small enough to carry in a purse if desired.2) Touch screen - easy to use, quick response to commands.3) Basic - you don't have to pay for "bells and whistles" features such as Bluetooth, which is not something really required for a nav system.4) Price - what else can I say, the price of this unit is fantastic. It I can pay less than $200 for a unit that gets me from point A to B without getting lost, why do I need to spend in upwards of $400 - $800 for a "fancier" model. THIS GETS YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO and for a lot less.I give this unit 10 stars. It started up right out of the box and was ready to use in a couple minutes and then, viola!, I was on my way...It took me longer to cut my way into the plastic box that the unit is packed in. Why, why, why does this have to be such a hard thing to do. It's like opening a new dvd or cd. :)Don't waste your money on the more expensive GPS systems when this inexpensive unit accomplishes what you are truly looking for in a GPS.

[m]These work but I'm perplexed by the grossness of changing it. Ugh, what a mess. It was easy to insert, not too hard to take out but I keep wondering if it would leak when it was time to change (it did). There are a lot of positive reviews of this item and similar. I think tampons are easier though. This product may take some getting used to. It's definitely harder to deal with when traveling (which I was the first time I tried it). Not something that's easy to change in a public restroom.

[g]After using another product that didn't work quite as I needed it to, I bought the Nature's Miracle to reduce the cat urine smell from an approximately 12" x 12" strip of carpet that kitty urinated on. I pulled the carpet up and drenched the entire area, using 3/4 of the bottle and noticed a strong rubbing alcohol smell. The area was so wet it took about a week to dry, but guess what....no smell. If I put my nose up to the carpet I can still smell the urine, but it doesn't stink up the entire upstairs area of my house like it was doing before the treatment. I plan on doing 1 more treatment in hopes of completely eliminating the odor.

[m]I was looking for something safe and easy to use to kill fleas. My cats got some and they are indoor only so the fleas must have been on something I brought in the house. I didn't want to fog the whole house so I washed the cats in flea shampoo, washed the throw rugs and bedding in hot water to kill them, then sprinkled this around the edges of the mattress in the room they sleep in & I sprinkled some very lightly on top of the mattress. I made the bed with a thin mattress pad as well as clean sheets and the next day there were 3 dead fleas in the mattress pads so it worked and for now my cats are not scratching. I'll do it again every 2 weeks for the next 6 weeks to be sure the fleas didn't leave eggs that will hatch later. Sure was a quick way to take care of it all, of course, I have all natural hardwood floors in my house throughout so no carpet for the fleas to have gotten into & I don't know if this item is safe to sprinkle on carpets because if your pets lick it maybe it would make them ill but I don't know so I wouldn't try that.

[m]My 19 month old has been watching this DVD since he was 16 months old and he's always loved it. He doesn't find the beginning boring at all; he loves the people dressed as letters and shouts out "A" and "Z" everytime he sees them. Between this DVD, Here Come The ABC's from They Might Be Giants and Leapfrog's Letter Factory he has learned the entire alphabet and the phonics for each letter!

[m]This book was a bit of a departure, style-wise, and I liked they way Olivia's story was developed separately from the rest of the story line then woven in. I was a little disappointed not to see Simon and Deborah in this book, and I didn't see the deeply layered themes that I normally find in George's books. That was particularly surprising given the promise of the fire imagery. But this is still an extremely worthwhile read with some interesting plot twists.

[m]Apparently nobody else out there has thought to use the Hawaiian word for trouble in a book title, because if you type just "pilikia" into the amazon search engine, it takes you straight to this book. And this title does make good use of the word. The story is set in Hawaii, and the protagonist, Val Lyon, is a private investigator who does indeed encounter her fair share (and then some) of pilikia in a day's work.This particular pilikia begins when a lawyer from a prominent island family hires Val to find the adolescent son of his client, who is being jailed for contempt for failing to produce the boy during a messy custody battle. The mother claims that her ex-husband has abused the boy and that, although she sent him away for his safety, she doesn't know exactly who has him or where he is. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for Val, the mother lets slip the name Harriet, and the hunt is on. Before long, Val finds herself entangled in much more than the search for the missing child. For one thing, people start getting killed, and Val is almost one of them. Then she discovers that the family of the lawyer who hired her has a lot of connections (none of them very pleasant) to the case at hand. It doesn't help any that she also starts falling for her lawyer client.This is some deep pilikia that Val has to wade out of, but she does so admirably, even if she becomes terribly wounded in the process. One of the most striking things about this book is Val's character, which is complex and intriguing and very realistic. If I didn't know Mark personally, I'd swear he was a woman writing under a male pseudonym, because he has a clear understanding of female characters. The male characters are good, too, but sometimes they seem a little limited by the roles they have to play in the story.The story line is another of the book's strengths. It is suspenseful and manages to be complex without descending into the sort of confusion that happens when authors just dump cartloads of red herrings wherever they can. Just a tiny bit of what may be a spoiler, however: if you have any more than a passing interest in genetics, you will probably be a few steps ahead of Val once the clues start turning up. That doesn't detract from this great tropical thrill ride, though, and I look forward to reading more of Val's adventures. Before long, I suspect pilikia will be Val's middle name, not just her occupation.**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**

[m]Product: 5 stars (if it is the redesigned). But 1 star because you can get this item for free, so why selling it?My husband bought the Bose In-Ear Headphones less than a year ago. Though he looooves the brilliant sound of the music, he had many troubles with the silicon tips, which fall too often. Since he is a daddy of a 2 y.o. that also loves music, you can imagine how soon he lost the silicon tips included in his purchase. He even considered to glue them, as my mother actually did (successfully, as she told me), but all his pairs were already unmatched. Looking for those on Amazon site I came across with a great advise from another reviewer (in similar product), who warned on not to buy the silicon tips, because on its website Bose was sending replacements for free. He did not include the link and it was not easy to find it, but I actually found it and he was right.Bose acknowledged the poor design of these silicone tips, that's why they are correcting their mistake (if everyone do that...!). So, they do send a "Complete set of silicone ear tips (S, M and L)", well redesigned (apparently with a feature that impede the tips from falling) and by means of a free UPS 3 or 5-day delivery. Even provide a tracking number so you can trace the package. I must say that the items are well packaged.You can also register for a free "Stability enhancement accessory", as I did. My husband is very happy with his new absolutely-free accessories, and enjoying the improved features of these little things. And so is my mom: I also ordered the two items for her as well. Bose's website says that they reserve the right to limit the quantities, but as far as I am concerned, I placed two orders without a problem, the two of them for both items.[...]However, if they change this link, try these words in their web search: "complimentary" or "replacement". They'll do the job.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THEM if you have already paid for this fine product. Just exercise your right to a proper consumer attention. Bose is great providing that.

[m]this player could be the best, has lots of functions, but after a couple months, the thing started having problems such as can't play songs, or it freezes up.

[g]I really like these. I have a 8 units put together in 2 rows (holding 32 bottles), and I'm having no problem with toppling or instability, and I keep my racks pretty full of wine. As another reviewer mentioned, the bottom row of wine will end up sitting directly on your floor or counter, but that wasn't a problem for my setup. I found them easy to put together (with plenty of clips for attachment), and these take up the least amount of space of any wine rack I've seen. The only downside to them (and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) is that while I appreciate the compact size, if they were just a teeny bit bigger, I could store all types of wine in them. I have squeezed some pinot noirs in (being careful not to push off one of the attachment clips), but some pinot noirs and all champagnes are too big.

[m]David Wilkerson was a man of God. He heard from the Holy Spirit and fearlessly proclaimed God's Word against the sin and frivolousness of today's church. His book "The Jesus Person Pocket Promise Book" is a handbook of God's promises for all life's situations. Jesus said "man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the Mouth of God". If you are a person washed in the Blood of Jesus Christ, take these promises to the Throne of God and allow God to do His Work in your life IN HIS TIME. We need to learn how to rest in God's Promises. This book will definitely be a blessing to you.

[m]It has been almost 100 years since the publication of the book "The Secret Doctrine ". The ideas in this book and quite obscure and none of them has been correctly verified or confirmedIt is neither a popular nor a great book.Now the author in this book considers H.P. Blavatsky as a saint or super genius. There is a lot of details about her life . But these are only for those who strongly agree with and believe in her teachings - there are not too many.I am surprised that someone bothers to research into the life ofan obscure person hardly recognised in the world

[m]I was first introduced to the life of Mao by Edgar Snow's book 'Red Star Over China' I was greatly impressed with Mao. Then came the 1960's with the Cultural Revolution. I could not believe some of the crazy things initiated by Mao. This has been perplexing me ever since. This book is certainly a rude awakening for me. I can see that Snow's book was one-sided and highly biased. Here is finally a book written by a Chinese (I mean Chang) who grew up in China, lived through those turbulent times and did a fair amount of research in producing this book. While no one can prove the correctness and authenticities of all instances mentioned in this book, it certainly has been able to explain a lot of things that happened. Snow was genuine but he spent only a short time in Yenan and interviewed only Mao and Mao's men. Other books such as those by Ross Terill and Jerome Chen were far less detailed and authentic. I highly recommend this book

[g]First, this book is a quick and easy read. At just under 170 pages, it shouldn't take up much of anyone's time.I found on the surface, the story itself flowed very well and I easily followed the main character through his travels to the end of his journey. If nothing else, I found pleasure in reading a clear, simple adventure that takes the reader on a journey.Intermixed with this story the author uses his story to insert his religious beliefs and ideas about the nature of our world. I didn't necessarily agree with all of them, but again, I think his message was a very simple and direct one. If you follow your dream, you can't fail. I happen to believe that. No matter how hard the journey, if you believe strong enough in something, you will persevere. Even if you don't believe in the spiritual/religious ideas he presents, I think most people can respect and understand perseverence and following your own path no matter what the obstacles.I think the beauty of this book is that it hits you at multiple levels, story, personal journey, religious faith. You aren't forced to "buy" into the whole package to come away with being touched by this story.

[g]It keeps time and it is cheaper.That is what I was looking for.But the plastic 'glass' is higher than the side of the watch so if you hit it accidentally it might get scratched or broken easily.

[g]This filter is made in Thailand by Denso alongside some Toyota OEM filters.Denso branded filter has silicone ADBV but Toyota OEM filter made by Denso does not.The price difference between the two may be explained by this factor.Original filter your car came with from factory is not this filter or Toyota OEM filter, the original filter (90915-10003) is made in Japan and is not available in the US anymore. Instead Toyota dealers install 90915-YZZF2 which Toyota's new and lower quality filter made in Thailand by Denso.Denso branded filter comes in color blue, not black as shown in Amazon's product photo.I added current photos.

[m]It is smaller than OEM filter, falls into the air cleaner box, does not stay there as it should. Not made for the car it says was made for.Uneven foam gasket construction. Cardboard-like cheap paper element. Made in Mexico.

[g]The metal parts on the front side of the filter were rusted, God knows how long had this filter been waiting in warehouses before it was shipped to me.I bought it thinking that the brand was respectable and the product should be of good quality. The paper element is a kind of thin cardboard, the foam gasket is uneven, the metal parts are rusting. It was not made in the USA.I had to return the filter, and order a Denso First Time Fit filter.

[g]Thanks to the other review, I ordered these for my car.The rotors come in well-packaged 2 piece plastic tubs.I called Beck Arnley to find out where these specific rotors were made. I was told that they were made in Brazil.I did not order Brembo because my application was made in China. I try NOT to buy anything that is made in China. They do not value quality. Only thing they care about is the quantity.I hope these rotors do not rust, the previous rotors on my car were probably OE rotors and they did not have rust on the surface after so many years of use in WI winters.I also installed new Akebono ProAct ceramic pads with these rotors. Pads were made in the USA.I hope I will be satisfied with the long service life these rotors will hopefully provide me with.

[g]I ordered two of these filters. The packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box. However both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.I returned them for a refund.Metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent Toyota filters.Maybe a reason to use the bigger size.

[m]I've had these for about 15 years now and use them for my own haircuts. I love them! They stay sharp for a very, very long time and give me the edge I want. I have had them professionally sharpened about twice since I've owned them. The blades still meet precisely (some scissors warp, or the screws loosen, etc. causing the blades to "come apart"). They are still like new, but I'm putting them on my wish list in case I ever need to find them to buy them again!By the way, I would never use these for giving a child a haircut--or perhaps anyone else. They are EXTREMELY sharp, and yes, razor-edged. I know it's not recommended to cut your own hair, but hey, it's my hair. Just as a review for the scissors, I really like them. I'm sure they'd be great for quilting, too. :-)

[m]A publisher at Harvard University Press, Waters is the right person to offer this critique. He ruthlesly criticizes the coroporate, quantifying mentality that has crept into academics, destroying the authority and prestige of scholarly book publishing.The last chapter is the best to read. There are nice quotes such as "Thinking is not like watching a lightning storm but more like catching lightning bugs."Unfortunately, the book is hobbled by its own old-fashioned views. Too many books are being published, true. But Waters is part of the problem. He begins by saying that he has "an inordinate love of books." Well, so do tenure committees. At inordinate and unhealthy levels.He criticizes the academic's unwarranted garrulousness. But he doesn't realize that this worship of the book (good, bad or ugly) has origins in the West's worship of books, texts, great books and great authors, as displayed in his own comments that "works of art spring us forth into momentary glory" and that the function of the humanities is to connect us to "great works of art." Waters elsewhere makes much of his aesthetic preoccupations, but does not acknowledge how restricted his account of the aesthetic experience is. His account of aesthetic experience is a text-obsessed, cognition-oriented, book-loving version. Pure eurocentric high-culturalism.

[g]My mistake was that I believed in Rick Steve's name.This money belt seems to be decently made. However, I found one major flaw in this product. The idea is to keep your money, credit card, passport and other items hidden and protected. Yes, it will hide it and keep it prtected. But not when you get soaked or when you sweat. This nice silk money belt lacks the moisture barrier. So, what you have in the money belt will get soaked by rain or your sweat. So, get yourself a ziploc bag and then use this item.There are other products are just as good or better than this product for much less money. You can get one locally at bed, bath & beyond.

[m]This is a most remarkable piece of archival research that recreates the everyday life of a 16th-century Italian aristocrat as he and his family pursue his goal of attaining for him the rank of cardinal in the wholly worldly and corrupt Catholic Church of that era. Using an enormous trove of documents she stumbled upon in the archives of Modena, Hollingsworth brings to vivid and detailed life the world of Ippolito d' Este, one of the sons of the notorious Lucrezia Borgia and her last husband, Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara.In the hands of the wrong writer, this kind of research could be deadly dull--little more than an endless 16th-century shopping list. But in Hollingsworth's hands these "dry" documents come to life, and take the reader into the day-to-day, material world of Ippolito d'Este as no other form of research could do. This is history that takes us from politics and power-seeking all the way to the level of perfumed gloves and crystal urinals, a world of mind-boggling aristocratic affluence and luxury.The author's writing style, which some might consider a bit dull, is appropriate for her subject, in the sense that Ippolito needs no editorializing-- his documents themselves speak louder than anything the author could say about them. In any case, the writing is always competent, and often enlivened with flashes of dry British humor. Her ability to make sense of endless pages of accounts-- and to make the contents of those account books of interest to a modern reader-- is nothing short of masterful.My only criticism is that, among all the illustrations, there doesn't seem to be a single one of Ippolito himself.

[m]What a terrific book! I can hardly believe this is by the same author who wrote the totally mediocre "Ruby Ring." Apparently Haeger is much more at home in 16th-century France than in Renaissance Italy. The book is worth reading just for the gorgeous descriptions of castles, clothing and furniture!But it's much more than just a catalogue of everything the aristocrats had that the lower classes did not. The endless, complicated intrigues, betrayals and jockeying for favor and power that went on at the French court are brilliantly and absorbingly narrated. The main characters are each explored in detail, with a psychological insight not often found in historical fiction. Although I LOATHED Catherine de' Medici-- she must be one of the most vicious women who ever lived, and this is BEFORE her involvement in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of French Protestants-- Haeger makes a real attempt to show the deep unhappiness, humiliations and disappointments that lay behind Catherine's horrible and cruel behavior. The same with King Francois I's mistress, Anne d'Heilly: Haeger makes her another monster of cruelty, but also shows the insecurity of her position as the king's "favourite," and her growing desperation as the king's health fails and she realizes that her own fall is inevitable.I was not bothered at all by Henri's young age when he first becomes involved with Diane. That was an era when girls were often married off at 13 to men more than twice their age, so why shouldn't a youth of 14 have an affair with a woman more than twice HIS age? Think of Lorenzo de' Medici, who had a mistress when he was 16 (admittedly she was only 3 years, and not 16 years, his senior); presumably he had a bit of practice in previous years, no doubt with Florentine courtesans ten or more years older than him.) People were considered grown up at a much younger age in past centuries.My one complaint is that the author makes Diane de Poitiers just a bit too good to be true. In Haeger's portrayal, the woman not only preserves her beauty intact into late middle age, but also seems never to have had a single moment in her life when her behavior was less than noble and perfect. That can get wearing, especially as everyone around her, including Henri, the love of her life, has human failings and moments of weakness.

[m]A novel so wonderful I WISH I'D WRITTEN IT MYSELF! This is historical fiction at its best, with the gaps in the record filled in by an intelligent and well-informed imagination.What a tremendous amount of research must have gone into making it seem as if no research went into it at all. The novel is written in the first person by Mozart's wife Constanze, who looks back on her tumultuous years with the greatest genius in the history of music. Waldron captures Constanze's voice so convincingly that we see Mozart through her eyes, in reverse, so to speak: not the god-like musical immortal, but the flawed and all-too-mortal man. His music is far in the background; his daily life of food, sex (a LOT of sex), chamber-pots, cats, dogs, birds, horses, children, money-scrounging, endless carousing and heavy drinking is in the foreground.The Mozart of this novel is about as irresponsible a man as God ever made: incapable of holding onto his money; almost criminally negligent in his failure to support his wife and the series of children he carelessly fathered with her; a perennially unfaithful yet passionate and sexually satisfying husband; a problem drinker, a habitual liar. The calmer waters of Constanze's second marriage seem well-deserved after what she put up with while married to Mozart!

[m]A beautifully written and very insightful memoir by a woman who grew up in "the bush" in Australia and eventually become the first female president of Smith College. This volume begins in the author's childhood and ends with her decision to depart Australia forever, when she's accepted into the doctoral program in history at Harvard. She's particularly insightful about her difficult relationship with her mother, who both pushes her to achieve and tries ruthlessly to hold her back, as well in her descriptions of her own dawning feminist consciousness.The only glaring fault with this book is that the author comes dangerously close to ignoring the ghastly treatment of Australia's aboriginal population by the white settlers. In her opening chapter, which sketches Australia's modern history, she doesn't even mention the subject. I could understand why she omitted this in the early chapters about her childhood, when she was unaware of this aspect of her country's history, and in a later chapter, she does acknowledge that the white culture of Australia was predicated upon destroying and/or ignoring the native culture. But even there, her indignation is muted, despite the fact that Australian whites' history with the Aborigines makes our treatment of Native Americans and the history of slavery in the United States look almost benign! Hasn't Conway ever read Robert Hughes' history of Australia, "The Fatal Shore?"

[m]This is a powerful movie for anyone interested in history/African politics. The Last King of Scotland follows the life of a fictional Scottish man who becomes the personal doctor and adviser to Ugandan president, Idi Amin. The plot is gripping and moves quickly between action scenes and political dialogue. Forest Whitaker's performance is amazing and very frightening at times. He definitely deserved winning the Oscar for Best Actor!WARNING! It is correctly rated R for disturbing images, please take this into consideration.

[g]1. This book certainly addresses an important issue, but the approach Arrianna Huffington takes pushes the edges of over-statement and exaggeration. This may make for humorous writing as she takes shots at capitalism, but it truly undermines her credibility. I had to translate her statements because they were often heavy-handed and rarely polite. She seemed to be trying to achieve an emotional response from her readers rather than an intellectual one. It's a WWF response that avoids subtlety.2. Huffington's tactics remind me of the outraged man-hater who shouts, "All men are pigs!" However, in this book she shouts, "All corporate type are money grubbing, greedy swine!". This broad-brushed approach makes for tedious reading. Yes, she did a boat-load of research for the book, and I appreciate that, but it doesn't offset the acid-spitting outrage that she displays. She's angry. Ok, there's nothing wrong with being angry and I will admit that corporate scandal is something worthy of being angry over. However, at times I wanted to ask her to "calm down...count to ten...take a deep breath.... Relax, OK, now tell me what's wrong AND more importantly, how we should fix it."3. This leads to my next point... because Huffington complains throughout the book, there is little space devoted to constructive suggestions. That is, she offers virtually no solutions. The only thing she mentions which could be interpreted as a solution is her request that more people participate in democracy - that is, more people need to get out and vote. That's all she really offers in the book from a positive standpoint. She doesn't suggest what laws would be good to pass, or what laws would be good to get rid of, or how strong moral laws are to be created.4. Now, regarding capitalism as a whole, it would have been helpful if she spent a chapter explaining the positives and negatives of "free markets" compared to markets that are government owned and government funded. This would have provided some serious credibility and more of a scholarly approach.All of this analysis goes to say that I was sorely disappointed in the book.

[g]Hewitt suggests the blogosphere allows for the organization of dissent, which is focused, credentialed, complete, and--crucially--publicized. In short, he champions blogs as the force providing accountability to `legacy media'.Any fair-minded observer of `legacy media' would conclude not all journalism is good journalism. Of course, likewise, not all blogs are good journalism either. However, the point Hewitt makes is that, instead of a one-sided, agenda-driven media, we've been given balance through the quickness and efficiency of the blogsosphere. That is, one of the ways blogs provide benefits is through their timely response to periodic mainstream media error.Hewitt claims the `old media' is increasingly devoid of serious scholarship, and is slowly being reduced to mere polemic. The irony here is that Hewitt's communicating in one of the oldest media forms - the book. OK, to be fair, Hewitt isn't suggesting all other media forms are 'legacy', rather, he's pointing to the perviously dominate outlets more than the forms. (LA Times beware, and you too Newsweek and CBS.)In short, he suggests the blogs must be taken seriously, and they are rapidly becoming so. There are too many qualified journalists who run blogs for them not to have an enormous impact on our changing world. Finally, Hewitt claims the accountability they provide is long overdue.Has Hewitt been wrong before? Of course he has - he claimed national security was going to be far and away the primary voter issue of 2004. However, is he likely right about the increasing importance of the blogosphere, and why it's growing in influence and power? I believe so.

[m]With Polhemus being the chair of Stanford's English department, he's certainly a qualified writer. However, I wished he'd have co-author this book with an ethics professor, or an Old Testament authority, or at least someone respected in the field of religious studies - as this would have lended to the books' strength and credibility.The reason I suggest this is because the premise which the book rests on is derived from the Torah manuscript of Genesis - and with that said, I'm not convinced Polhemus treats this text fairly. I'd like to suggest why.To rightly understand what Polhemus calls the, "disreputable Bible story of father-daughter incest" a firm grasp on both the literary context and the cultural context of the event is helpful. With that said, even a plain reading of the text shows these incestual events are not merely the result of passions run astray.Lot's daughters believed themselves and their father the sole survivors of universal destruction; humankind, they thought, depended on their breaking taboo by procreating with their father. As a result, they succeed in getting their father drunk, and then fulfilling their plan to have children through him. The manuscript gives no indication that Lot initiated this event, nor does it suggest his daughters were drawn to him for any other reason than their desire for children.Polhemus places this account in the the modern context of older men desiring younger women and younger women being thirsty for the power and wealth of older men. In his words, "...in which daughters fall in love with their father's lives and older men are tempted by the intoxicating power and promise of youth".Certainly, both of these motivating factors (lust for youth and lust for power) may be true in what we observe today in society, but to derive those conclusions from this ancient text is to unnaturally reshape the story itself.

[m]First of all, because McLaren does such a superb job of cloaking his propositions in fictional dialog, it would perhaps be an oversimplification to suggest this book is merely a deconstruction of the Christian doctrine of hell. McLaren does more than this when he suggests there's a need to break down the notion of hell in order to allow people to re-imagine something better. This, he says, allows people to more fully understand God's grace. - p.106In brief McLaren asserts: Hell is a metaphor, not a reality - p.80 People suffer enough in this world for hell to be real - p.85 If hell is real then people are seen as disposable - p.83 The doctrine of hell led to the holocaust - p.83 Anyone who suggests others are going to hell cannot love them - p.83However, here's my thinking - if hell really does exist, if it's a place outside of God's goodness, love, beauty, then it seems that magnifies God's grace. That is, if the Christian has truly been 'saved' from something horrible, then the cross becomes something awesome, worthy of being held onto, and Jesus is rightly called the Savior.McLaren's further assertions are these:1. Jesus isn't concerned with our believing the right things, rather He wants actions and fruit bearing - p.121 (Isn't it possible to do the right things for the wrong reasons? If so, is right belief necessary for right action?)2. The gospel of Jesus isn't an answer to the human sin problem, rather it's God's love for the world - p.134 (If Jesus' death and suffering on the cross wasn't for our sin problem, then why did God allow Him to die?)3. Post-protestant churches see 'everything' as spiritual formation. There's nothing worth disagreeing about - p.142 (Would this include Mormon, Jehovah Witness, and Unitarian churches? Is there any doctrinal issue worth taking a stand on?)4. Justification by grace through faith isn't the gospel. The gospel is about bringing Jews and Gentiles together. (How was this accomplished if not through Jesus' death and the subsequent justification of believers?)5. The church exists to focus on the good of the world and thereby be a blessing to the world. (Does the church primarily exist as the bride of Christ, and to bring glory and pleasure to God?)In summary McLaren holds to a universalistic view that all people will be judged at the end of the world for both the good and the bad they've done. Hell is not a reality. Therefore, do the best you can in fighting for social justice and change in this world. However, that's not a Christian worldview, because that's not the gospel - rather the good news of Jesus being the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world is.Jesus alone is hope. May we seek to please Him for what He's done for us - not the other way around. And thereby remain 'earthly good' while being 'heavenly minded'.

[g]First of all, Johnson leaves little doubt that today's entertainment is more sophisticated than, say, the entertainment in the 1970s. That's a reasonable claim and he makes his points convincingly. However, other sections of the book brought questions. Allow me to explain.Is someone who is quick to absorb the visual stimulation of pop-culture a 'smart' person? It seems the intelligent person not only digests ideas, but produces them. Thinking creatively and originally is different than merely reacting to and retaining data - whether that's data from a text book, a movie, or a video game.Here's the point Johnson seems to gloss over, mental stimulation is not a virtue in itself. To build on that, is all learning (knowledge) 'good'? More specifically, is there a difference between wisdom and trivia? See, that's the huge question Johnson misses. If he proves all 'facts' are equal in their importance then his thesis becomes much stronger. However in the real world some knowledge is far less important than other knowledge.Let me use an example. Say we have two kids - aged 10. One kid can tell you the title, manufacturer, plot-line, and year of every video game ever produced. The other kid can recite the Declaration of Independence, tell you who signed it and why it's important. I'd suggest while both kids may be equally 'smart', both are not equally intelligent.Here's the point. Johnson is so focused on defending the media forms of today that he ignores the messages they send us. At the same time he uses the term 'good' in the title of his book. That's a term of value differentiation. Is he implying some things are 'good' and others are not? That's a moral distinction. If that's what he's saying, then what would be the 'bad' that could be promoted via today's media? ... a preoccupation with murder? sex? hedonism? Are those things bad? I wish he would have at least attempted to deal with the content (messages) of pop-culture.Here's the bottom line. Let's assume pop-culture is making us smarter. A different question would be, is it also making is better? Is it actually good for us? Is it building character, courage, heroism, altruism, and charity? I remain unconvined that it is.

[m]I returned these, because they were too large for me. To be fair to Zina, they were as described, and I wasn't sure they would work. The only reason I'm not rating them a 5 is that, having returned them, I don't know how long the clasp would work.I kept gold small hoops I bought at same time--very happy with them. Zina's product descriptions are exceptionally good.

[g]My husband gave me this cookbook for Christmas a few years ago. I was very disappointed after looking at a few recipes and trying a couple others. These recipes don't work.I have been cooking and baking for many many years. Just looking at the recipes I knew the amounts were wrong (wrong rising agent for the amount of acid in the recipe, wrong porportion of liquid to dry ingredients, etc.), but I tried a couple anyhow. Total flop. The muffins were garbage and the cookies didn't taste good either.I can't figure out how so many people like this book. Pick any other standard cookbook before this one!

[m]I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara

[m]I concurr with the other reviews. The vaccum lasted less the 8 months. The roller doesn't work and when using the hose (only thing that works) it emitts a burning smell.

[g]I bought this for a Christmas present for my husband, thinking my kids ages 7-18 would also enjoy a good shark movie. We couldn't scramble for the lost remote fast enough in Open Water (1) when a naked couple appeared on the screen for what seemed like forever before we finally turned off the TV, but not before seeing pubic hair. Nudity was not mentioned anywhere in this DVD's description, a serious infraction. I can't scrub those images from my kids' minds.The story was ok, albeit somewhat boring, until the end, which offered no satisfactory ending. I know this is a true story, but to be good, the couple's deaths should have been framed inside another person's story--coworkers, relatives, friends, etc,--to show how living people were impacted by their deaths and give the viewer some sort of payoff for watching.The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because I appreciated the effective clean camerawork and I didn't feel like I was watching a low budget film, and there are two movies on this disc for the price of one. I have not yet viewed Open Water 2, but even if fantastic, it would not up my rating of this movie set because of the significant problems with the first movie.

[m]Pure New Orleans -- these songs are obviously well loved and carefully selected. The originals stand up to the standards, particularly where "Yes We Can Can" follows "All These People," which I downloaded as soon as it hit iTunes last year. Nobody has expressed his anger at the post-storm pathos more elegantly than Harry, and no one has proved a more passionate advocate for the city and its people. Vive la Nouvelle Orleans! I want to be eating gumbo and etouffee and shrimp salad somewhere between Magazine and St. Charles every time I hear these songs!

[m]I have to say that this is a great book for anyone who has just purchased their first home. If you are in a position where you have noone to depend on but yourself, get a copy. Although, a reviewer did pan the book, stating that it gave instructions on how to change a bulb, this is not the whole truth-the bulb that they are referring to in the book, is in your gas or electric oven-big difference. It gives details on how to ignite a pilot light on a water heater safely-( which, unfortunately, I have had to do twice )- and several other things that you may not even think about until it is too late. Better to buy the book, and familiarize yourself. Do you know how to shut off your gas supply in an emergency, or repair a leaking water tank on a Sunday, or worse, in the middle of the night? Where is your toolbox? Do you even have a tool box? I admit, I did'nt even consider these things before. Buying a house for the first time, most of us are knee deep in carpet samples, decorating books, and paint chips-and most of us don't focus on gas leaks, frozen pipes, broken toilets, clogged showers, or loss of hot water. Like a good scout, BE PREPARED!

[m]This book was a shocking revelation to me. I have not spent much time listening to many of the prosperity preachers on the Pink-Haired Lady Network, but their popularity is undeniable. What little bit of time I have spent listening to them usually "sounds" good. It is deceptive, but their constant asking for money to "plant a seed" always gave me concern, along with some of their claimed miracles. Many good people are being led astray by these people.The book is a bit dry at times and repetitive in places; otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth reading.

[m]I'm a lawyer that is sometimes faced with cleaning up the messes that others have made with their entities. It seems that so many people fill out the form to organize the LLC at the Secretary of State or hire an online service provider to do it and then they are completely clueless as to what comes next. This book will guide you through the process of "what comes next." Going the do-it-yourself (DIY) route is not without risks, even when organizing the LLC. Sometimes, lawyers will organize the LLC, spend a few minutes instructing the client on what comes next and then the client is left to sink or swim. This book allows you to swim. If you follow the instructions in the book, you will likely have a stronger liability protection than 90% of the existing LLCs because most of them operate far too informally to maximize their liability protection. Yes, some of the formalities may be overkill, but if things go badly and you get sued, you will be thankful for the overkill.No, this book does not give a lot of tax advice, as some have commented. Tax advice changes too frequently and often requires a deep understanding of complex facts, particularly in an LLC context. LLC's can be taxed as an individual (i.e., "disregarded entity"), a partnership, a corporation, or an s-corporation. Because there are so many ways that LLCs can be taxed, addressing all of the tax issues in a single book would be impossible.

[g]The product seems to work well for squirrels and deer. I tried it for raccoons and it does not seem to work for them, as they continue to enter the area under my porch. Of course, the product wasn't advertised for raccoons, but I thought I would give it a shot. My review does not reflect the raccoon failure for this reason. The battery operated sprayer is a nice touch, but I wish it would reach further, as I need to spray it under my eaves to keep squirrels out. This product does not smell bad to humans, which is a definite plus.

[m]So this is try three for me on reading about different ways to deal with alcohol and drug addictions. I have read AA literature and a book on moderation and now here is "The Cure". While I never felt that this book was written to be a scam or an ad the only really good part is the chapter written by Chris Prentiss's son, Pax. His chapter on addiction beats any story in the AA Big Book. It is very long so it made the book actually somewhat worthwhile. I also found humor in the idea of hiring a Chinese Medicine doctor, seeing a psych at least three days a week, and all the other professionals I am supposed to assemble for my recovery dream team. No, this book is not a viable answer for most people. However, it is an interesting to take that we abuse substances because of something that happened to us in the past and once we work through it we will have no desire to ever use again. I can't imagine that Pax realizing and confessing that he never felt as good as his dad helped him never want to do heroin again! I would recommend other reading on this subject.

[m]This is really not a true crime book per se in that no one is really sure what happened to all these missing Canadian prostitutes in Vancouver. The amazing author presents several possibilities but the main thrust of the book is spent chronicling the hardscrabble lives of several of the missing women. I can't say I "enjoyed" reading their personal stories as so many of these women were abused as children, pregnant teens multiple times over, and continuously struggled with hard drug addictions. When some of them tried to reach out for help they were often turned away by doctors and other resources. One missing woman was actually told by a doctor shortly before she disappeared that she wasn't "doing enough heroin" to qualify for methadone treatment. If you have any interest in the plight of the homeless, or just those who have made some poor choices and could use some understanding you will likely get something out of this book. The pictures were done by professional photographer Lincoln Clarke and are haunting.

[g]***This review is full of hilarious spoilers, be advised!***There is something about a film so bad it makes you laugh, mostly that it probably isn't worth watching and it certainly is not worth buying for more than $5. Frozen is in that category, it's so incredibly ridiculous that you're left wondering why you sat through to the end and yet your stomach hurts from laughing.The film has a simple plot: three college students are stuck on a ski lift after they beg the operator for one last run down the mountain. Why? Well, the girlfriend wasn't supposed to tag along and crashed the fun "Guy Weekend" and now feeling guilty they're headed out to try and salvage a day of dealing with the Bunny Hill.I really wanted to like this movie; I found the entire concept to be really great: stuck alone on a ski lift in freezing temperatures knowing that if you can just hang on a few more days someone will be there to rescue you. This is one of those stories that could hypothetically happen to anyone, and that's what makes it so chilling. Instead of going for that creepy feeling of loneliness and playing it to the hilt we're met with the idiotic antics of children.Now, you can say that young adults really are pretty daft in certain situations, so are adults. No one is as stupid as these characters. Jumping off a ski lift without first hanging down from the bars to give you that extra drop of height, jumping feet first, jumping at all when you know it's too high in the first place? Not army crawling over the wire toward the ladder so that you can climb to safety, the ladder you must know is there because you've been skiing your entire life and using lifts? Not huddling together for warmth? Not zipping your jackets up over your face and ears when you know you're getting frostbite? Taking off your equipment and throwing it at wolves? Wrapping your bare hand around a metal bar and somehow managing to fall asleep like that? Peeing in your own snowsuit because you can't be bothered to ask someone to help hold you while you lean over the side of the lift or at least hiking it up / down and peeing through the bars?Those are just a few of the stellar moments and really they'd be excusable if we aren't presented with the knowledge that the two boys know how to ski / snowboard well enough to go on the hardest of trails and have a lifetime of knowledge about being on a mountain in the snow. Actually no, throwing things that help keep you warm at wolves far below you thinking that will scare them off is not excusable no matter how distraught you are....Which brings me to the title of this review: the multicultural wolf pack; was it that hard to actually find a proper pack of wolves? Is it too difficult to present these animals appropriately? Or was it not fitting because wolves would never (unless rabid) act the way they do in Frozen? Seriously, you want me to stomach that wolves are going to go and eat a guy without stalking and harrying him to death. Then you want me to believe they just hung around and waited so that they could within a 15-24 hour period eat another entire human being? A bear would wait; a bear would -if hungry enough- have stalked them and eaten more than one full grown human being in a 15-24 hour period. A bear, even though it would have been hibernation season, would have made a lot more sense than a mixed pack of timber and gray wolves on a human eating binge.The characters are trite, but they're also very good portrayals of the surface level of a young adult's personality and character flaws. I could have overlooked a lot of the movie had it ended before the second wolfing (ha!) down of a character and they just froze to death and were found when the resort opened back up. That would have been really quite fantastic. Instead our intrepid fools figure out when they should be dehydrated and going through serious pangs and weakness from hunger, how to army crawl over a wire. Then he is eaten. Now we're left with the girl, who is vapid, who manages to escape to the road. I was hopeful at that point, "Please let her die right here, let her succumb, it will make her managing to shimmy on her belly past the whacky wolves alright" I thought to myself. Then she was picked up by a car, survives, touching ending where as usual in cinema the girl lives when she should have been one of if not the first one dead, and it was over.Needless to say it wasn't to my taste; there were too many glaring issues with the plausibility of such a simplistic plot to overlook. I think Frozen could have been great; it could have been well worth the entire wolf debacle. Unfortunately something that could have had that simple soul-touching horror of the everyday had a bunch of bunk injected into it and turned into something annoying and at times downright laughable.

[g]*This review contains spoilers of the non-vegetarian variety*Grace is one of those movies that will probably be far more disturbing to a woman than a man. That being said, disturbing is about where this movie ends at being worthwhile. It isn't a terrible film, and I'm not sure it could have been presented any better. There is something indefinable that grates on the nerves, if I had to try and put a finger on it that would probably be how unsubtly we are drawn toward the inevitable conclusion of the film.That may have been the titular problem of Grace, the fact that while it contains many things that women would find horrifying the film is determined to beat you over the head with them, making the gut wrenching grotesqueries ultimately laughable. The way that Grace is presented; an undead baby that has to feed on living blood, is painful. Especially when we take into account how deeply the mother wanted a baby and how important this was to her family. Throwing in the judgmental mother in law, ethical quandaries of a vegan main character, and creepily obsessed ex-girlfriend, and we're left with something very disturbing.Unfortunately for all the simplicity of the way the film was made the effects are at times difficult to get along with. Some of the flies are so fake it's painful, because Grace is a movie that has a very raw and honest appearance. When you have almost no special effects it is important that those put into the film flow. You end up losing the suspension of disbelief that the movie requires, and are left almost laughing at the actions of the harried mother.I really wanted to like Grace, while the ending was strangely annoying to me - after all how are you going to handle a toddler eating others, she can't breastfeed forever - the film had some very good points. The agony of the main character is very real and her desire to keep her child healthy and fit is also important. Her neurotic obsessive vegan behavior was more than slightly grating, but she's a bit insane...that's a given!Unfortunately within five minutes of the end credits I began to think on all the ways the movie wasn't believable to me. It was too over the top, too obvious, and resolved so suddenly with such a prolonged buildup and inevitably if a movie is going to leave you with that feeling it probably isn't worth watching more than once.Is Grace a terrible film? No! Is it a great or even good film? Certainly not! It is worth watching once, contemplating, and then putting aside in your mind before you begin to pick it apart like a fly going up your nose and out the other nostril picks up snot? Possibly, but probably not.

[m]When I was a teenager in the 50s, I lived across the street from the Coronet Theater where these films were being shown. (I once read that Chaplin had acting classes at the Coronet in the thirties.) I was used to the usual Hollywood formula films. However, when I started watching these experimental films, it opened up a new world of imagination for me. I'm so happy that this DVD was created showing these most original films which I find still fresh and original over fifty years later.

[m]This was completely different than the movie. Actually I found it hard to believe they called the movie Logan's Run.Most of the events are different and many of the visual descriptions are also different. If someone made a movie based more closely on the book it would be unrecognizable as a Logan's Run remake. It was an interesting book but I found the writing style a little strange compared to what I normally read.

[m]I thought the book was good and didn't follow the normal formulate. Very dark and depressing. The only fault I found was that it was badly written. There were places where there was no period to mark the end of a sentence so that it seemed two sentences were one. This required me to go back and reread it as two sentences. I noticed these strange punctuation problems throughout and found it suprising since I've heard of other works by this author (Like FLETCH). There was one part where (I think) it was PICK spelled as PIKC. The story is good one but I was wondering while I was reading this if there was an editor for the book or if some company just took the author's first draft as is and printed it as a book.

[m]I loved this documentary. It's a real eye opener. I had a retired script analyst help me learn the basics of screenwriting and with my experience, I think the analysist in this movie is just milking the screenwriter for his money. Without actually reading their screenplays, these people seemed doomed to fail. Even though this is real and the people and events are real, I could easily imagine Christopher Guest and those people who made those movies like Waiting For Guffman, making this as a movie. Christopher Guest would be the guy who morgages his house to produce his screenplay into a movie. There was one scene where the one screenwriter was eating with his wife and daughter at a restaurant and all he could talk about was hold he was trying to get Teri Hatcher to read his script. The wife looked miserable. One guy in the film actually succeeds and gets his screenplay made into a movie called Behind The Mask but he pays a price.

[m]I watched the 2 minute free preview of this movie and noticed they use the car / train crash scene from Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry at the beginning of this movie. What's funny is the parts that were different and leading up to the car crash I kept thinking to myself "That's just like the car from Diry Mary Crazy Larry. Then I saw the train and trought "and it's going to hit a train just like the car in Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" and then when it hit the train, the car exploded and crashed exactly the same as the one in Dirty Mary Crazy Larry. They had simply edited the graphics to make it look different but it was the same.

[m]Got this for finding those 'bad-dog' spots in the house--it worked! The black bodied light is the one you want for this purpose because it has the 370nM UV lights that seem to work better for finding urine. Remember not to look directly into the LEDs when you are using the UV emitters. UV exposure can damage your eyes. I also purchased a pair of UV-blocking goggles, which may be overkill, but is erring on the side of safety.High build quality. Why not 5 stars? Price a bit high, the Xenon bulb is only medium bright by today's standards, and it's a big light, with 3 C cells in it.

[m]I have nothing but praise for this product. It arrived well packaged in a paper bag, which allows it to breath and stay fresh when the customer gets it, and that bag sealed in plastic to protect it from the uncontrolled environments it might encounter during shipping. When I opened it, I was immediately hit with a delicious scent of fresh roasted hazelnuts. I couldn't resist eating a few right out of the bag.I cook often and use these chopped course in salads and especially tossed into freshly steamed asparagus. It's way more than I need at a time, so the rest got split into several smaller portions and vacuum packed. In the freezer they will keep almost as good as fresh for a year or more.SIX Stars!

[m]This is a good thriller. I was reminded of The Day of the Jackal. Someone is on his way to explode a nuclear weapon in the US and the question is whether he will succeed. The book is well plotted. Sadly it is spoiled by some of the worst proof reading I have ever seen.This book contains a language error in virtually every sentence. The errors are so consistent that someone must have tried to conform to some odd grammar.1. Plurals. Most plurals are formed by adding apostrophe s to a noun. E.g. "There were three car's in the driveway."2. Possessives. Most possessives were formed by adding s to a noun. E.g. "He opened the Fords passenger door."3. Past Participles. The past tense was consistently used as the past participle. E.g. "have went,"have chose,""have broke," etc."4. Double negatives. Some of the best double negatives I have ever encountered are found here. "They denied they neither built nor flew the weapon."Maybe it is just me, but I found it distracting to read a book that had so many errors in language.

[m]This book reminds me of Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ and Octavia Butler's _Wild Seed._ (This is very high praise, in case you didn't know.) None of these are hard sf -- if that's what you want read Arthur C. Clarke instead. They are mythic fiction, speculative fiction, horror, literature, historical fiction, urban fantasy, who cares what the genre is called? (Hint: no star ships here.) What Butler, Morrison and Barnes have in common is that their characters during slave times must make truly *terrible* choices to preserve their families. In the present Derek Waites, Austin Tucker and Dahlia Washington have to make similar bargains to keep their families intact. I have read Barnes' earlier work which is (for me) too reliant on physical violence. This book which has the thoughtful Derek and the kinesthetic Tucker is much more enjoyable. In fact, I couldn't put it down. That the backdrop for the story in the present is the Rodney King riots is visceral.So-- when will Smith and Pinkett make this as a movie?!!!

[m]Carey does such an amazing job of world-building that I feel like I've been in Terre d'Ange,(France) La Serenissima, (Venice) Menekhet, (Egypt), Akkadia (Iran, Iraq) and oh yes Drujan (Georgia &amp; Azerbaijan) along with her characters. (And I really, really didn't want to be in Drujan. It's a terrible horrible no good place.) Then they follow the Nile River to Lake Victoria. It's quite a hero's journey Phedre, Joscelin and then Imriel make. And as with hero's journeys, though a lot of land is covered, most of the changes are internal. I'm sorry to have finished this book. I read this long book quickly, without getting much sleep, I had to know what was coming next. I want to read more about these characters. Fortunately, according to the author's website, she is planning a series about Imriel. I wish I could read it ***now.***

[m]This is a novel for girls who like Pirates of the Caribbean; Nancy and Minerva are at least as exciting as heroes and pirates as the characters played by Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. (And much more interesting than the girl in that movie!) Nancy is a wealthy planter's daughter whose brothers attempt to marry her off to a violent and scary man to pay off their gambling debts. Minerva is her slave - and her friend. They "go on account" with an able and fair captain who rarely kills people. It's very good in the pirate history and a fun read.Someone said a girl of Nancy's social class wouldn't have done turned pirate. But Rees spent 150 pages exploring how little Nancy cared for upper class values and people. It wasn't easy for either girl to become pirate, their situation was truly dire. The class and racial politcs ring as true as the piracy -- the most democratic place in the early 18 century is a pirate ship! Like Witch Child and Sorceress, I hope there will be another book about Nancy and Minerva.

[m]In the 1840s western New York was known as the Burned- Over District because it was where Smith and the Mormons came from. Where Finney toured the country leading revivals in tents, where Miller prophesied the world would end in 1843, Noyes led a utopian community in Onieda and the Fox sisters heard ghosts "rapping" and began the spiritualist movement. The last four are all plot elements in this novel set in that place and time, rather reminiscent of Coville and Yolen's contemporary Armageddon Summer. The three Charter sisters Vern, Amy and Kate come to the attention of the Rev. Elias Fitcher, and one after the other they marry him. Kate succeeds in rescuing herself, her sisters and most of the people living in Harbinger - when the world ends but only for Fitcher.

[m]16-year-old Maggy takes care of her drunken mother, draws at her favorite caf&eacute; and is generally invisible. Until she meets the skwatter (her spelling) Cole and his harem, then she feels alive. When she sees what he's done to the other two girls, she gets herself and attempts to get the others away as well. At first, I thought Cole was a vampire, but no he's a conventional user. "...I look at him once and I can't look away. Like the most perfect picture you ever saw, a walking wish come true: crow- black hair and loose green jacket, tall, even taller than me but when he moves it's not jerky or gawky, just pure grace, like he really belongs in his body, like it's his favorite place to be."_The Blue Mirror_ is well worth reading.

[m]This book was recommended to me by someone who saw I liked Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, as having a similar setting. In Spencer's fantasy novel women lead the society, women are the soldiers and farmers, it is matrifocal, while men raise the children. Men are rare and highly valued, as a result. Spencer's book is light and fun and the oldest brother, who is about ready to be married off, has adventures. READ THAT BOOK!!!This one one has a 16 year old girl Xylina, a magic user as the narrator. Faro (or Ware)would have been better choices. It's better storytelling to read the POV of the underdog than the Alpha Dog. Especially when the Alpha Dog whines as much as this one does. And goes through nonsensical changes.

[g]Seriously, if teenage girls looked back to 1985, 1989 and 1990 when Whitney, Mariah and Celine all released thier debuts, you know there is nothing new with Kelly. The truth is even though she is pretty hot her vocals are mediocore. She can do the shouting thing but to dub her as &quot;the next mariah carey&quot; is a disgrace to Mariah. And Celine Dion?! Please! kelly's high notes are very weak. You can hear that in &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Miss Independent.&quot; This record was done for SALES ONLY... nothing from the heart. It needs to be more xperimental and less Clive, David Foster and Diane Warren stuff. &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; is a much better example of pop with great vocals. Same with &quot;Mariah Carey.&quot; Let's see... she borrowed a song off Christina, put on bland material like &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; (C-L-I-C-H-E!!), let Diane Warren repeat herself again and put Tamyra in who deserved to win! If I didn't know this was Kelly, I thought it would be an artist like Pink or Christina Aguilera. She is very average and has the ego the size of Texas. She needs to come back to earth and record something DECENT if she wants my respect. Ditch Clive, Kelly. Check out Desmond Child, Shek'spere, Kandi Buruss, DarkChild or God forbid pen your own songs YOURSELF and have them based on personal experiences. Check out LeAnn Rimese's &quot;twisted angel&quot; instead You will be forever greatful.

[m]I really liked his album &quot;Crash&quot; and his sophomore album with &quot;Stay&quot; (my favorite song by his band). Even &quot;I Did It&quot; was pretty cool. But while they had good songs, all DMB did was repeat themselves. They have their limits and the music prooves it. I respect them as a band but they need to be more innovative. This record along with its singles will probably flop. Buy &quot;Crash&quot; instead.

[m]Thebleedingalarm, always spelt in lowercase with all three words mashed together, are a five piece rock band out of Canada that just recently signed to Immortal Records. Apparently the demo was so good that the label decided not to make any changes to it; just repackage and release it as the bands debut album.Though not quite as good as Immortal would have you believe, thebleedingalarm have some promise. They're emo in the same sense that Moments in Grace are, they have a large emo appeal but I wouldn't go about tossing them right in the genre. Their leads remind me of Alexisonfire's Watch Out!which is nice to hear since not many bands are using that type of jerky/multi note lead work.The disc itself really starts to shake about half-way through with the song ""Amber in Ashes."" This track exemplifies strong screamo and propels the rest of this album forward. It's a shame the first half isn't as good as the proceeding songs... ""Sorrows the Seas of my Heart"" is chock full of wonderful melody and the title track is a true monster, filled with desperation and anguish.All in all, for most people, this album will probably get tossed into the "typical screamo" corner and never get listened to again. I hear a little more melody in some of this bands songs and their hooks are pretty tight so I hear a world of potential. Instead of re-releasing this album, I would have had the band go back into the studio and work on an entirely new album--I hear maturity, but I know that a second album from this band would have produced much better results in the same way that Alexisonfire's second album is far superior to their debut.If you're down with screamo that has strong melodies, this is for you. Just don't think you're buying the next Too Bad You're Beautiful.For Fans of: Alexisonfire, From Autumn to Ashes, Brand New

[m]Soundscapes of atmospheric rock. The opening track to Faulter's Darling Bud's of May will have new 30 Seconds to Mars fans standing on their seats screaming the anthemic chorus and swaying in slow unison to this melancholic burner. Not to sit on their hands for too long, Faulter kicks it into pop rock high gear for "I Think We Need to Talk" by channeling the spirit of Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World and the vaguely reminiscent Jimmy Eat Worldesque "October 16th." This may be one of the first discs where the promotional material that came with it actually nailed what this band sounded like. The tightness of their sound is only helped by the drumming of Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle/Nine Inch Nails) but to be honest, these kids can write a good song even if they're not leaving the box to do it. Don't sleep on them but don't take them for more than they are!

[g]As the first notes of ""Shakes in Your Mouth"" and ""Say Goodbye"" wrong through my speakers, there's one band that comes to mind immediately: As I Lay Dying. These guys are performing a style of Gothenburg hardcore made famous over here in the States by As I Lay Dying. In fact, it would be tough to say that there is much of anything separating the two bands save the few thousand miles between Australia and America.Slow beatdown sections, fast paced Gothenburg riffs that sound eerily like In Flames/At The Gates b-sides and clean vocals that tie back to the aforementioned As I Lay Dying sum up what this band is about. It gets so bad that ""The Deepest Sleep"" sounds like it could be a cover of an As I Lay Dying song.Skip it.For Fans of: As I Lay Dying, In Flames, Killswitch Engage

[m]These aren't the best quality in the world, because the metal doesn't feel completely smooth to the touch, but they are still very attractive and sturdy. They match my metal wire shelving unit perfectly because they are made of the same shiny round steel (which is also not perfectly smooth I am discovering). The other hooks I found at the Container Store that are designed to work with these shelves do clip on a little tighter, but they still wobble, and they don't look like they belong with the shelves, since they are a more muted metal and flat instead of round. I'm using them in my boys' bedroom so they can hang up their many different school bags and video game bags as they come home.

[m]I stumbled across these bars at an industry trade show and brought home the Cookies and Cream flavor for my picky 10 year old son . Out of the hundreds of sample bars I brought home he picked this one and tried it without me even knowing. Maybe the cheetah on the front? Anyway, He loved it and it has become his favorite nutrition bar! (His old favorite nutrition bar was Balance Bar's Cookie Dough.)He still loves these bars best even though he tried the two other flavors. I just put them on subscription so I'll have plenty in the house for him and the hockey team.

[m]I've already played all Gogol Bordello's later CDs by now - over and over. Decided to see what Eugene was doing a few years ago. Wow! I'm glad I did. A few of these songs are on later CDs but track 6 is found nowhere else that I'm aware of. I'm nuts about Madagascar. It sounds like nothing else he has done and that wonderful gypsy song at the end won't leave my head. Eugene's lyrics alone are worth the price of any of his CDs, then the music just blows the lid off.

[g]After reading 100 pages I realized I was completely uninterested in the characters or the story, if there was one. Since I had expected to enjoy the book I decided to keep reading and hoped I'd be glad I did. So at 279 pages (over half way through) when nothing else had happened at all I decided to call it quits. Yeah, I understand lots of scene setting and intro to all the characters, etc. But for 279 (or more maybe)pages? The first half of this book seriously needed an editor to cut, cut cut. With about half of the verbiage cut out maybe I could have reached the part where the plot started. Because half-way through there was no evidence at all of any storyline.

[m]I've been trying many different products to control my chronic stress and related high Cortisol levels. I'm not interested in loosing belly fat/inches because I don't have any. I've been disappointed by all the products I've tried because they all contain stimulants [caffeine, guarana, epeherine or their derivatives...] and that drives me up the wall and prevents me from sleeping. I tried Relacore because it contains vitamins that are directly related to stress management [vitB] by acting on the adrenal glands. Also the formula contains herbs that calm the nervous system. I just finished my first bottle and I noticed in the last month that I was calmer, I slept much better, my appetite and digestion are working very well, my energy is much improved [without any over-stimulation] and a lot of anxiety and tension has left my body... I couldn't ask for more... Thank you!

[g]I honestly disliked most Megadeth albums after RIP as "thrash". CTE was good but kinda too slow and kinda pop. Everything after CTE was either not enough defining as anything but trying to continue from CTE with more songs, which got old like less than halfway through Youthanasia, or they were just altogether bad. This one is different, every song is left reverberating through your head even after it's over, the album never gets boring. I don't think this one would have sounded good faster, it's good at the speed it is, and a good buy even if you're not a Megadeth superfan.

[m]When I was in Korea about ten years ago, I heard about this movie, but I have not seen this move until DVD is released recently.This movie is not for everyone, because it is hard to understand Zen and other underlying stories (also the cinematography). I am not a Buddhist, but I think I know better than usual Western viewers. Keep in mind that my review is of novice.At first scene, you hear very loud warning sounds from traffic signals and sounds of a train passing by. The sounds from wooden bells carried by Buddhists have been used to open the closed minds of common people (fools) by the strong wave energy penetrating into their inner minds. You later hear sounds of the wooden bell by the monk in the market. Also, you can hear various sounds from metallic bells and others in the movie.The Zen koan is also used to open the closed mind by sudden striking force. You can not easily escape from old habits, stereotypes and various beliefs which you have accumulated and learned after your birth. To cut those connections which are usually obstacles to the Way to enlightenment, you need some sudden and strong force. A sound or koan can be used for this purpose.'Karma' is a basic principle to make the story in the movie. The boy killed a bird. He later suffered in water. The cow symbolizes a kind of lucky guider when you are struggling to escape from darkness. Due to any kind of guider, you can have a chance to move toward the enlightenment or Nirvana, which is given because you have accomplished somethings or have helped other lives during the past life.The woman wearing black Korean cloth is the boy's mother. She appeared in the dream of the boy when he struggled to escape from a crisis. I could not interpret who is the woman who danced when the old monk (master) was to pass away.There are other 'karma' stories overlapping each other, but I could not interpret all of them. I believe I can understand most of stories, after seeing the movie several times more.What is the answer to the title, &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot;. My primary answer is that he left because he could not stay at the same place any longer.

[m]As a native Korean, I enjoyed the book despite my handicap in reading in English. It was interesting to know what Westerners think about reincarnation.This book certainly is based on scientific skepticism. I enjoyed the tours into Lebanon and India, where everyone must be a kind of philosopher to survive in such miserable conditions. Reincarnation is a question for life and death, endless cyclic struggles to maturity.One objection to the author is that scientific experiments are feasible for validating or falsifying the concept of reincarnation. Several years ago, I watched a commercial TV show made in Korea that compared the predictions by two persons who insisted that they can track down or can see the past lives of people. One person was a psychiatrist who uses hypnoanalysis, and the other was a psychie who allegedly was able to see the images of the past lives. In the sense of blind experiment, the descriptions of the past lives of several subjects by the two person were nearly coincident. If rate of coincidence is statistically significant, you may reject a null hypothesis, and vice versa. I do not believe that the TV show was a hoax. I expect some scientific studies will be published in the near future. although too many people are too skeptistic nowadays.

[m]This mouse is awesome. I use it with my desktop because I enjoy the smaller size as I am able to grasp it with my fingertips for more control.Pros: Easy to control, scroll wheel can be put into a friction-less mode to where it just spins freely, attractive.Cons: Mediocre reception, possibly wifi interference?, no bluetooth model available, clunky windows software, however the OSX version isn't too badBottom line is if you want a stylish mouse that is easy to use and doesn't have 10,000 useless buttons, this is the one.

[m]This book can appear daunting, but Bryson's writing style makes all the difference. As a science educator, I can see this as wonderful supplemental reading for most highschoolers and some middleschoolers. In school, students are giving various facts and are expected to put it all together to get the big picture. This book will help with that big picture. An intire course could be taught with this book for advanced students. For adults it's wonderful at reinforcing knowledge, and putting things into perspective. I see there is now an illustrated version, which I may check out, but this original version is written so that it's easy to get mental images. I have heavily highlighted and footnoted my copy for future reference, as it is so chocked full of information.

The box indicates many form of extreme motorsports, but it is 90% crotch rockets with idiots destroying perfectly good tires for a minute smoke, and trashing expensive bikes, while endangering other bystanders..It is truly amazing what these guys can do on bikes and bounce back for more. I remember driving the interstate through Chicago when this loud roar comes up from behind and passes us going at least 90mph. About a dozen bikes pass with 3-4 doing wheelies. I immediately decide that if one goes down, I'll just have to run them over. I wasn't about to risk my life and my passengers lives and the lives of others, by swerving. This movie depicts illegal, exceptionally dangerous behavior which should not be attempted by anyone.

[m]I bought this on a whim a few years ago, and have been cooking from it - occasionally - ever since.I don't cook from it as often as I'd like because the recipes are very involved. Not complicated, or difficult, but involved. Very few of the recipes involve just ONE item. Most of them require you to cook one thing, in order to make another. Yeah, there are ways to shortcut the process, but the results aren't as good as doing it the "right" way. When you follow the recipes as written, the results are generally EXCELLENT. I think the only one I've made that I was disappointed with was the Mole chicken - but then, maybe I just don't like mole. (I'm not big on chocolate).The Wings O Fire are OUTSTANDING. I bring these to parties and get nothing but raves. (I simplified the process by having my sister mix up the Fuego Spice mix in bulk and I make a large batch of the Blazin BBQ sauce and water bath can it, so to make a batch of wings is easy).In short, a well written winner, but be aware that the recipes are involved and time consuming, but the results are WORTH it.

[m]Since music has so many personal preferences to it, touting that everyone will like him is unwise. However, if you even remotely like the sound of a 12 string guitar you will find something of interest by Dominic Gaudious.His website (...dominicgaudious'dot'com) has free download samples and links to videos. Additionally, YouTube has several videos of him in action.Not many people have the talent to play a custom guitar and DIDGERIDOO at the same time. Don't know what a DIDGERIDOO is? You've heard one - if, you have watched any of the "Crocodile Dundee" movies. Go to his Internet site for more information.

[m]After quite a bit of research this lathe was selected as having the most for its price (more bang for the buck). There are probably better deals available but, they are rare and difficult to find. Lathe machining is truly one of those areas that you get what you put into it.My original intended use for this lathe was for making 1:35th to 1:700th scale model parts and associated tools. For such use the lathe is a bit over-sized. Even used smaller lathes are, generally, much more expensive. The biggest drawback(s) is/are the lathe is not very ready to run "out of the box" and to make the lathe fit your particular use several 'accessories' need to be purchased. Purchasing lathe 'accessories'(machinist jargon: tooling) can cost as much, or more likely, more than the original lathe. Thus, for budget considerations plan on at least doubling the price of a lathe for tooling. As an example plan on spending, at least, $800.00 if you find this lathe on sale for $400.00.Some reviewers, found on the internet (search for: 7x10 or 7x12 mini-lathe), have stated that this lathe comes boxed as a kit. For most common purposes they are correct. Quite a bit of time and effort go into dis-assembling, cleaning, reassembling, and properly adjusting the lathe before it is ready to make anything (machinist jargon: make chips). There are also several modifications that may need to be made for general and custom purposes; it's an individual choice. There are very few step by step instructions available for making parts in a lathe. The bottom line is a lot of time and brain power is necessary before any part gets made.To sum things up, purchasing this lathe one day and making useful parts the next day is not likely to happen. Having a very clear idea in mind of what your goal is or what specific parts are to be made will save time and money. Also, if you are willing to do a lot of reading, research, planning, and practice getting your hands dirty in addition to making a number of mistakes, this is an ideal lathe to start with. The only way to cut down on time and expense would be to have a machinist willing to teach you...

[g]As I neared the end of this tough-NY girl-who beats dope and finds-her-calling-in-life book, I was absolutely rooting for not just the main character Jo Flannigan but the author as well. She seemed to be setting herself up for a series of books starring Jo as the main character and I thought: "Wow, she's really tied this up nicely and left herself room for other books." But then came the ending and it blew me and the main character out of the water. The book then reminded me of "In The Cut" (good book/horrible movie but good sex scenes). Still, I guess I have to give the author credit for staying pure to her vision -- she didn't take the easy way out that's for sure. This book is for those who dig a cool New York mentality from the 1950s and that appeals to me, absolutely. So Sara, I was with you all the way for the ride but disappointed to have to fall off at the end.

[m]...it's disturbing on many levels. Not only because in New York one minute you can be walking down the street thinking about the cookies you just bought and the next you're kidnapped by gun-toting thugs but also because it's scary to know that people who think so little of life and the law are living very close by. As a die-hard native New YOrker, believe me when I tell you I've come across many many people just like the thugs Alpert runs across in his book. I totally understand where Alpert is coming from. Yeah, while he's kidnapped, he thinks constantly about leaving New York but no surprise -- he's still living here. Me too, even though I know how dangerous and unpredictable this place can be. The tourists don't know the half of it; if they did, they'd never come. But it's a fascinating book...partly because it confirms my worst fears.Tacoma Confidential: A True Story of Murder, Suicide, and a Police Chief's Secret Life (48 Hours Mystery)Nightmare in Napa: The Wine Country Murders (48 Hours Mystery)

The magnet is so strong that it pulls the nails out of the walls of the houses and the houses collapse. See what I mean.

[m]Not often does a newspaper of The Times' eminence publish its in-house style and usage guide. (Writers of 1976 last saw an edition of this book.) This guide gives students, teachers and professionals the tools to write well. I have found many usage notes that I did not previously know.I found that this book borders on being a tad too politically correct.It doesn't reach the point of crossing this border, but it does come close. It insists that people call cripples a people who have lost the use of their legs.Also, this book could have included a few more grammar terms that the average person would not know. There are too many terms that the average educated person knows, like when to use &quot;a/an.&quot; What the book could have summed up in two sentences encompassed almost a page. Conversely, what should have taken up a page, the book treated in a few sentences.Further, it seems like the book purposely omitted esoteric newspaper terms that would be found in the in-house edition found at The Times' headquarters at 229 West 43rd. I'd really like to have read about the various font sizes and columns and the like. But the authors decided for me that I was apt not to be interested in reading about that arcanca.Otherwise, this book is an enjoyable read. BUY IT, STUDY IT! (You should also buy Stunk's and White's The Elements of Style, also available for purchase here on Amazon.com)

[g]This book lacks any content. When it does say something, it is brief. Don't buy this book: invest in Elements of Style or the NYT Style Book. This one is skimpy and cursory.

[g]This 1955 epic was a commendable effort by producer George Pal to give the public a more-or-less realistic look at what space travel might be like a few decades ahead, with no monsters and aliens and all that. But the result is a film that is MORE dated, and less enjoyable, than SF films made even earlier which DID have monsters and aliens and all that. Almost every character is a corny stereotype, including the inevitable crude -but-basically-smart funny guy from Brooklyn. The film includes two memorably ridiculous plot contrivances.

[g]If you are looking for a film with John Barrymore at the peak of his talent, before he deteriorated into a parody of himself, this is the one. Barrymore plays an aggressive lawyer caught in a professional dilemma which almost pushes him to suicide. The film is based on a play by Elmer Rice and, except for an establishing shot of the Empire State Building, is set entirely inside an office. But, surprisingly, it does NOT have a cramped, stagebound feel to it, mainly due to the gripping nature of the story. Not to be missed.

[m]Rather archaic, and a bit difficult to sit through, this is still a fascinating film. On re-screening it recently, I found that some scenes had lingered in my memory for 43 years. Death takes human form temporarily to satisfy his curiosity about why we humans fear him so much. During his "holiday", no one dies. The idea that a moratorium on death for a few days would not become immediately obvious and would not cause screaming headlines worldwide cannot be taken seriously, nor can the entire film. (Check out the climactic announcement, "He is -- Death!!" Very melodramatic.) This is a film that requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but if you do so, you will enjoy it. Fredric March was an unusual choice to portray Death, but he does his typically fine job. Science fiction writer Fred Pohl has said that seeing this film in his early teens caused him to not fear death.

[g]Not sure why it has such a low star rating but this was a good movie. Really a 4 star movie but since it has such a low star rating, thought I try to bring it up.

[g]This is a side project of one of the Slipknot members, Joey Jordison. Alot of Slipknot fans like it, so right off the bat you can tell not much good is gonna come out of it. The guitar is alright. Tripp Eisen is a reasonably good guitarist, and has some cool riffs here and there, but the rhythm section is very weak, and Wednesday 13s vocals are just bad. The lyrics are also very bad..pretty much just cheesy B horror movie garbage. This is an album that all of the maggots and mall goths are probably going to buy and love, but for anyone whos into real metal...or..music, for that matter, not recommended.

[g]You can tell touring with Aerosmith and Kiss had a big impact on these guys. With this album they tried to do the whole "rock and roll" sound. The only problem with that is that Saliva doesnt have nearly enough talent to do this type of music. All of these songs are ruined by Josey Scotts whiney, nasal and terrible vocals, and the guitar solos are a joke. The thing is that some of the songs here are decent. Rock and Roll Revolution would be a good song, with a new vocalist and new guitarist. These guys really just need to stick to nu-metal, thats the only genre they have enough talent for (which doesnt require any). And yes...Saliva did steal the riff from "The Fight Song" by Marilyn Manson. Listen to them both and compare. Not recommended.

[g]In my opinion, Bleeding Through is a band with alot of potential. All of the members of the band are talented, particularly the drummer. But they just dont put their talent to good use. Like someone said above, this CD is like 1 big 45 minute track. It sounds like 1 song pasted onto an album 12 times..and while the 1 song is damn good in my opinion, I cant listen to this album all the way through.PROS:Well, in my opinion the vocals are very good. Brandon S. is a good screamer and is extremely aggressive. He doesnt use his clean voice alot but when he does it contrasts nicely with his screaming. In my opinion hes a talented vocalist. The rest of the band is good too. The guitar is good, but the rhythm section is especially very good. The drumming was impressive, and if you watch any of their music videos the bass is pretty crazy, but its often buried under the rest of the instruments. Marta, the keyboardist doesnt play anything complicated or hard..but she does still give the album a unique touch, and Bleeding Through wouldnt be the same without her. Like I stated above...Bleeding Through is a talented band! But...CONS:...all of the songs sound too god damn alike. It really honestly feels like they wrote 1 song and made minor changes to it 12 times and called it an album. The lyrics could also be better. Theyre not terrible, but theyre too angsty for my taste and at times seem like theyre aimed at the Hot Topic crowd.Overall, I think Bleeding Through is a band with monster potential..but like I said, they dont use it, and with the little variety this CD has I cant bring myself to give it more than 2 stars.

[m]Seriously. Listen to "Someday" and "How You Remind Me" at exactly the same time. They are almost the EXACT same song!! Try it for yourself, I urge you.

[m]"Dont blame us if we ever doubt ya, you know we couldnt live without ya, Red Sox, you are the onlyyy..."Couldntve said it better myself. This is the official song for the Red Sox now, and I suppose it worked. But, even without the Red Sox references, this is still a good song. DKM have an interesting Irish/Rock/Punk sound that suprisingly works very well with the lyrics of the song.RED SOX - 2004 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS

[g]Yeah, I realize that that song isnt on this album. But I just find it hilarious that they would write a song about famous people "pissing and moaning" and then turn around and make a song like "Predictable", where Joel sings/yells prepubescently about pathetic high school drama. I know most of you mall punks who are over weight 8th graders who wear star wrists bands are scared of singers who have actually hit puberty, so Im not going to bother recommending another band or album because having an intelligent conversation with a Good Charlotte fan is damn near impossible. Open your eyes; they want your money!

[m]This is an incredible performance from Alice In Chains. One of the first things that really struck me about it was that often times you would forget that its a live album. Jerry Cantrells playing is so precise, and Layne Staleys voice so powerful (especially with him and Jerry harmonizing) that it sounds just as good as a studio version. They play the obvious favorites such as Down In A Hole, Rooster and Nutshell, but they also played a few of their heavier songs such as Would and Angry Chair, which suprisingly translate well into acoustic versions. This is an essential pick up for any Alice In Chains fan, it shows their great live performance and their passion and emotion.R.I.P Layne Staley

[m]This Stones album has been reviewed into the ground, both those that love it and those that don't. I'm not going to attempt to persuade either side but only to make this point: if no one had ever heard of the Rolling Stones and this album by an unknown band came on the market would it be declared the masterpiece that it widely is? I doubt it. The Stones were already considered the greatest rock band ever at this point - a declaration I'm happy to say I don't agree with - and thus Exile arrived with Stones fans already highly anticipating it. It's not so much that the album continues no signature hits, it's the fact that, well, the quality of the writing just isn't up to that set by earlier records. Taken completely on its own, Exile is an interesting exercise in its moods and textures but hardly an album to run out and buy. The album is only one of the most overrated of this period BECAUSE it was hyped as not only one of the Stones best but one of the best albums of the era.

[m]I LOVE Whitney Houston. I think they was once the most talented vocalist of all time. She could sing and make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.But this CD sounds like Destiny's Child's baby sister singing.

[g]As a born and raised southerner, I got a kick out of this book. There were several phrases I'd heard and never thought about the origins of. There were also expressions that were new to me. The writing itself is hysterically funny, and there are many pokes at being southern in the book. Very enjoyable "dictionary."One word of caution - it's a small, short book! I didn't look at page count before I bought it, so I was expecting more.

[g]Ugh! I can't believe this gets so many positive reviews, ostensibly from people who have dry hair... I have fluffy, dry, fly-away, curly hair. This shampoo sucks! It seems to destroy my hair. The best solution I've found is to use conditioner instead of shampoo, and occasionally use a TINY BIT of a certain weird shampoo from the health food store mixed with straight jojoba oil.If your hair is dry enough for you to be shopping for a "hydrating" shampoo, chances are, you shouldn't be using shampoo at all. It is one of the worst things you can do to fragile hair. I am so angry that I've been using shampoo for so many years, destroying my hair, searching for the "right" shampoo, not realizing that there was no "right" shampoo. Even the new sulfate-free non-shampoo "cleansers" dry the @#$% out of my hair.ANYWAY. Second of all, it is GROSSLY OVER-SCENTED with the most sickening, cloying perfume, and I felt like I was drowning in it in the shower, and when I went to bed my pillow case would reek of it. I used it until it was gone because I had spent so much money on it and I was still convinced that it would help my hair over time.

[m]she has stumbled on a major key to feeling good. You need to eat greens every day! They are their own food group, not to be lumped into "vegetables"'s group. You can't really eat the greens you need every day, so take a short cut and put them in the blender and drink 'em. That's the point. The book is worth reading because it explains it in depth and gives you ideas. I LOVE THIS BOOK! Yeah, I know there are some weird errors. Irrelevant to the merit of the book.

[m]This is a series that was far ahead of its time. If it were on today, this would be a headliner on Cartoon Swim. It is full of good-natured violence, ridiculous fast-paced prose, zany antics, and detailed artwork that makes it stand out from the crowd. I love cartoons, but there are few that hold up as well as this does. Strongly recommended.

[m]I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift. She was very happy with this product. I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these. All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product. She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold. She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally. She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design. Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page.............

[m]My Aunt Got this and I inherited with the house. As one person noted, moving it is not an option. My Aunt got someone to put the shelves in, wooden with the notches on the back corners to fit. Then, the same guy used steel screws to secure the roof to the sides so it wouldn't blow off. I wish I could get this for the original price of about $200! I'm looking at another one as I must get a lawnmower now--the yard service we have as part of our homeowners association fee gets us a crappy cutting service, but for $25 each month, I'm not going to complain about it too much. Anyhow, I've outgrown the other one, and need to get another one on board in the next six months. I recommend it, with the caveats that everyone who posted prior to me have noted.Linda11 September 2012I did get a second one. Went together super easy. Love it. The shelves didn't need notching for this one. I also didn't screw anything of it together. Still holding very well!--

[m]There's very little I can add to the previous reviews except to say that this was the reason I bought a CD player years ago. More out of curiosity than anything else, I happened to pick up a copy of "Louis Prima: the Capitol Collectors Series" in its audiocassette format back in the early Nineties. Let me assure you, this is Prima at his best, during the wild and swinging Fifties, when his was "THE" act to see in Las Vegas. From the opening number, "Just A Gigolo," I was hooked. There isn't a single track (with the possible exception of "Beep! Beep!") that I didn't enjoy. The man was a master at his craft. No one's a bigger fan of Dean Martin's than me, but when you compare Dino's versions of "Oh, Marie" and "Buona Sera" to Louis', Prima blows him away. Feeling depressed? Down in the dumps? Put on this CD and you'll soon be "jump, jive and wailin'" along with Louis, his then wife Keely Smith, Sam Butera, and the rest of the Wildest. Guaranteed!

[m]I find it somewhat ironic that this "fictionalized" portrait of Jack "Legs" Diamond is far superior to many of the factual biographies of this celebrated mobster which have been published to date. Told in the words of the imaginary Marcus Gorman, an attorney who is seduced by the charismatic gangster and swept into his orbit, "Legs" is probably as close to the truth as we can get. Kennedy's use of dialogue is, in a word, brilliant. I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did, but I found it to be a great read.

[g]If they were seeking to completely destroy the Ghost Rider Film Franchise they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. I saw the first movie and loved it, but it doesn't count here since they completely discounted it for the sequel. With no decent story and some of the worst acting I have ever seen Nicolas Cage do this movie falls flat on it's face. From the moment it starts you are wishing it was over. I gave it one star and that was to much.

[m]OK. If you are into it, this is realy authentic folk playing and singing. Recorded in 1954 (excelently restored!), gives an overview of many Italian regions, not excluding minorities (Albanians of Calabria and Slavs of Venezia-Giulia), with the traditional music performed by local artists.Most impressive moment: A capella Calabrian song recorded on a fishing ship, while the crew (20 half-naked, (so the notes say!),fishermen) is raising an undersea net. It is a bawdy song, but strangely beautiful. You can hear squeaking and squeeling of the capstain throughout the song.Full notes, all texts and translations, and history. Bravo!No cheap commercial stuff, my friends, but real life material...

[m]much better (and a bit more expensive) than the heavy grips brand. I'm a big tough guy (or at least thought I was) but I can only close the 2.5 a couple of times with my dominate hand. In response to the reviewers who claim that these tear up your hands - well duh!, these have a very aggresive knurling due to the fact that they are serious strength training equipment. To be honest, I wrapped 1/2 of mine with some athletic tape (but at least I didn't cry about it on the review!).

[m]This thing worked great, exactly as advertised. But it only did it twice. Then the non-stick coating on the egg-poaching cup started to peel off. "Oh, that's not a big deal," you say. Well, it's actually a rather big deal indeed. The teflon stuff doesn't just peel off all at once, and you can't just scrape off the "iffy" part and then be done with it. No, every time you make eggs, from now until eternity, little chunks of teflon will come off and attach themselves to your otherwise-perfect egg.This is a very serious design flaw. I tried a workaround (putting in a piece of foil in the cup) but it doesn't work (the eggs don't cook through, if you're wondering, and there's no way to adjust for it).I'm going to call the company and see if they have functional replacements. I note that a number of other reviews have complained about this problem -- perhaps they've taken notice. If so, I'll gladly come back and give this thing the rating it would otherwise deserve.

[g]I wanted the original movie on DVD, and that's what I got. It doesn't bother me that it's not anamorphic. It doesn't bother me that it's letterbox.I gave it 5 stars because I'm rating THE MOVIE, *NOT* the TECHNOLOGY. To paraphrase Shakespeare, the story's the thing.

[m]While this book is certainly a far cry from 'traditional' when compared to most fantasy novels, the stilted and extremely choppy writing style, along with the rambling plot left me clueless as to how it could have possibly won the World Fantasy Award. There are far better books out there.

[g]I purchased this book because the main character, Odd Thomas, sounded very intriguing. Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to its promise, in my opinion.Chapter 4 began... "I see dead people." And that remark was followed by something along the lines of "But, by God, I *do* something about it." The problem with this is that it immediately raised the spectre of comparisons to M. Night Shyamalan's movie THE SIXTH SENSE. This was a bad thing. While books and movies are completely different mediums, and while I understand *why* and *how* they are different, one of the few things they *do* have in common is the intended audience's reaction to them. Due to some personal experiences of my own, Shyamalan's movie had me spooked for weeks(!!!) afterward. But ODD THOMAS? I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start reading Rowling's latest Potter novel. In other words, ODD was forgettable.While Koontz did a passingly good job of planting Odd's psychic magnetism early on in the story, its use at the end of the book completely deflated the story of any buildup of tension. Odd didn't seem terribly worried about the horrific things he believed were going to happen, so I wasn't worried. Odd move. Bad move! Therefore, low ratings.

The answering machine is also a redundant feature cause most phone services come with voicemail but still not bad for the price

[m]My previous viewing of Amadeus was in a college classroom presented on VHS format on a large NTSC tube television. In that sitting the film came across as best it could I suppose, I saw a bit of the genius in Shaffer's screenplay, however it was less than grand and at times very difficult to hear the actors clearly (not to mention a muffled soundtrack). Looking for older movies on Blu I was excited to hear about this film. I knew it had the potential to be an excellent example of why Blu-Ray matters and I'm very happy Warner Bros gave this package treatment worthy of 5 stars.Given the right equipment, a Blu-Ray viewing of Amadeus is incredible. The Doulby TrueHD lossless audio is excellent and the 1080p picture quality almost as good. Considering the lack of quality, properly calibrated displays in theaters when this film was released in the mid 80's; as with many classics released on Blu-Ray, a home theater viewing will be like the first time seeing this film for many.The Blu-Ray book package contains the Directors Cut of the film along with many bonus features on the first disc. It also contains a digital copy of the movie on a DVD (data) disc which is copy-protected Windows Media format standard definition, lastly it contains an audio CD containing some of Mozart's most memorable pieces of music.Some films deserve nothing less than the best quality audio and video possible and this is one of those movies. If you're even a casual fan of classical music this is one purchase you will not regret.

[g]While this product is intended for use with RVs, I use it as an inexpensive and convenient way to filter tap water for homebrewing beer. I simply thread it onto a white, drinking water hose (also an RV product)and direct the flow into my hot liquor tank. The filtered water tastes very pure and clean, with no hint of chlorine.I find this product to be very economical and convenient, and a lot simpler than other filtering solutions. After use, I simply drain the excess water, place it in a ziplock bag and stow it in the fridge until my next brewing session.

[g]The first book in the Baritmaeus Trilogy was good, so I picked up this second book and expected to like the book as I had the first one. Instead, I heartily enjoyed it.I've started collecting books for my children and will turn around and sell any that are poorly written or are just plain dull. This series is a keeper!I tend to skim through sections of books that are wallowing in tedious, dry, and boring detail, but this book keeps your attention with well-written detail that doesn't skimp on the character development. The plot twists are fresh, the storyline is fun, and this is an overall wonderful book. I'm looking forward to the final book in the trilogy--Stroud's books so far have been a treat.Believe the high ratings for this book and treat yourself to some good fun and good reading.

[g]The title describes quite well just where the series has wandered. This movie seems to be nothing more than an ill attemptto keep the saga alive. Moreover I believe there is more footage of the original film in this monstrosity than anything new director Coscarelli has drempt up.There are aspects of the film that work well though. For instance the atmosphere is the creepiest since the Cocteauian original and realy sets an eery mood. Furthermore Coscarelli has scraped the idea of numerous sub-characters found in the prequels to establish a final showdown between the key players.However, the definitive Phantasm this is not. Those in hope of answers to the mythos of the pernicious Tall Man will be greeted with obscure answers that lead to yet more questions. One begins to wonder if Coscarelli is apprehensive to reveal too much in fear of diminishing Phantasm's mystque, or perhaps the director is just biding his time until(or if) the funding for Phantasm's End comes around.Whatever the reason this lackluster attempt to prolong the series will most likely fail to inspire even the most die hard of fans.

[m]I bought this CD player simply because it was the only one I could find that was not too wide for my entertainment center. Unfortunately, it's a roll of the dice whether the disc changer will work with the remote or not--usually not. Also, It's a roll of the dice whether the player will play a CD or not. I've had brand new CD's out of the box not play at all on this player. I've moved them to another player and they work perfectly. So--unless you're really desperate, I'd pass this CD player by....

[m]After struggling with a friend for an hour trying everything in the world to make this player work, I had to give up and put it back in the box. It would sometimes play the CD in tray 3, but ignored all the other trays and would just sit there doing nothing. Save yourself the heartache--DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!!!ADDENDUM--8/14/12Because I couldn't find another changer that was 15" or less deep to fit in my entertainment center, I took a chance and re-ordered this changer. The second one works perfectly and sounds great...today. I'll keep you posted about how long it lasts.

[g]I have a RepairMaster 5Y warranty for an LG washer dryer. First it took them 2 weeks to honor the warranty. I have a cracked drain hose which, due to LG design, and confirmed by a call to LG, is only technician-replaceable. The RepairMaster/Warrantech warranty is filled with exclusions not printed on the card you receive when you buy the warranty. When I described the problem to RepairMaster/Warrantech, they refused to fix it, stating that it fell under their exclusions. They claim it is an external user-serviceable part in spite of LG claiming that the connection is internal and not user-serviceable.RepairMaster/Warrantech has a C- rating with Better Business Bureau. I think any company that sells their warranties (including Amazon), should also have a C- rating.

[m]I'm a lifelong fan of Joni, and listened to this "album" with anticipation. The first 4 cuts, by contemporary artists, were unlistenable. Then it gets better, but still with misfires by Prince and Elvis Costello. The only great selection is k.d. lang's Help Me, followed by Emmylou Harris' The Magdalene Laundries and Cassandra Wilson's For the Roses, which is not enough quality to merit buying the CD or keeping it (I'm giving away the one I purchased). This was a good effort, but overall it fails.

[m]1- The assertion that the apparent incoherence of the Koran is due to the assumption that the pouring of the heavenly Koran (The uncreated Koran) into the earthly Koran represented by the Arabic language was like pushing a thousand Truths into dozens of alphabets and had to result in such incoherence and anachronism, is not only laughable to the secular mind but also offensive to the orthodox scholar Muslims. Hey perhaps the immense Energy-Momentum Tensor associated with the huge satellite transmition resulted in Riemann-Christoffle tensor that caused such space time warp2-The saying that Islam resulted in science movement is rather a historical mistake. At the time of Caliph Ummar when Egypt was conquered, he ordered his appointed governor to burn the Library of Alexandria on the ground that it was either contradicting the book of Allah { Koran ) or superflous to it. And As the historian Well noted (in his book short history of the world), it was only until the notion of the self-sufficiency in the Koran was set aside that Science started to flourish in the Arab empire. Indeed it was the caliph Maamoon who adopte the view that the Koran is just words any Arab can write the like thereof. Maamoon put obnoxious fundamenal shieks - insisting that Koran un created - in jails. Mammon enocurage Sience gave the jewish translators gold in weigh of what they translated from Greek to Arabic. Al-Khwarizmi,who gave Algebra its name, was a close friend to Maamon.3- About the right of Women in Islam, that is also another misleading in the book. Of all the enemy and critic of Islam write, there is an incident no one - up to my kwoledge - has yet written about. Here is it: If man accuse another man or a woman of adultery and cannot bring another three acceptable 3 men witnesses , he must be lashed 80 times. However a husband can accuse his wife of adultery even if he cannot produce another three acceptable men witnesses. He just has to swear five times that she commited the act. Now she either addmit and face punishments or deny and swear five times that she didn't and he is lying :"And for those who launch a charge against their wives, and have (in support) no evidence but their own,- let one of them testify four times by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth; "And the fifth (oath) (should be) that he solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on himself if he tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth." 24:6-9 Koran Yousef Ali translation. The drama does not end here. after the divorce the man can go and get marriage. The woman NOT. According to the Islamic legislation, she must wait until Alah shows a sigen that her huband was lying. The sigen could be as a disease that hits him...etc. Of course that doesn't happen in islamic society today.4- The author also try to accomodate that the Koran and the Bible are both right. If two things are contradicting, only two conclusion are possible: 1-) One is false 2-) Both are false. An Arab poet, Al-Maary, who was 300 years after Muhammad, once said:Corruption is people's first natureAnd in hallucination all religions are equal

[g]Just with all of Hart's books this book cover is misleading.You look at the cover and think I'm really going to learn something and you read the book and get disappointed.He only shows the finnished step.He doesn't show the steps on how to get to the finnished step.Instead of describing how he draws it he gives you a history on each car.I'm sorry but telling a person the car history doesn't show them how to draw the car.I'm starting to think that Hart's books aren't very good.

[m]This book didn't teach me how to draw cars!What it did show me was art work from talented car artists.Showing me artwork will not teach me how to draw a car.

[m]I am unfortunately not as familiar with Roth's earlier works and previous reviewers, though I have read him, knew of him, and respected him as one of America's great writers. I was nonetheless excited to discover this motherlode of observation, perception and wisdom that deigns touch upon such complicated and socially sensitive matters as race, academic culture, contemporary social pyrotechnics, vietnam, and simply surviving the murk of daily living. As an African American, it was a very pleasant surprise to discover the implicit wisdom of Roth's dissection of what it must be like, or entail, to cross the color line. Roth explores the subject matter with a wisdom and sensitivity and, more importantly, and insigtfulness that is rather staggering. Should I add, for an outsider? But perhaps that is the implicit lesson of the book; that though we may be positioned as outsiders in viewing arcane matters dealing with other races, cultures and societal segments, we may not be at all--that the human stain that brushes against all of us, gives us insight into the plight, the problems, and the possiblilities of the rest of us. Roth's novel is excellent, entertaining and rewarding reading.

[m]Putting this together required some problem solving skills as the instructions were a little vague when it came to what side is up/down, in/out etc. It also came with plastic dowels instead of wood....first time I've seen those. How much did that save them? Ten cents? Even though it was A.P.I.T.A. to put together it looks pretty good on the wall.

[m]I got this album about 6 to 7 years ago and I initially didn't like it. I thought it was because the good songs were the radio singles and the rest were fillers or that maybe I had to give some songs some time to sink in. Well nope.In the last two years since I started playing two instruments I've learned to appreciate real songs and how they're put together and looking back at this album it's still crap. I expected to hear songs with background music along the lines of say my name, independent woman pt 2, or from the last destiny's child album, cater 2 u, lose my breath, etc but the radio singles and the other songs on the album are like day and night. The main problem is the background music on the other songs are very bland and lack any real arrangements or diversity in instruments used in the songs. Also there were too many slow songs and not enough faster more upbeat songs and even the slow songs lacked life.If you really want to know whether to buy the cd or not. Go on youtube and listen to the songs there and if you like them then buy the album.

[m]This book was chosen as one of my book group reads and I must admit about groaning before starting it and going into it with a biased view. I do not like Clint Eastwood movies and associated this book with a Clint Eastwood movie (even though I haven't even watched it) so I thought it would be everything I hated about an old fashioned, bodice swelling love story.I could not have been more off the ball on this. I could not help compare the book to the classic book, Love Story by Erich Segal as it was set over a short period, it was pithy and to the point. I thought the writing style was just divine as it flowed like a chocolate fountain and was so descriptive that I could picture each location as if I were there myself. I am so glad he kept it short and to the point as it did not allow all the unnecessary sloppiness that is usually inserted in these types of novels and it kept it true to the short time period (a few days) that the love element actually happened.I have a confession! I actually shed a tear and felt my heart breaking for the two main characters as I so wanted a happy outcome for them, even many years later. I usually hate happy endings but this is one book that I wanted to have one. I wasn't actually disappointed though that it didn't have a happy ending as the actual ending was just true to the overall story. Sorry can't say more as do not want to insert a spoiler.So, a pleasant surprise from my original bias and a movie I now want to watch. I guess I will try and get the book group together after the discussion to watch it. 5 out of 5 from me and if it can make a cynic like me cry then everyone else will be weeping buckets of tears!

[m]These live on our fridge door and quite frequently I will find my 2 year old sitting in front of the fridge just going through her numbers. A great distraction when one is trying to cook the family dinner. I originally put them out when she was just over one year old but that was too early as she chewed on them (and she is not generally a chewer) so I put them away. No problems when I reintroduced them at about 18 months old.An easy way to continue teaching in a fun way while still getting on with other chores.

[m]One of my main criticisms when I am reading and reviewing books is that sometimes I struggle with a particular vernacular. If it is written with a heavy Southern or Negro vernacular then I find it hard to get into the story and I am often tempted to give up as I am not enjoying the book. See my review on Go Tell it on the mountain by James Baldwin if you need an example.So, it was with this in mind that I chose this book as this months read for one of my book groups. I wanted the others to get some sort of understanding of what I mean when I say I struggle with certain American dialects.Written entirely in my birth dialect of Glaswegian it does take a couple of chapters, even for me to get into the rhythm of this book. It must have been an extremely hard book to write doing so entirely in Glaswegian without even any descriptive paragraphs in plain English. I am quite impressed with the authors ability to do this as it would have been quite easy to just keep the conversations in Glaswegian while putting descriptive paragraphs in simpler terms.The story itself is not a classic but it does have some depth and meaning below the surface, although some of that may be lost with people struggling to understand the language. I felt quite sad for the characters in the end. Although there was an element of happiness, I just thought that they would never be quite the same again and that there would always be a sadness in their minds for various reasons (trying not to give away a spoiler).One criticism is that, despite the title, I thought it did not go into Buddhism enough or indeed Jimmy's journey in and out of it. I felt that the whole side story with Anne Marie and Nisha and the CD was unnecessary and I would have liked more about Jimmy himself. I know that the point of the whole Anne Marie story, was probably to show how for a 12 year old, life just goes on no matter what is happening with her parents and that she is, blissfully, unaware of all the drama that Jimmy and Liz is going through. Credit to her parents for shielding her from it all though.A good read to help me prove a point to my book group and one that does make one think but it is no classic or must read for everyone. 4 out of 5.To end I want to write out a Scottish toast that you should give before eating or drinking:Here's Tae Us; Wha's Like Us?.........Damn Fewand they're a' deid!

[m]I purchased this set about 5 years ago and, in spite of it being expensive IMHO, I have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and overall problem-free operation. In fact, except for the batteries now only holding charge for about 5 days, I have had no issues with it. Another thing I like is the handsets are just about the right size, at least for someone with small hands like mine. Not too big or small.Entering phone book entries was a little tedious but this tedium was balanced by being able to copy entries to the second phone at the simple push of a button, thereby eliminating the need to do it twice. Someone was thinking on this feature.My use was confined mostly to inside the house and in the garage on occasion and I experienced no signal drop or garbled conversations. In spite of what the manual says, I believe it is impractical to expect the device to operate properly over the length of a football field-just my opinion.My only complaint, now that I am getting rid of my land line and selling this unit, is deleting the entries. Instead of having a "Delete all entries" feature, they have to be deleted one-by-one-and you have to do the same thing on each phone. Someone was definitely not thinking about this one. That is why I gave it 4 stars. I would still recommend it.

[m]You'd think the first 007 movie ['Dr No'] would have been the undeniable best but it is not. The best one is 'Goldeneye', 'You Only Live Twice, 'Goldfinger' and 'The World is Not Enough' all in sequential order. Dr No has a weird beginning as is the only Bond film without the classic opening shot with Bond as he takes a gun and shoots it as the screen then quickly turns red. It is also the only one without Q, still is a great movie but not all suspenceful but filled with plot.

[m]I may be a bit biased in my opinion, but this is by far one of the most captivating and immersing games I have ever played (and I've played most of them since the mid 90s!). I have multiple accounts with more 50s than I can shake a stick at (over 30 at this point). I have been playing since 10 OCT 01 (Day One) and this game STILL holds my attention.- They don't "technically" raise the level cap with each expansion.- ToA was a disaster, but that has been severely nerfed at this point that it's much more trivial than ever.- There are actual Rewards and consequences to RvR! This game has by far the best RvR (PvP) system out there!If you are ever on Tintagel/Hibernia, feel free to look me and my guild up (Armyn ab Treanid).

[m]In a nutshell, the book's thesis is, "My political views are so obviously correct that anyone who doesn't accept them just has to be nuts." It presupposes the truth of a right-wing political outlook and then tries to plumb the reasons why other people do not accept this truth, the conclusion being that they have to be in massive denial.Joan Swirsky, a fan of the book, notes that it "avoids all the usual psychobabble." I hazard to propose that this is because the book does not contain any actual psychological science.

[m]Morricone is simply brilliant, and it is never more obvious than here on The Mission.Derivative? Repetitive? Yes, and again, yes (see, that was derivative 'caused I stole from another review, and repetitive 'cause i answered... twice). But that's not only OK, it's almost required! And they told you, too, before you paid a penny! Go ahead, look- it's right there, hiding in plain sight. The rest of the class can wait quietly with their heads down on their desks.Waiting..."Original Soundtrack From The Motion Picture"!!! Come on kids- it's a soundtrack from a film, and films are derivative, and repeat symbolism and, well, just come on! It's a soundtrack to a motion picture, and as such it is among the top soundtracks ever.Yes, and again, yes: it IS among the top soundtracks ever! Why? Simple- it does its job, and it does it well. Without its soundtrack "The Mission" wouldn't be nearly as great a film as it is; it amplifies the emotion and sentiment of each scene while acknowledging the environment and remembering the historical origins of the subject matter, and even seems to keep things moving along (in a film I've sometimes thought could have gone a bit long otherwise).More than anything else, though, the brilliance of this soundtrack strikes when you hear it years after last seeing "The Mission" and suddenly it hits like a flood- all the emotion, how overwhelming these men's obstacles were, how visually stunning the environment was and how graceful death can be... how horrific life can be...All these years later I hear "Gabriel's Oboe" and it just takes my breath away.It's a soundtrack to a motion picture, and as such it is nothing short of brilliance, and Morricone a genius.

[m]This is the only non-prescription nightguard that has worked for me. In fact, it works better than the $500 nightguard that my dentist made for me. I've tried several other low-priced nightguards, and they were either uncomfortable or left me sore in the morning. This one is adjustable, and pliable, so there are no sharp edges and it fits my mouth exactly. And the price is right.

[m]I purchased this with fond memories of the film, which I know well, and watched it with a friend who had not seen the movie before. As reported, much of the film is too dark to make out what's going on, so I had to explain to my friend what was transpiring on screen. In essence, all the night scenes are in total blackness (in the original, there was enough light to see the action), and even some of the other scenes are also difficult to make out entirely. Shame on the releasing company for putting out this classic film in this sorry condition.

[g]Early on the authors of this book let us know their extreme disdain for Christianity. This didn't bother me at first, though I am a believer in Yahushua/Jesus. It is always good to get more than one perspective. But the constant sarcastic put downs of Christianity, and the presentation of themselves as understanders of the Gospel and it's impetus in history, got to be annoying really fast. Baigent & Leigh think they are knowledgeable, they present themselves as objective scholars, but they are actually very biased.It appears to me that their operating principal goes something like this: "The supernatural stories of Jesus Christ are totally mythological [this belief they cannot resist emphasizing over and over, tiresomely] i.e., lies. We know this because we assume a priori that the supernatural as it is presented in Scriptures does not exist and because we are beings who have vastly superior intellect to that of Christians. Therefore...we don't have to be too careful about our understanding of the Gospels, and can with impunity present ourselves as if we are experts on it, even though we are not at all - because you see, it's all nonsense and doesn't matter anyway!"This type of intellectual dishonesty and sloppy thinking - like for example claiming that Paul was the first one to start worshipping Yahushua (hello, how about the first chapter of John, and the Apostle Thomas bowing before His feet and saying, "My Lord/Adonai and my Elohim/God" - duh) made me realize I couldn't take seriously any "scholarship" these two have to offer. When it comes to the Dead Sea Scrolls there is so much controversy. Why should I trust these sloppy, dishonest thinkers, to tell me the real truth? Answer: I didn't and I don't.There is some purely objective fact to be found in the book - most of it known very well already. If you haven't heard those parts already, you can find them on the internet and save the money.

I have had to go back to it a few times to remind myself why I don't need or like smoking anymore.

[g]When I first saw this book, I thought to myself, "Uh oh. Hacks trying to make a quick buck by re-writing a chapter from his classic "About Face"!". Perhaps he was was doing just that, but he created a gem anyhow!For those that dont know, David Hackworth made a name for himself in the Vietnam War by figuring out a cost effective way of fighting the enemy that could have lead to US victory. Unfortunately, nobody would listen to him. This book focuses on Hack's third tour in Vietnam when he commanded a down and out infantry battalion in the Mekong Delta. After instilling some discipline in this pack of sullen draftees, he turned them into a winning combat team. He also rewrote their tactics. Instead of headlong and pointless search and destroy missions, Hack sat back and watched the battlefield and waited for the Communist enemy to trip up. When that happened, he poured every resource available into them and utterly crushed some of the best Viet Cong units in existence. When he turned over command, his unit racked up a 100 to 1 or so kill ratio. A ratio the enemy could not take.In this book, Hackworth shows how he did this. He also reveals significant obstacles he had to overcome. Besides inheriting a low quality unit, he had to deal with idiot superiors (in particular the Division commander GEN Ewell and Deputy Commander COL Ira Hunt). Reading how he got over these problems is a real treat.I believe this book is best suited for the historian wanting to better understand the Vietnam War. It is less useful for the aspiring junior military leader. I say this because much of what COL Hackworth did to succeed went directly against the wishes of his superiors and occasionally against military regulations. Hack could get away with this as he was rising star in the Army. The average leader trying to do much of what he did would wind up getting cashiered.I shaved off one star for filler. There are two chapters in this book dealing with the battalion medics and his soldiers' sexual proclivities. While both chapters are very interesting, they dont fit into the big picture all that well. Other than this, the book is a keeper.

[m]Lyn Crost was a war correspondent for a Hawaii based newspaper. Not surprisingly, much of her work focused on the 100th Battalion/442d Regimental Combat Team which were filled with Japanese-Americans from Hawaii. She also became somewhat of an advocate for them after the war. This book is part of that advocacy.I was excited to find a book which appeared to conduct a comprehensive review of the war record of Japanese-American servicemen during World War II. Crost reveals in nice detail the little discussed activities of Nisei interpreters and intelligence specialists in the Pacific Theater. However, I found the chapters dealing with the all-Japanese combat units in Europe unreadable. These portions were tedious and annoying. This was caused mostly by Crost delving no deeper into actions beyond noting particular acts of heroism by certain Nisei Soldiers and concluding with which medal they received.Another problem is shoddy research in areas not directly related to the Nisei experience. Examples of this is a contention the Japanese could have used an occupied Hawaii to send planes to bomb the US Mainland (they had no planes with sufficient range) and a complaint German and Italian immigrants didn't receive the same treatment as their Japanese counterparts (patently false!).If you're considering purchasing this book, try to get a copy out of a library first. I wish I had!

[m]I bought this for my unfinished basement, as I was concerned about the closed ventilation there. The second night I had this up and running it went off with a loud tone.With that I opened all the windows and the basement door, and after awhile it stopped beeping. The next day I had the AC guy come in, and apparently there was something wrong with our pipe connections.Without my detector we could have run into a real bad scenario.I am glad I purchased it, and feel like everyone should have them in their household. These detectors save lives.

[m]I've been reading and enjoying fantasy for many years, and am neither young nor stupid. This book, put simply, was horrific. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

[m]Peacock was DEEPLY brutally honest, vulnerable and "real" long before it was in fashion. This album is incredible, the music is ... well timeless sounds cliche, but TIMELESS and the lyrics are deep and intense.The song Forgiveness is so wildly good, listening to it is an "activity." I can't do anything else at the same time. It's one of those songs that you feel like running around and playing for everyone just so they feel it.What a brilliant musician - what a "real" Christian - what a testimony to what the Holy Spirit can do with a mere man.

[m]I had a Nokia 3595 before and it was a lot simpler to use. But this sony ericsson has a lot new features that I never had, like the camera, internet, and instant messaging (all of which i don't use.)I was going to buy the t616 but it was more expensive than this one. I think the t616 is more aesthetically appealing, but this phone is slightly smaller.I got this phone because I wanted something with Bluetooth to sync with my Apple Powerbook's Address book. This phone did the job, but it doesn't let you store that many phone numbers per person. Like for a few people I had over 5 numbers for them (Work, College, Home, Weekend home, etc...) and the phone only keeps 3 and ditches the rest. =/I agree with the other guy who said the default ringtones are strange, they are! But thanks to bluetooth, you can easily download new ones and themes as well onto your computer and then transfer them to your computer. And you don't have to pay extra for these.I miss my nokia, but I gave this a four because bluetooth just rocks. It's more confusing as first, but you get used to it pretty quick.MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT - however - is that it's NOT loud. [I have turned off increasing ring, volume @ loudest] My nokia was VERY loud and I could hear it ring when I'm in the middle of city and there's traffic, buses, and whatnot blaring their horns. Also, the vibrations are not as strong as the Nokia's. I can barely feel it in my pocket vibrating.I also work at a computer and my ears are plugged into my ipod. I rely on my phone to be loud, but it's not. =/Oh well, other than that, it's a GREAT phone :)

[m]This is another one of those movies that you either love or you hate. I seem to be in the minority. As a fan of musicals I was looking forward to the film, and definitely to the rebirth of the movie musical. I was quite disappointed by this film though. First, it represents everything that is bad about postmodernism. The quick cut editing (a la MTV and Michael Bay) doesn't lend itself to a musical - or at least a traditional musical) and before you say it isn't a traditional musical (which I realize), understand that musicals rely on staging for effect. The director is so quick to change the shot or angle before the audience gets bored that he never allows the actors to truly perform. At times it becomes even cartoonish and while an accurate approximation of a vaudville musical, it's hard to generate any sympathy for Nicole Kidman or to even begin to care about the love story when Baz doesn't care enough to develop the characters beyond two dimensions. With only one original song, the soundtrack sounds like a well done greatest hits of pop songs with elaborate orchestration. Kind of like The Boston Pops does KIIS 97 FM (The best hits of the seventies, eighties, and nineties). While Luhrman certainly has an eye (reminiscent of Terry Gilliam in many ways) it doesn't lend itself to a musical - and without his help this production (as beautiful as it is) collapses under its own weight.

[m]I never saw this film in theaters. The reason I didn't was because the critics seemed to hate it so much I didn't want to waste my money. The other day, I rented it when I was standing at the video store and it was one of the only things left. I am so glad that I rented this film. I'll most likely go and buy it sometime next week. And here's why:With a resin-caked genius, the guys in the comedy troupe Broken Lizard have made what is one of the most enjoyable and consistently funny films of recent years. It doesn't suffer from the third act unfunnyness that other comedies suffer when they sacrifice laughs and an established pace in favor of trying to wrap up a plot that wasn't that great in the first place. (A good example of this? How about the sometimes painfully bad ending to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - or any other movie where the plot and/or subplot love interest get in the way of comedy.) Here, although there is a love interest and there is a cohesive plot, one needent worry because these elements don't detract from the film at any point. Instead, the film keeps its spirit and pace going - never stopping to take ANYTHING seriously. There are very few gags here that don't work and if you're a fan of the aforementioned Jay & Silent Bob or Dude Where's My Car - this stoner comedy will most likely work for you. The film opens with a scene lifted out of Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke - with a nice twist or two - and manages to maintain the energy throughout the film. Also, Brian Cox is brilliant as the head of the delinquent State Trooper post. So for fans of pot humor or films like Caddyshack or the original M*A*S*H* - this is surely a film you will enjoy. If you aren't a friend of the pot movies though - this film might make you wish you would have bought Serendipity instead.

[m]Look, this movie is one of those movies that you watch and at first your like wtf is going on here? Then you show it to a friend, then another, and then, before you know it, you are screaming its praises from the mountaintop. It has everything you want in a movie. Prisoner dong - check. Live action adaptation of Pac Man directed by a Swedish director and filmed in a fish restaurant - check. Courtroom scene filmed in an empty indoor swimming pool - checkitycheck. Girls on their period. Yes indeed.Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. Buy a VCR first because this will never end up on DVD. Because the world is unfair like that.

[m]This was still an enjoyable story and certainly worth the time.No, it's not about the SEALS but still showcases some interesting characters and tells a good tale. The conversations between Jax and his fictional character are a bit strange but once you get used to the idea, it's not so bad. This was a unique perspective and did give more insight into how the main character was feeling. I'd buy the book again...

[m]Karen Robards delivers the 'can't put it down' type of story-line that makes me wish she could write a book like this every month. Classic plot line with several clever twists to keep the reader guessing and a real surprise ending. You'll never guess who the Beachcomber is. This is a can't miss choice.

[m]Arrived in a timely manner. 8% is a bit strong for use. Instructions are included to cut it down to 3% for use on scratches and open cuts on the body. I use it to brush teeth. It kills the bacteria on the teeth and mouth sores... Do Not swallow it... Rinse mouth after use... Food Grade doesn't have the heavy metals for stabilizers as the drug store type does.. Must be kept in the ice box.Many books on Amazon on use of H2O2.Update 10/2011: Don't use to (3%HP) brush teeth if you have fillings. Don't know for sure, but the 3% might effect the glue used to hold fillings in.... But, I spray my tooth brushes before used to kill bacteria.Also, discovered that using 3% SPRAYED ON joint rash (sticky kind) dries it up and takes away the sting.... Works also on under arm odor.Great for killing mold. There is a yellow mold that gets on the bath room sink and shower due to the super efficient water softener and filter system (takes out all the chlorine).

[m]Works as advertised. I have used it now for about two months. Be sure to move the line side ways when rewinding. Keep the line form jamming..The line is strong. I use it on the back enclosed patio for bed sheets (one set at a time)works fine. I use the line for all of my stuff to save using the dryer. Power and gas is getting expensive. The girls still use the dryer because girl stuff has to dried a certain way (I guess).A nice side note: The line retracts and is hidden when not in use. It is illegal to have an outside line where I live, go figure that in the days of high energy costs.

[m]This gets the job done but there's better designs available.The tank is angled the top which means it won't sit flat in the sink when you're trying to fill it up. The fill hole is only slightly larger than what you'd find on a soda bottle, so you can't fill it up quickly in the tub. The small opening also means it doesn't dry out quickly.For reasons beyond all understanding, they put in a very bright light you can't turn off. If you want to use it in a bedroom, you might have a hard time sleeping with it on.It's pretty quiet but definitely louder than other ultrasonic vaporizers I've used.Overall I would look at one of the Vicks units instead.

[m]This product came very quickly after ordering it--long in time for a baby shower. The item was on a registry, so it is just what the parents-to-be asked for. The color is great, and the space saver chair is a great idea!

[m]So we bought this movie because we really like those two actors from Flight of the Conchords and Hitchhiker's Guide. And it's the scenes with Chevalier and Bronco/Brutus that are the only good bits of the movie. The rest is completely forgettable.

[g]These smoke alarms looked like a good buy, but when we tried to install them (using a manual screwdriver), the screw heads broke off in our ceiling, leaving the shanks embedded in the wood. We removed them with pliers (with some difficulty) and then installed the alarms with new screws of our own. The poor qualilty of the screws caused us an unreasonable amount of extra work and frustration. We have not had the alrarms long enough to comment on their longevity.

[g]If you haven't read this book, but you've read a bunch of the reviews you are probably thinking that this is one book that maybe you would like to skip since there are plenty of negative reviews. I gave this one 2 stars, not because of the "visual sound effects" or because of poor editing (ummm... a trademark of fantasy happens to be high-word count pastoral/medieval backgrounded tomes). I gave it 2 stars because nothing really happens in the book. Really. I think there is some "action" late in the 300's or so, but the majority of the book contains a long pony ride by the main character and his struggles with figuring out magic. (He is not alone in the struggle, as it seems both author and reader also struggle with it, too).But the book is far from wasted time. There are some really good elements that are atypical of fantasy reads. The character Lerris is actually rather unique and the reader will have sympathy for him. Most of the other characters, however, are written in the same tone - as if the author was unable to create multiple unique characters. Still, its not a tedious read and it is not a Tolkien re-tread.

[m]I tolerated Odd Thomas, and I made it through that book. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for By the Light of the Moon.Someone gave this book to me for Christmas; otherwise I wouldn't have even picked it up. I attempted to read it, and was completely bored. Fact it - it's dull.There are a lot of Dean Koontz fans out there, but I am not one of them. I won't be making the mistake of reading another one.If I could have given this book 0 stars, I would have done that.

[m]I respect all of you who have rated this book so highly, but I just don't see it. I live a short drive across Mobile Bay from the center of the action of The Poet of Tolstoy Park, and I certainly would like to say that I enjoyed the book. I bought this book to support a local author and hopefully enjoy a good, highly recommended book.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Usually, I can tell within about three pages whether or not I will like a book. With this one, it took about three paragraphs to know that this book just isn't my style.I'm sure it's a great book for people who enjoy that sort of book, but it did nothing for me.Please don't take my review only - the trends for The Poet of Tolstoy Park certainly are promising, and I hope Sonny Brewer does well. I did like the foreword from the author, but I did not enjoy the book.

[m]Joe Finder has written another fascinating book in "Company Man".One thing I find slightly amusing about Mr. Finder is his background in intelligence vs his writing about corporate life. Interesting.On to the book.Company Man is a brilliant page-turner about a small-town company CEO who finds himself in the middle of forced job cuts due to the company's acquisition, the loss of his wife in a very little mentioned car accident, and a stalker.How Nick Conover, the CEO, evolves and deals with all the situations surrounding him, as well as all the twists of fate, will keep you interested and keep you guessing!Enjoy this wonderful work by Joe Finder!

[m]I purchased the Black and Decker F1060 which is designed exactly like the F1000. It is a great iron with lots of nice features WHEN it is together. However, the top pops off the iron. There are clips holding it in to the clear plastic area that holds the water. I am not sure if it pops off just from the heat or if it is because when you turn the dial setting it can cause it to pop off if you turn it slightly past where you should stop. It is not hard to turn it too far. My husband has re glued it twice and maybe that has messed up the settings but I iron a lot of calico since I quilt and want the setting on the highest for cotton. So when turning all the way to the highest setting you can easily turn it too far and therefore it comes apart. Poor design.

[m]I leave it to others to rate this novel, but I believe that this, my 45th novel, is the finest short fiction I have written. It is about a courageous editor, Angie Drum, who discovers that her own son, the mayor of a Kansas cowtown, is corrupt. She chooses to expose him and his cronies, at great anguish to herself. Her moral courage and determination lie at the heart of the story.The cover depicts three armed gunmen, but do not be misled. There are no gunfights in this story. The Hollywood West does not exist in this novel. It is simply a story of a woman of great spiritual beauty wrestling with her conscience, and in the end, doing what is right, at terrible cost.I am grateful to Amazon for letting me provide an accurate description of the novel for the benefit of readers and customers.

[m]This lady is prolific and appears to maintain a high standard throughout her works. I enjoyed The Villa, the good dialogue, the facts of wine making, and the portraits of several weak, evil men. Fortunately, she balances those losers with some winners. Sophia Giambelli is a high-powered PR person for her family business; her prowess in her trade is almost unbelievable, yet I went along. Why not? Tyler MacMillan is rugged, attractive, and devoted to growing good grapes. The matriarch is La Signora, always addressed as such by her employees, her husband is Tyler's grandfather. Plots to sabotage the product and murder abound. I look forward to my next read of Nora Roberts; she is worth my time.

[m]Mary Karr deserves her PEN award and more. She manages the trick of speaking like an earthy seven-year-old in adult terms, and details her life with a maniacal mother and "low-rent," goodhearted father in a manner to make your head spin. Yet Mary and her older sister Lecia do not grow up to be mental cases (or do they?). Mother pickles her liver with fervor and at one point loses her mind and is institutionalized briefly. Father hangs on and cares for his girls and regales the Liars' Club with amusing, tall stories. This seems to be his only amusement. We see Lecia as a mature nine-year-old and Mary as a precipitous one and somehow the two of them weather the turmoil of their home life.As almost a sideline, Mary reveals that father is mother's fifth or sixth husband, and mother goes on to acquire another after Mary's and Lecia's father. The cause of these seemingly casual marriages are revealed at the end and it is a pathetic and hopeless one. Later, as an adult, Mary's voice is subtly changed and her writing images are no less captivating.

[m]I haven't finished the book, tho I am enjoying it & will surely finish it. I am listening to an audiobook, my favorite type of reading.Dinah decides on a whim in the middle of the morning to drive to Atlanta (from Charleston). She tries to find Bobby but, alas he has returned to Charleston for the night. Dinah then drives back to Charleston. She arrives the same day AND she gets home in time to watch 3 hrs of TV before her mother plots for her to go out with Cord that night. Now that is some day! No model of car was mentioned, but I'm thinking Formula One.I hate it when authors don't know the territory of which they write...and then editors don't catch geography errors. This isn't some typo, Charleston and Atlanta are over 300 miles apart by car. 600 miles in no time. What a drive!

[m]This book is about Elena who is a werewolf. She decides to live in the big city and get away from the pack and try to live a normal life. Her current boyfriend has no idea she is a werewolf and things seem to be working out ok until: she gets a call to come back to the pack for an emergency.She does return and her life is in much turmoil while she is there. She finds things out about herself that she has been afraid to admit.There is action, a good plot and a nice romantic twist to the book. I liked the book a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal (werewolf) stories with romance.

[m]I have read every one of Diane Chamberlain books and she is my favorite author. I have found no other author to compare to her style, and really loved all her previous books (except Brass Ring). This one fell really short for me, it dragged, and was so predictable. I didn't care for the characters, and honesly, I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through the book and just skimmed ahead to the end. Sorry Diane. I will buy your next book....please write in your "old style" - those were absolutely thrilling. Can't wait for the next book.

[m]The Clippers are very sharp and my dog has black nails. I accidently clipped too close the last time I was doing his nail. I felt awful about it, but it wasn't the clippers fault they are exellent and do their job quickly and easily.

[m]I found this Miniseries very thoughtful, incise, and beautifully written. I know they took some liberties with the truth, but what historical drama doesn't?I loved the crotchedly Adams who felt that politics were awful unless he was agreed with. I loved the relationship between Adams and his wife, who in an era were women were not often educated and were never expected to have an opinion, is a pistol and a person of very strong views and she was not afraid to disagree with her husband.

[m]I have not noticed any difference in my dog since I started giving him this product. I do understand that different calming products don't work for every pet, it's a matter of trial and error. This was an error for my dog and I'll be trying again with a different product this month.

[m]Ditto with everything "Shucker" stated in her review. This is the best nursing bra I've come across. I wish I'd known about it for my first child. It's extremely supportive both as a bra and during nursing. The opening is such that there's no need to hold or prop your breast in order to nurse. This is a HUGE plus for those of us who are bustier. The sizing is a bit off as I found the cups run a tad bigger. However, I just ordered a cup size smaller and it fit perfectly. This is not a sexy bra, ladies, but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in function. The only negative comment I have is that the clasp is difficult to open and close with one hand. All in all, this is the best bra for the bustier mom!

[m]Couldn't agree more with everyone else's sentiments here regarding the two buffoons in the bar. Those cutscenes are AWFUL. Not to mention the perfectly poured glasses of beer on the counter and Lenny Clarke's HIDEOUS outfit.That being said, every Red Sox fan should see this. It fills a need to document what was simply one of the greatest sports dramas ever witnessed.If I had my druthers, I'd kind of like to see something spanning the whole 7 games. I think it would set the stage a bit better overall.And you know what else-why doesn't Damon's grand slam in game 7 get more play? That was the single greatest moment for me. Game 7 was a bit anti-climactic, but you didn't know that in the 2nd inning. Does anyone remember that the Yanks brought in a new pitcher and Damon hit the FIRST PITCH out? Sweet, sweet justice that was.

[m]While it is capable of producing an exciting "sound," Williams' music lacks the depth and originality found in truly timeless work. His fanfares provide the listener with a certain Pro tem, but as time passes so has Williams'. He gave us something inventive in the 70s, when he was at his creative peak. Today, is it difficult to discern which is more indifferent, the music or the listener? What about the many fans of Williams, myself included? He is my reason for studying music. Nevertheless, like the composer, we should stop screaming from center stage. Fellow music lovers, if you keep buying albums, they will keep hiring the same composer. Allow a newer composer, an unheard "voice," to speak.

[g]I give this book 4 stars, even though I found some of the descriptions just too much. Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka look like the ideal couple next door, but the reality is far from that. Paul is a sexual sadist and it can never really be actually proven if Karla herself is just as sick as her husband or if it's all a result of the horrible abuse and brainwashing she has endured over the years by him. Although you can't help feel sorry for the unbelievable treatment and horror Karla has endured, you can't help and wonder if early on when the relationship started getting weird or when he first hit her, had she stopped the relationship then, if all three young women's deaths may not have been saved, if not all three then at least her own sister, Tammy's and Karla herself would not have had to endure what she had, as well as being sent to prison. I was actually looking forward to this book ending, cause the cruelty and depravity Paul exhibited was just too much. All though, you can see how Paul's childhood and adolescence led to this, how Karla's upbringing resulted in what it did, makes one believe she really may have been a victim just as Tammy, Leslie, and Kristen were. All in all, this is a good true crime story, but very graphic and violent. A heavy dose of romance novels are now in store for me after reading "Deadly Innocence."

[m]House of Sand and Fog is not an uplifting movie -it is a tragedy. And true to all tragedy, the flaws in each character ultmately bring about their doom. But in addition to this, the film explores what the concept of &quot;home&quot; means; as a physical location, and an emotional effigy.Jennifer Connelly plays a self-absorbed, depressed woman, who has a history of unstable relationships, especially with men. She inherits a beach house from her father, only to lose it because of back taxes. Connelly never looks inside herself to discover the roots of her unhappiness -it is always someone else's fault. She externalizes her shortcomings, and stubbornly refuses to change. The lost beach house becomes an obsession to her, a symbol of everything the world has taken from her, everything she resolves to recover, using whatever means necessary, including manipulating a crooked cop into threatening the new tenants. She is lost, without a home, and not even content to be in her own skin. She is detatched, a &quot;foreigner&quot; so to speak, in her own land.Contrast this with Ben Kingsley's character, an Iranian immigrant who purchases the house on auction. He was wealthy and powerful in Iran -a prominant general in the Shah's military. Now he struggles to raise money by working multiple jobs, and constructing the pretense of wealth, in order to impress his Iranian friends. But more importantly, he doesn't want to lose his wife's admiration and esteem. The house for him, is the way to recover a lost life, the one he had to leave behind in Iran.Kingsley's character is a foreigner out of circumstance. Connelly is a foreigner out of choice. In a moving scene near the end of the film, the former general rescues Connely after she botches a suicide attempt, and just when the viewer thinks there may be a reconcilliation, or a happy ending, things deteriorate even more.And the house is just a modest bungalow, in need of some repair.The only thing I would change in this movie, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there is a scene where Connelly's character stands on the pier behind the house, as waves come crashing against it. She spins around in confused pirouettes, looking out into the ocean. It is in this moment she realizes there is no place for her, no &quot;home,&quot; because she has alienated herself from humanity, and brought catastrophe down on those who tried to help to her. The film should have ended right here, but it continues on, and thus loses some intensity.Perhaps the author tried to do a little too much with &quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; but a brilliant failure is always better than a mundane success.

[g]The 6th edition hardcover is a handsome book, filled with huge amounts of information. The method employed in this book is different than other instructional texts; it presents you with a vast number of grammatical rules early on, and then forces you to translate. It is a baptism by fire, and can be pretty challenging.However, the reading selections are delightful, many taken from Roman authors of the first century B.C. There is even some Horace to keep you on your toes.One thing you will need to do, is get the answer key from Harpers, since not every exercise in the book has one. This wasn't a problem for me -I simply emailed the publisher and they sent me the answer key. I had it within 4 days. If the key was included in the text, it would be 100 pages longer at least.If you are studying Latin, I also recommend the book "501 Latin Verbs" as another resource. If you are brand new to the language, you may want to start with the Cambridge Latin course, units 1 & 2, and then read the Wheelock's.

[g]V for Vendetta is ostensibly an action movie with political overtones. What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a "hip" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.The main character "V" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution. Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings. Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she "believes" in his political endeavors. All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder. It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes. At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference. In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal. The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester. Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film. It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on "Animal Farm." And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.So take a comic book and turn it in to a movie using the director that gave us the tower dung-heaps called "Matrix II & III." Some movies are provocative and disturbing in a good way -V for Vendetta is not one of them. [...]

[g]I'm currently using this for a freshman English course, and I find it is a complete mess. There are historical mistakes (claiming Cicero was the greatest writer of the Roman Empire -when Cicero wrote during the Republic), spelling errors, and even grammatical errors (take the title of Chapter 4 for instance: "Types of Synthesis: Explanatory and Argument" -has the author ever run into the term parallelism?).The book is full of redundancies and proprietary terminology. Some of the concepts are barely explained, others are beaten to death. The writing style is not consistent, leading to the suspicion that many people had their hands in this one -perhaps "authors" in India. Some of the exercises are barely comprehensible. For instance:"Look over the preceding readings and make a list of the ways they address the overall topics of computers, communication, and relationships. Make your list as detailed as you can. Then write several lists grouping together the readings that deal with similar aspects of the overall topics" (108).We really don't want our students writing like this, so the last thing we should do is expose them to a textbook like this.Some of the reading selections are good, and others are vapid, pointless, and generally worthless. Essays about dirty dorm rooms and lack of parking spaces behind the gym -oh yes, this is really provocative.I challenge anyone to find me a worse textbook.

[g]OK I'm updating this review again and I'm happy with the rating.I bought this from ToolsbyNet through Amazon and for under $180 with shipping = a great deal I thought. I saw the same model on online auctions for $70 more and just got a catalog from a major discount tool house in which it is $349.As I said originally, it's a great drill and appears to be very heavy duty except for the side handle which I don't use anyway. The only real problem arose after a year of occasionally driving screws and other medium duty work when I decided to try the hammer drill feature and drill some 1/2" holes in my concrete floor. It worked great for about 3 inches and then stopped. The motor overheated I think and just clicked for at least a couple of hours afterward when I tried it. A few days later, I cleaned it out and tried again and everything seems to be fine. If it was just overheating then it is probably good that it shut down but overheating after only 3 inches of concrete doesn't seem to be very heavy duty. New update: it died again. New update II: it has been another year now and a lot of hard use, no failures. One person commented that it must have been the batteries but I have two and tried both so it is not that. In any case whatever the hiccups were, I think that they are over and I really like the drill.

[m]In my employer's infinite wisdom, the powers-that-be bought these instead of the higher volume laser printers we used to have. For at least a year, maybe closer to 18 months, this little workhorse has valiantly done it's best to keep up, usually printing 100+ pages a day, every day, if not much more. It's never turned off.I am the one called on whenever there's a problem beyond changing cartridges. Most of those are wear and tear, permissions problems on this computer with its 16 users, or someone "accidentally" changed the wrong option. Because of this, when we got new XP computers I left it as a plug and play device. It worked well until I needed more features. It's a plain printer with few bells and whistles, though installing the drivers will add a few more features. The flat top is convenient as a shelf until I need to open it to change cartridges. However, it seems wider than it needs to be.Only now is it having paper handling issues. It rarely jams, but on about half the print jobs at least one sheet will not load correctly. Only a few lines get printed and the rest of the page prints on the next sheet. The rollers prefer to avoid picking up the last few pages in the cartridge, easily solved by loading more into it. I suspect that is a wear issue, but then it is quite over matched for the job anyway. I have used card stock, cheap paper, and high quality photo paper in it, all without additional problems.I mostly use "fast draft" and that really helps keep the ink consumption lower. Otherwise it's about average and has worked well with the refurbished cartridges "they" buy. With regular color cartridges, it can make nice photos, more than good enough to hang on the office wall. I'd imagine with an actual photo cartridge it might be better. Loading the ink is a bit easier than in my old HP 990 since the opening seems a bit bigger. I particularly like the "Black Text" option, which many others don't have.I am now buying one for my home, which is a much more suitable environment for it to begin with. It's far from perfect, but it's the best I've worked with in a while.

[m]I am the eternal beginner who walks into a guitar shop and badly plays the opening bars to Stairway to Heaven because it's the fanciest thing I know. Yes I know I would be banned in some shops. After innumerous tries at improving my playing skills in the past 45 years, I recently decided to take yet another stab at it. The biggest reason I never got beyond basic chords was the awful soreness in my left fingers from pressing the strings. I'd want to keep playing and practicing, but I'd have to put it down from the pain. That gets old really fast. Last time I really tried was many years ago. What did I know about string materials and weights?A couple of weeks ago, a friend broke an ancient string on my 70's Ventura dreadnought. I looked around and saw these here on Amazon. Silk? Really? (no) Light? (yes) Martin? (made in Mexico) On Sale? (oh yes) OK!Well, I am not putting my fingers directly on silk as I hoped, They're are on silver plated steel and the four lower strings are "Slvrpltd Copper on Nylon & Steel". But still!I might be able to get all the way through a first level teaching book this time and I'm just thrilled. These have been on my guitar for a whopping two days and I am very surprised how well they're working for me already. Every time I've picked it up it's barely gone out of tune - which I've never experienced with new strings that usually seem severely out of tune in minutes. I can put it down for the session not from pain, but with fingers still able to play. That's a first for meToo soon to tell how far I'll get this time, of course, but now without that pain my chances are higher than ever before. If you're a beginner, buy these, really.=============================================Update 12-2-2012These strings do seem to be life changing, since they've gotten me to really start playing guitar more seriously than ever before. I can now say these seem to be the ultimate beginner's strings. They helped me get really going with minimal finger tip pain. I played on them for quite a while, started classical guitar lessons about four months after the previous post and I am still taking them. Due to other pain issues, I am now playing a Telecaster that seems to suit my hands better than acoustic and classical guitars. But if I hadn't tried these strings, I really don't think I'd have gotten this far.

[g]The contrast on the films can be poor. Limited special features not necessarily related to the film on the disk. No way to display the time or what chapter you are watching. It seemed that no effort was taken to ensure a good print was used to master from. Gosh, I wish I had the money I had spent on these discs so I could get decent copies of these movies.
