B00COYOAYW,1,0,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,1,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,2,However, there are far more Android apps than Windows Phone apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,3,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,1,4,But, there are not many apps available...
B00COYOAYW,1,5,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,6,Not with Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,1,7,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,1,8,Windows 8 phones are terrific.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,1,10,its not android!
B00COYOAYW,1,11,windows 8 phones works really well.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,16,Android has over 800 thousand apps and games while Windows 8 only about 185 thousand.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,1,20,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,21,This ain't no android.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,Great Phone if you want to get the Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,This is like a downgrade, but it's not the end of the world.I really like this phone, I just don't know if I can get with the Windows world.

B00COYOAYW,5,9,I wish it had a front facing camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,10,The phone does not have a flash, but even if you take pictures in low light the camera will lighten the photo to make a great picture.
B00COYOAYW,5,11,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,13,It's a good phone with great features.

B00COYOAYW,5,23,The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,The only thing is that there isn't a front facing camera but still great!
B00COYOAYW,6,0,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,I don't even think I need this 8gb micro-sd card anymore.---Really
B00COYOAYW,6,6,Has an MicroSD card slot.9.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,storage options – 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,We had standard sim cards previously that are too big.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,The phone came and I converted my SIM card and it has been great ever since.
B00COYOAYW,6,11,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,After charging it, I needed to insert my SIM card from my old phone.The SIM Card:The SIM card slot is underneath the battery and smaller than the one I was using from a phone about 3 years old.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,very good phone for the money its t-mobile but i used 2 different pre-paid sim cards in it just to see if it would worked and it did.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,Tried a 32GB card, which worked.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,There's 8GB internal memory as well as microSD slot expanded memory.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,I previously owned a phone that utilized the larger SIM card; but, fortunately, the Lumia 521 included the new micro SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,I expected to be able to have massive storage on my micro-sd card, but the phone doesn't let you easily move/transfer/find/play music etc ... from the micro sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,You can put in a 64GB micro SD card and have a backup battery, those are the 2 important options not on a 925.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,Although it has a microsd expansion slot, you cannot move apps to the the sdcard.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,So far, this phone has worked very well for me.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,7,2,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,7,3,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,4,I like it more than my Samsung Galaxy.
B00COYOAYW,7,5,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,6,Many functions on the phone do not work.
B00COYOAYW,7,7,I have an iphone for my work phone and this phone does everything the iPhone does.
B00COYOAYW,7,8,This phone was everything we expected and in great condition for a used phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,9,I received this phone on time in great condition and loved it.
B00COYOAYW,7,10,For people looking to buy this phone should also look into galaxy from samsung
B00COYOAYW,7,11,It was here on time.

B00COYOAYW,7,15,nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,16,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,7,17,Ordered two and neither of them worked.
B00COYOAYW,7,18,And here it is, after using iPhone and Samsung galaxy, it surely a compromise, but with this prize, it's awesome deal.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,I had the iPhone and galaxy and this phone compares to them really well for the price
B00COYOAYW,7,20,It was very nice also...
B00COYOAYW,7,21,I received my new phone promptly and in perfect condition.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,Other than that it works perfect for me.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,great.
B00COYOAYW,7,24,Everything we expected.
B00COYOAYW,8,0,Good phone but wont work with service.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,3,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,8,4,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,8,5,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,IT WORKED!
B00COYOAYW,8,7,Once I got all these ducks in a row, the phone works like a charm!!
B00COYOAYW,8,8,T-mobile works well too.
B00COYOAYW,8,9,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,10,required phone services to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,they say the phone is unlocked but it was not.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,a only draw back is lock phone; it's very hard to unlock this phone if you did not purchase from T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,No need to unlock it.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,This is a great way to have a home phone and cell service on demand.
B00COYOAYW,8,18,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,to unlock the phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,Bought it for college and work.
B00COYOAYW,8,21,great phone great service.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,23,this is a great phone and work great.

B00COYOAYW,9,21,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,9,22,I wanted a phone which should be great in these 3 features and this phone is awesome in all of them1.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,Phone seems to be very fast, no lag time.
B00COYOAYW,9,24,Not as good as my Iphone or S3, If I rate Iphone and S3 as 100 and 96 then this would be a 85: as good as my BB Bold2.

B00COYOAYW,11,0,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,It has a tendency to change settings inexplicably.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,No silence button so you have to go through the settings function to silence and unsilence the ringer.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,The external buttons, especially the camera button, are just right.
B00COYOAYW,11,9,Love all the features and the large variety of ring tones and setting options.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,All though it has very good features, It turns itself on and off without even being touched.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,Very easy to see and user friendly.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,Hubby has customized his ringtones, lock screen, and the windows screen colors.

B00COYOAYW,11,18,The phone is pretty easy to set up.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,This is a good set.
B00COYOAYW,11,20,It is very user friendly and has functioned superbly.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,Buttons below the screen on the front: I'm very happy that all three buttons are capacitive rather than mechanical.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,camera button (hardware button on the side) has this half-way-press focus step and then all-the-way-down click.-
B00COYOAYW,11,23,If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,The camera is not that good.

B00COYOAYW,12,23,It works great.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,Great phone for the money.
B00COYOAYW,13,0,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,touch screen, i think $125 is satisfactory.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,The screen smudges pretty easily, but that can be fixed with a screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,I have added a screen protector and a protective case to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,The touch screen is pretty sensitive.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,I didn't have a case or screen protector yet so I was really worried about my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,13,11,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,I bought screen protector and phone back cover as suggested by Amazaon.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,The touch screen is super sensitive.
B00COYOAYW,13,17,I had the phone for about a month before I bought a screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Screen should be brighter and screen should not shut-off as quickly when plugged in.4.
B00COYOAYW,13,19,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger as indicated.The images for the phone clearly show a screen protector and car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,The phone was nice for a little while and even the case I bought with it was nice but less than the month the phone stop turning on.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,also suggest that you get a case because it scratches easily.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,I did buy a case for it soon after but failed to buy a screen protector at the same time.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,The screen is very responsive to touch.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,I was able to get a new phone, case, and screen cover all in a couple minutes.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,As for the apps I don't use that many apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,The app store is a FAR cry from the playstore, let me tell you.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many.
B00COYOAYW,14,6,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,7,Phone does all I need and has enough apps for anything I need as well.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store.
B00COYOAYW,14,9,They made the OS into an app.
B00COYOAYW,14,10,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,13,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,14,14,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,14,15,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,The App Store does not have as many apps as Android (I also own a Nook HD+ tablet that runs Android) or iOS have, but the most important apps are there.
B00COYOAYW,14,17,But I can't find any app like that on my phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,The apps are limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,20,You can find lots of apps comparable to apple apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,You can download an autoshoot app and there you have it.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,Also when I tried to download a app it didn't let me and I can't even download any apps at all which is sad.
B00COYOAYW,14,24,we do have instagram, vine and snapchat app in the store)
B00COYOAYW,15,0,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,1,Nokia Lumia 521 (T.

B00COYOAYW,15,3,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,4,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,Bought this for my 13 year old niece.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,I bought this phone for myself a few months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,I would love to buy the newest nokia lumia soon
B00COYOAYW,15,8,4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,9,Nokia Lumia 521 for T-mobile.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,Love My Nokia Lumia!!
B00COYOAYW,15,11,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,13,my nokia lumia 521.... tmobile.
B00COYOAYW,15,14,NOKIA LUMIA 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,15,IMO, Nokia got it right!
B00COYOAYW,15,16,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,18,This Nokia 521 seems to be a better phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,Which replaced the Nokia n8 phone I just bought her 6 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,20,Love the Nokia Lumia 512!
B00COYOAYW,15,21,Nokia nothing realy to say.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,Bought it for my 13 year old she loves it Great buy love it I would recommend  Nokia Lumia 521
B00COYOAYW,15,23,Exceptional Buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,Nokia lumia.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,Battery shortlife.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,battery issue.
B00COYOAYW,16,5,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,6,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,Then it wouldn't charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,8,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,10,Wont hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,Phone keeps shutting off, even after battery is fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,One issue with this phone, is the battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,19,My only issue about the phone is the battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,After 28 days it started to heat at the charging port.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,Can I just get 15 or so batteries and replace them each month so I have a good working phone month after month?
B00COYOAYW,16,22,The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,battery wont charge sometimes so i have to jiggle it until its in the right position.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,2,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,The headphone jack!
B00COYOAYW,17,4,The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,My calls drop and my bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,Web worked well, calls came in clear and I could hear what the other person was saying, it had some okay apps...not really an app person.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,9,Bought a car that has a Windows-based voice rec/Bluetooth interface and ithe phone just drops the connection each time.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,The music sounds great!
B00COYOAYW,17,11,They didn't fix the problem!
B00COYOAYW,17,12,Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality.
B00COYOAYW,17,13,Piece of junk no
B00COYOAYW,17,14,no problems with poor connections or dropped calls after 3-4 weeks.2.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,Speaking of clear, this phone has a clear reception and texting is great.I bought one for my wife about a week after I got mine for a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,I would have to turn the Samsung Bluetooth on and off to get it connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,17,I haven't heard on any bad things with this phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,Listened to a ball game recently with it...set it on the counter and I could hear it clearly from 30 ft.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,problems i seem to have are.1.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Piece of junk.
B00COYOAYW,17,21,headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,My Samsung Galaxy also an annoying problem when trying to connect to my built in Bluetooth speaker system in my car.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,24,But then a couple of weeks ago I started noticing dropped calls and bad call quality; calls would break up or become full of static.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,3,If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,Good phone, better than I've expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,I just wish it had a better camera like the new Nokia phones.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,better than expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,Camera is very bad and has no flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,a different Nokia
B00COYOAYW,18,11,One more thing, even without the flash on the camera, it takes VERY good photos.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,(otherwise better than android/ios).get
B00COYOAYW,18,14,The camera is ok better than any of my other phones.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,I did not expect this from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,Good quality Nokia Lumia.
B00COYOAYW,18,17,better than i expected it to be.
B00COYOAYW,18,18,so far so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,not bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,20,The only problem I'm having is with the camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,21,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,22,Lastly the camera works very well even though the phone does not have flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,23,(n8 has way better camera but that is it)This still has a good camera but no flash but nothing the right lighting wont solve.
B00COYOAYW,18,24,Turning into a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,Comes with SIM card (fyi).
B00COYOAYW,19,3,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,19,8,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,11,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,We just swapped out the SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,16,Buy a sim card from t mobile any3.activate it online not from a phone use your phone lMElNumber,sim card number,activation code4.pick
B00COYOAYW,19,17,So, don't through away the sim that comes with the lumia 521; you might need it if your old phone doesn't have a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,20,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,It even came with micro-SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,It's internal memory is enough for all the apps I use and more.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,20,1,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,20,2,I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,Returned.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,After I received and used it, this item works like a champ.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,Had to return them.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,We returned.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,Got it just in time for Valentines day � it was also brand new in the box
B00COYOAYW,20,13,Arrived on time.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,I returned the phone to Amazon and got a replacement.
B00COYOAYW,20,15,Would've returned it if I still have box it came in.
B00COYOAYW,20,16,I purchased as used item .
B00COYOAYW,20,17,Well just received this phone,I was replacing a huawei?
B00COYOAYW,20,18,Be careful when you purchase this product.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,I am really disappointed with this phone purchase.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,Had no problems getting a refund.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,About ten days later, got a replacement with no back cover!
B00COYOAYW,20,22,Btw one came that would not charge and I returned it no problem to amazon and got a replacement phone even before I had shipped the broken one ...kudos amazon !
B00COYOAYW,20,23,I came a cross this item and bought it as a trial.
B00COYOAYW,20,24,I returned it and got my money back.
B00COYOAYW,21,0,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,dont buy.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,4,They hung up 3 times.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,To start with, I had problems with the phone as it would come-up with T-mobile and then no service.
B00COYOAYW,21,6,One quick call to T-mobile support and I was up and running.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,Also TMobile was if little help.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,10,I got the same problem in the replacement and T-mobile stores could not fix the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,I am still waiting on them to call me back.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,Horrible phone and service.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,T-mobile stores said it is the problem with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,Now I have to buy another phone... Again...
B00COYOAYW,21,17,The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,Now i am having other problems with phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,I called t-mobile to decode it, but they refused to do that.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,Poor product quality and poor customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,I went to T-mobile and they tried 2/3 sim cards, and none of them would solve the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,If the replacement doesn't work, I will then know it is T-Mobile's service and send the phone back for a refund and head back to AT&T.;Update:  04/07/2014.For a short while my phone service with TMobile was good.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,But i was using android before this.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,I think its better, and faster than an android phone, no it is faster.
B00COYOAYW,22,2,the 4g speeds are faster than i expected for such a cheap phone .
B00COYOAYW,22,3,Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G.
B00COYOAYW,22,4,And whatsapp and Viber are too slow.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,This phone is not crappy.The UI was extremely smooth (I almost like it more than the Android / IPhone approach).
B00COYOAYW,22,6,Its slow!
B00COYOAYW,22,7,I though I was upgrading to a better phone, I had a galaxy s android.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,The battery life is better than my old Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,I had purchase others devices and the experiences have been better than this one.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,I mean it compares or is even better to me than the Iphone or Samsung devices.
B00COYOAYW,22,11,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,22,13,There are two things that must be clarified if you just got this phone and you coming from Android or Iphone.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,You will not find an Android phone in this price range that has such a smooth and lag-free experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,15,It doesnt lag at all and what a relief coming from Android;3.
B00COYOAYW,22,16,The device can be used.
B00COYOAYW,22,17,You'll like it if you like WIN 8. it works smoothly and its fast.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,fast, fast – There is no lag on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,First of, this phones dual-core processor and 512mb of RAM wouldn't make it very far in the Android world, but here it's snappy and responsive, no lag experienced and apps run smoothly.
B00COYOAYW,22,20,just like the windows 8 OS, there is VERY limited customization compared to other phone OS's such as Android or Apple.
B00COYOAYW,22,21,4G speed and WiFi calling are topping on the cake.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,First thing you have to do is that you have to avoid comparing this smartphone with higher end devices such as the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Iphone, or other Nokia Lumia devices.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,Processor - (I can't find any lag on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,This phone was impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,Impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,5,but i read reviews before buying it and i did not read any type saying that they had the type of problems I'm having.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,The real thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,its real easy to use
B00COYOAYW,23,9,It works almost fine now I still have a few more things left to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,10,Just have a hard time typing.
B00COYOAYW,23,11,He was disappointed.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,Nokia's are known as global phones, so I figured I'd have no problem using this phone abroad.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,Almost every word I type.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,Although I think it's just that I have to get used to typing on an onscreen keyboard (I am coming from a physical one, though I have used swype on friends' phones).
B00COYOAYW,23,16,This is where things turned sour.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,Our (very cynical) conclusion is Microsoft is doing their Microsoft thing... hoping that their customers will figure out what the problem is.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,Bad Luck????
B00COYOAYW,23,19,then the exact same thing happend.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,Calling someone, real easy.Not a bad deal at all.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,I have severe finger dexterity problems and can use this phone more easily than I could my geezer phone (aka Jitterbug).
B00COYOAYW,23,22,Disappointing and not very user friendly.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,I do need to use a stylus with the onscreen keyboard.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,I like the functionality of putting all the things commonly used on the start screen and a simple slide shows everything available on the device.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,It did come in a timely manner.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,from time to time getting stuck, .Have to turn it off to get it back.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,However, you cannot open 2 apps at the same time, so every time you change to another application you have to start all over.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,7,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,I have had this phone for almost a month now and I really like it; however, sometime it freezes and when you try to click on any of the apps , it does not open which causes me to turn it off and on again so....
B00COYOAYW,24,10,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,The screen just goes black and I have to wait for some time for it to react.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,The first 2 weeks with this phone were fine, however, soon it started turning off by itself (meaning the power button doesn't do anything.)
B00COYOAYW,24,15,The power button does not respond when it freezes.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,17,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,The only bad thing about it is that every time I drop it it turns of immediately.overall
B00COYOAYW,24,19,We have had no problems with it freezing up or having to be reset or anything like that.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,There is not much that would work, tried a soft reset, turning on/off etc it would not work.
B00COYOAYW,24,21,Basically you click and hold back, wait for the opened app screen, selected the app and just press escape(back until closed.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,Even if you lock the screen while on a call it unlocks after a bit and happens all over again.Otherwise, no complaints.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,I can make calls get texts and pictures text.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,You can say "text Joanna", and then dictate your message and send it.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,25,9,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,25,11,But it still has wifi.
B00COYOAYW,25,12,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,25,14,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,15,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,25,17,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,good for calling and texting.
B00COYOAYW,25,19,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,This girl sends something like 5,000 text messages a month.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,If you turn this on, you’ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,The only problem that we have found is that it will not send picture texts (maybe because we are not paying for data, we only use the wifi).
B00COYOAYW,25,24,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B004T36GCU,0,0,The size and the screen is good.
B004T36GCU,0,1,The phone is just great.
B004T36GCU,0,2,The phone is amazing, very fast and have a big screen, i think, for the price, is a nice phone

B004T36GCU,0,4,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,0,5,Great Screen, Fast Processor, Awful Battery.
B004T36GCU,0,6,It has athe perfect size scree for my hands.
B004T36GCU,0,7,The phone works perfectly, with a big screen yet still a reasonable size, it's all it needs to be.
B004T36GCU,0,8,Nice.
B004T36GCU,0,9,THE PHONE IS NICE.
B004T36GCU,0,10,Beautiful screen - 4.3" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2.
B004T36GCU,0,11,The phone feels solid.
B004T36GCU,0,12,I feel cheated and deceived.
B004T36GCU,0,13,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,0,14,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,0,15,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,0,16,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,0,17,Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight.
B004T36GCU,0,18,The display is large yet the phone is small and thin enough to fit into a pocket.
B004T36GCU,0,19,The display is amazing, the touch screen is flawless.
B004T36GCU,0,20,It's fast, has a great display and does everything I need it to.
B004T36GCU,0,21,Small and easy to carry with one hand.
B004T36GCU,0,22,Everything works perfectly and smoothly.
B004T36GCU,0,23,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,0,24,It's pretty fast.
B004T36GCU,1,0,The phone works and I can run apps on it.
B004T36GCU,1,1,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,1,2,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,3,good.
B004T36GCU,1,4,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,1,5,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,6,I even had to look on youtube how to do it cause i was giving up.. anyways its a good phone!
B004T36GCU,1,7,Android app store is superb.
B004T36GCU,1,8,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,9,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,10,The only thing work is the internet as the po ket tablet.
B004T36GCU,1,11,Had android 2.3(gingerbread on it) so thats a big plus.
B004T36GCU,1,12,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,1,13,My first android.
B004T36GCU,1,14,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,15,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,16,I can not download games that i would like to play, such as plants vs zombies 2 and it losses the signal very easy
B004T36GCU,1,17,Wifi and Android performs identically to a Samsung tablet with the same 2.3 operating system.
B004T36GCU,1,18,Easy to use, many features, many pre-down loaded apps, great price, highly suggest.
B004T36GCU,1,19,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,1,20,I have had many phones in the past including iPhones and I know that none are invincible.
B004T36GCU,1,21,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,1,22,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,1,23,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,1,24,Some of the apps are not meant for android 2.3 and if you try to force them on this one, it may end up freezing your phone.Camera is great.
B004T36GCU,2,0,great phone.
B004T36GCU,2,1,Great price.
B004T36GCU,2,2,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,3,Very good phone for the price!
B004T36GCU,2,4,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,2,5,So overall I'd say this is a great product for a great price.
B004T36GCU,2,6,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,7,so far so good.
B004T36GCU,2,8,Good phone at a cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,9,Good phone for cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,10,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,2,11,may be good.
B004T36GCU,2,12,very good smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,13,window was really great.
B004T36GCU,2,14,I think i got it for a good deal.
B004T36GCU,2,15,Great Phone.
B004T36GCU,2,16,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,2,17,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,18,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,2,19,Good product.
B004T36GCU,2,20,The phone is just great.
B004T36GCU,2,21,So far so good.
B004T36GCU,2,22,Everything works great.
B004T36GCU,2,23,It works great!
B004T36GCU,2,24,GREAT DEAL.
B004T36GCU,3,0,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,3,1,Other phones that I have owned, the battery life had lasted me 3 or 4 days.
B004T36GCU,3,2,Poor battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,3,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,3,4,Good! i really like this phone except its batery life.
B004T36GCU,3,5,The battery life is just pathetic.
B004T36GCU,3,6,Glitchy and no battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,7,I have to charge it atleast once a day.
B004T36GCU,3,8,I tried to take the battery out and try again.
B004T36GCU,3,9,it lasts 2-3 days most for me.
B004T36GCU,3,10,Great phone, but no battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,11,The battery life is not as bad as some have made it out to be.
B004T36GCU,3,12,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,3,13,Great Phone but bad battery.
B004T36GCU,3,14,I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,15,Very good smart phone.Everything is good, except that the battery is not strong enough, and could just last for one day long...
B004T36GCU,3,16,The battery is so-so--you have to charge it every night but sometimes the battery will last great all day and then others, it's down to yellow before dinner, and there are no more programs running on it than any other day.
B004T36GCU,3,17,The only bad thing about it is the battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,18,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,3,19,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,3,20,Battery Problems.
B004T36GCU,3,21,I did not rate battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,22,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,3,23,Great Phone but Batt Life sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,24,It is all around a good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,0,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,1,Not good.
B004T36GCU,4,2,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,3,good.
B004T36GCU,4,4,I am sure it was probably a good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,5,good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,6,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,4,7,Really good.
B004T36GCU,4,8,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,9,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,4,10,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,4,11,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,4,12,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,13,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,14,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,15,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,16,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,17,Really Good!
B004T36GCU,4,18,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,4,19,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,4,20,This phone was no good.
B004T36GCU,4,21,when listening to music with headset quality is really good, maybe even better than other phones (using quality headset).
B004T36GCU,4,22,poor quality phone.
B004T36GCU,4,23,Excellent so far.
B004T36GCU,4,24,not good.!!!
B004T36GCU,5,0,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,1,The picture is great and the camera is great.
B004T36GCU,5,2,I would give it five star but no front camera will only get it four.
B004T36GCU,5,3,a great phone so far...
B004T36GCU,5,4,The only thing I am missing is a front camera for video calls.
B004T36GCU,5,5,The 8Mp camera is like cell phone camera, not like any kind of 8Mp camera.
B004T36GCU,5,6,Camera 8MP is good, but some pictures once token can not be stored if you use flash.
B004T36GCU,5,7,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,5,8,It has good picture quality for a phone it is sensitive to movement when taking the pictures.
B004T36GCU,5,9,It's a really great smart phone for a little price!The only thing that needs it's a back camera for video calls!But all the rest it's a great phone I'm very pleased!
B004T36GCU,5,10,This is a great phone, it is fast, the display is awesome, touch is great, camera is great and it has everything you would expect from an advanced first line smart phone.
B004T36GCU,5,11,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,5,12,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,5,13,The camera is also very blurry, unlike the one I had before.
B004T36GCU,5,14,It is a great phone, very functional, easy to handle.Great pictures and videos.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,5,15,OMG THE PICTURE FEATURE ONLY SHOOTS ONE WAY.
B004T36GCU,5,16,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,5,17,The best phone in the world has a great screen and downloads so fast and takes great pictures but battery doesnt last no time and i guess thats the down side to having a great phone theres always going to be cons.
B004T36GCU,5,18,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,5,19,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,5,20,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,5,21,Plus, as it's supposed to be a 4G phone,  there is no front camera.
B004T36GCU,5,22,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,5,23,The pictures are very blury!
B004T36GCU,5,24,It has a dual flash which also works great for the built in flashlight app.
B004T36GCU,6,0,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,6,1,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,6,2,Just insert your sim card n use.
B004T36GCU,6,3,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,4,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,6,5,SD Card issues.
B004T36GCU,6,6,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,6,7,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,6,8,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,6,9,Also the 8G MicroSD card was missing.
B004T36GCU,6,10,No extra battery, MicroSD memory card, or microphone/earphone were received with the shipment.
B004T36GCU,6,11,Also suggest you have a microSD with a lot of memory cause the phone memory is not sufficient.
B004T36GCU,6,12,It is fast and the memory is good.I would buy another one.
B004T36GCU,6,13,However i checked on Gsm areana it says phone came with 8gm memory card i never got one.
B004T36GCU,6,14,The phone comes with an 8gb sd card for storage of photos, games, music, ect.
B004T36GCU,6,15,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,6,16,No matter which one we used, no micro SD card would work on this phone, which is sad because a good majority of the phone's functions need one.
B004T36GCU,6,17,I have T-Mobile and I was really scared that it wouldn't work because this phone got so many bad reviews on how it wouldn't read their sim cards.
B004T36GCU,6,18,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,6,19,Additionally, I only received the phone, battery, and charger, NO MicroSD memory card or microphone/earphone were received with the shipment.
B004T36GCU,6,20,Very good phone for the price!
B004T36GCU,6,21,However I would recommend that you purchase it works well.
B004T36GCU,6,22,I got the 32 gb card and it works just fine.When it came in, the screen protector was a little gross looking but functional.
B004T36GCU,6,23,It also doesn't come with an 8GB microSD even though it says it should in the phone guide.
B004T36GCU,6,24,the order should have sd ram memory with it, but their was no sd memory, I need my 8GB memory please
B004T36GCU,7,0,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,7,1,The Phone I received was not new.
B004T36GCU,7,2,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,3,Not working chargerhead.
B004T36GCU,7,4,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,7,5,Also all I received is the phone and charger, so this phone looks like it was re-packaged.Apart from that the phone works and seems in good condition but definately not new.
B004T36GCU,7,6,The phone works great and is more than I expected.
B004T36GCU,7,7,never got this order.
B004T36GCU,7,8,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,9,other than that my phone works perfectly.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,7,11,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,7,12,VERY GOOD CONDITIONS.
B004T36GCU,7,13,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,7,14,The phone works and I can run apps on it.
B004T36GCU,7,15,i received item and the battery was not working i sent an email to the buyer, he right away sent me another one, even though its not working properly but i think its good for the price
B004T36GCU,7,16,great phone.
B004T36GCU,7,17,So overall I'd say this is a great product for a great price.
B004T36GCU,7,18,I ordered this phone because I already had one before and loved it.
B004T36GCU,7,19,Nice.
B004T36GCU,7,20,LOVED THIS PHONE.
B004T36GCU,7,21,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,7,22,Works well.
B004T36GCU,7,23,Other wise it works great!
B004T36GCU,7,24,It Works very well.
B004T36GCU,8,0,wasnt working.
B004T36GCU,8,1,not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,8,2,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,8,3,Unlocked phone.
B004T36GCU,8,4,Not unlocked, is a hoax.
B004T36GCU,8,5,this cell its not unlock.
B004T36GCU,8,6,and services.
B004T36GCU,8,7,Service at Home.
B004T36GCU,8,8,It says that the phone is T-Mobile unlocked but it NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,8,9,THIS IS NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,8,10,I wouldn't recommened this phone to any one unless u have an at@t service.
B004T36GCU,8,11,but it is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,8,12,ITS NOT UNLOCKED!!!
B004T36GCU,8,13,NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,8,14,this phone, although apparently unlocked did not work for me.
B004T36GCU,8,15,Phone is ok but it was a AT&T; phone.
B004T36GCU,8,16,The phone didn't work at all.
B004T36GCU,8,17,Phone didn't work.
B004T36GCU,8,18,Phone works great but came locked.
B004T36GCU,8,19,came locked but works great.
B004T36GCU,8,20,When I do have a signal the phone works great.
B004T36GCU,8,21,Neither ATT nor another one:((( what should i do?????
B004T36GCU,8,22,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,8,23,It doesn't comes unlocked.
B004T36GCU,8,24,The phone is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,9,0,Great Phone.
B004T36GCU,9,1,I love HTC. this phone was so good.
B004T36GCU,9,2,Not the best.
B004T36GCU,9,3,It was great while it lasted, but maybe it's just HTC.
B004T36GCU,9,4,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,9,5,I love this phone, is the best phone i ever had, only the android os version is old, need an actualization
B004T36GCU,9,6,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,9,7,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,9,8,Fast shipped with everything.
B004T36GCU,9,9,Not upgrade-able to latest Android versions.
B004T36GCU,9,10,Shipped very fast!
B004T36GCU,9,11,first off i must say the htc inspire 4g is an awesome phone .
B004T36GCU,9,12,Best phone ever - or not!
B004T36GCU,9,13,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,9,14,I was an ATT customer when I bought this phone and the 4g was really fast, faster than my ATT DSL.
B004T36GCU,9,15,Ovserbation on the use of a HTC A9192 Inspire 4G unlocked Phone.
B004T36GCU,9,16,The storage is less than 2 GB.
B004T36GCU,9,17,I had never had HTC mobile, It works very well, no black out, battery ok, great sound, good processing speed.
B004T36GCU,9,18,Love the the phone, my only issue is, i am still trying to download the BB app, other than that the phone is great!
B004T36GCU,9,19,I have had it for a little over a week now and I am still being impressed by its features.Update:
B004T36GCU,9,20,This is a great phone, it is fast, the display is awesome, touch is great, camera is great and it has everything you would expect from an advanced first line smart phone.
B004T36GCU,9,21,It Works very well.
B004T36GCU,9,22,Good phone, pay attention that "4G" doesn't means that support 4G or LTE network, good size and the quality of an HTC product
B004T36GCU,9,23,I have had several phones, but this one needs some improvements.
B004T36GCU,9,24,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,10,0,Love it.
B004T36GCU,10,1,I did love it so much.
B004T36GCU,10,2,Love it.
B004T36GCU,10,3,LOVED THIS PHONE.
B004T36GCU,10,4,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,5,I love it.
B004T36GCU,10,6,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,7,Love...at first.
B004T36GCU,10,8,I love to have that phone.
B004T36GCU,10,9,I love this phone, everything about it is awesome.
B004T36GCU,10,10,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,10,11,My kids love it for the easy to manouvre
B004T36GCU,10,12,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,10,13,in love.
B004T36GCU,10,14,However I love my phone.
B004T36GCU,10,15,haven't figured how to work it yet.
B004T36GCU,10,16,It is easy to operate.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,17,My husband has this same phone and it works great.
B004T36GCU,10,18,I do love this phone, but having issues.
B004T36GCU,10,19,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,10,20,Although, I haven't found a way to update the software but its nice i love it.
B004T36GCU,10,21,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,22,nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,23,Easy to use, looks nice, no issues.
B004T36GCU,10,24,All other features work well and the phone has a nice layout.
B004T36GCU,11,0,fits my need very well, but i have to say, the volume button on the left actually doesn't work very well.
B004T36GCU,11,1,A good phone with low ringing tone.
B004T36GCU,11,2,Other than that is pretty good phone.
B004T36GCU,11,3,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,11,4,i gotta push it so HARD to turn the volume down, it's the only flaw.
B004T36GCU,11,5,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,11,6,This phone was  locked and was not new and did not have a manual.
B004T36GCU,11,7,when I would lay it down it would turn off and the volume button was broke off... but other than that phone looked new
B004T36GCU,11,8,It will continue to do this until the user powers the screen on and off.
B004T36GCU,11,9,I like that it is easy and very friendly to users like me who are not so much into technology.
B004T36GCU,11,10,worked great but kept shutting off and volume button was broke.
B004T36GCU,11,11,and kindda annoying me.
B004T36GCU,11,12,I did find that my first all was a bit low, no matter how much volume I added, but my 2nd call made up for that.
B004T36GCU,11,13,I wish i could give it a 5 star but the speaker phone function is not ok, when i select speaker mode the other person can not read me.
B004T36GCU,11,14,It's pretty user friendly and simple to learn, well I am kinda tech-savvy so that could explain my getting along with the phone so well.
B004T36GCU,11,15,When comparing the two phones side by side, I noticed that one of the phones has a void sticker over one screw underneath the side cover.
B004T36GCU,11,16,The top mounted power on/off button requires a large amount of force to push it in to get the phone to see the button press.There was a 12 volt car charger adapter in the box, which was not ever included in a new shrink-wrapped box.
B004T36GCU,11,17,I had a friend with the same phone.
B004T36GCU,11,18,Did not know this until I got to Mexico to give to my friend and new bride for wedding presents.
B004T36GCU,11,19,Please click on the Customer Uploaded photos to view my pictures.The first seller I will review is iCellPhones.
B004T36GCU,11,20,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,11,21,I uploaded my own customer photos to go along with this review.
B004T36GCU,11,22,Basically no matter how many bars show on the phone I get no calls, no texts, I can make no calls and no texts.And I've taken pretty good care of my phone.
B004T36GCU,11,23,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,11,24,The Volume button don't work, I have audio problem.
B004T36GCU,12,0,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,1,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,2,Don't waste your money on it.
B004T36GCU,12,3,wast of money.
B004T36GCU,12,4,Wasn't worth my money.
B004T36GCU,12,5,I'll not recommend this phone to anyone, so don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,12,6,Don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,12,7,I got this for $99, it was worth the money.
B004T36GCU,12,8,Great value for money.
B004T36GCU,12,9,Nice phone, but internet would never work.
B004T36GCU,12,10,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,12,11,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,12,12,I emailed them again and I returned the the phone for my money.
B004T36GCU,12,13,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,12,14,dont buy this phone u will be wasting ur money had mine litteraly a month and it already stopped working
B004T36GCU,12,15,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,12,16,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B004T36GCU,12,17,Worth $30 not $130.
B004T36GCU,12,18,Don't buy it worked nice for about a week but now it's really slow and doesn't well.
B004T36GCU,12,19,nice cellphone but.
B004T36GCU,12,20,apart from that it is really worth that money.
B004T36GCU,12,21,I wouldnt buy it again.
B004T36GCU,12,22,The only way to get the phone on the internet is with wifi.
B004T36GCU,12,23,Do not waste your hard earned money on this HTC.
B004T36GCU,12,24,The GPS does not work at all.
B004T36GCU,13,0,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,13,1,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,2,However, there are many cases, where this does not work.
B004T36GCU,13,3,Oh and one more thing, after a while if you are clumsy like me, the touch screen doesn't respond very well to large fingers, I have small fine fingers and I can use it with no problem.
B004T36GCU,13,4,Disappointed big time
B004T36GCU,13,5,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,6,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,13,7,In some cases, the phone will start up once you remove the battery and put it back in.
B004T36GCU,13,8,Beautiful screen - 4.3" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2.
B004T36GCU,13,9,This was not a big deal and after I put my protective case on, I can't even see them...  not that they were that bad to begin with.
B004T36GCU,13,10,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,13,11,Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight.
B004T36GCU,13,12,This could cause it to get scratched easily, but with a case on the problem is easily solved.Overview: So really, the only con is battery life.
B004T36GCU,13,13,It did not work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,14,Two phones has scratches, and sometimes turn off.plus is quite slow during use.
B004T36GCU,13,15,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,16,The durability of this phone is like no other.
B004T36GCU,13,17,A little glitchy, but so durable.
B004T36GCU,13,18,Inherent screen freeze with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,19,i switched back to my cracked screen phone!
B004T36GCU,13,20,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,13,21,It does random restarts and the touch screen does its own thing sometimes, but to be the durability outweighs the annoying little negatives.
B004T36GCU,13,22,The phone works perfectly, with a big screen yet still a reasonable size, it's all it needs to be.
B004T36GCU,13,23,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,24,I cannot customize or organize my home screen.
B004T36GCU,14,0,Don't get if you need to download apps.
B004T36GCU,14,1,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,14,2,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,14,3,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,4,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,5,Android app store is superb.
B004T36GCU,14,6,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,14,7,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,14,8,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,9,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,10,It updates to Android 2.3, may eventually update to 4.0, unknown so farCons:1.
B004T36GCU,14,11,This is why you can not buy anything on line but apps.
B004T36GCU,14,12,I bought this phone new, and to date although the os has updated, whenever Itry to update it I  cannot.
B004T36GCU,14,13,second the phone can not handle more then 1 or 2 apps installed from the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,14,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,14,15,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,16,My first android.
B004T36GCU,14,17,Also, after that reset, I never was able to load Google Play again, leaving me with the old android market app.
B004T36GCU,14,18,I got this to use the square credit card reader but it requires an app to be downloaded from the google store.
B004T36GCU,14,19,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,14,20,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,21,I will post an update when I have had time to play around with it.
B004T36GCU,14,22,I believe that Amazon should provide me a 32gb microSD card for the phone as a courtesy to the missing item.There is no information regarding updates to the operating system being used so I am not sure we will be able to update to the latest Android operating system.
B004T36GCU,14,23,Then I stopped all the apps and services and put in flight mode.After that  it was alive for 3 hours only.
B004T36GCU,14,24,ANDROID UPGRADES MAKING ME CRAZY!
B004T36GCU,15,0,I bought this phone about a year ago.
B004T36GCU,15,1,I like it but it'll only last two years...
B004T36GCU,15,2,I would not recommend anyone to buy this
B004T36GCU,15,3,Dropped it once 3 months ago and nothing was wrong.When buying your phone think about how it'll work out 6 months from now before you get into a 2 year contract you can't get out of.
B004T36GCU,15,4,Please no one should purchase this device.
B004T36GCU,15,5,DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,15,6,It's been over a month since I bought them so I can't return them.
B004T36GCU,15,7,this month i am due for an upgrade and its been the worst 2 years having this phone bye bye htc not going to be buying another
B004T36GCU,15,8,I bought this mobile on January, 2013.
B004T36GCU,15,9,Then I upgraded to this phone and few months later nothing.
B004T36GCU,15,10,Bad Purchase.
B004T36GCU,15,11,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,12,I would NOT recommend buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,13,However I would recommend that you purchase it works well.
B004T36GCU,15,14,Great price.
B004T36GCU,15,15,purchase.
B004T36GCU,15,16,Bought for only 2 months and now the phone can't power-on.
B004T36GCU,15,17,I will recommend it.!
B004T36GCU,15,18,I know most people replace a phone every couple of years, but I was hoping for another year of use.
B004T36GCU,15,19,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,15,20,I bought this phone from amazon to replace my wife's broken phone  she had from T-mobile.
B004T36GCU,15,21,it broke down after eight months.
B004T36GCU,15,22,It says that the phone is T-Mobile unlocked but it NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,15,23,But exactly two years after purchasing, it just died.
B004T36GCU,15,24,I purchased this phone through Amazon and it is definitely not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,16,0,Missing Battery.
B004T36GCU,16,1,Got to go back to Mexico with new battery next week.
B004T36GCU,16,2,Battery issue.
B004T36GCU,16,3,The phone didn't even charge.
B004T36GCU,16,4,Battery issues.
B004T36GCU,16,5,it won't charge anymore unless i put something between the battery and battery door to make the battery go all the way in and seat better.
B004T36GCU,16,6,This was all within the first day
B004T36GCU,16,7,it didn't work.
B004T36GCU,16,8,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,9,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,16,10,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,16,11,I can't even see if my phone works.....
B004T36GCU,16,12,Battery wasn't working.
B004T36GCU,16,13,Phone does not hold charge.
B004T36GCU,16,14,The battery started heating up after only 2 weeks of use.
B004T36GCU,16,15,BATTERY ISSUES.
B004T36GCU,16,16,stop working proberly after a month.
B004T36GCU,16,17,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,16,18,FULLY CHARGED BATTERY DOES NOT LAST UP TO 24H RS, EXCEPT IF YOU DO NOT USE THE PHONE AT ALL.2.
B004T36GCU,16,19,Poor battery life.
B004T36GCU,16,20,Am having battery problem. the battery does not last not even 3 hours straight i have to be keep charging the phone
B004T36GCU,16,21,Wouldn't hold a charge.
B004T36GCU,16,22,the battery is dead in 2 hours.
B004T36GCU,16,23,Would not turn back on when i got home from work, letting it charge.
B004T36GCU,16,24,At first, the battery takes a long time to charge and last for only few hours and now the phone is dead.
B004T36GCU,17,0,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,17,1,phone stopped working deffective phone.
B004T36GCU,17,2,it would disconnect calls while in a call.
B004T36GCU,17,3,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,17,4,problem on phone.
B004T36GCU,17,5,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,6,but it just does not work.what
B004T36GCU,17,7,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,17,8,The Volume button don't work, I have audio problem.
B004T36GCU,17,9,I've tried many ways to fix it, from restart it, to call somebody and unplug headphone while talking and put it on speaker (which fixed the problem at first but that trick doesn't work now), I even tried to do factory reset way but none of these tricks work.
B004T36GCU,17,10,It has a fm radio tuner built in but it uses the ear buds as a antenna so you can't listen to the radio with bluetooth headphones.
B004T36GCU,17,11,Now my mobile's speaker is not working.
B004T36GCU,17,12,It's reception is poor and drops calls constantly.
B004T36GCU,17,13,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,17,14,I can't play any music or videos unless I plug in my headphone.
B004T36GCU,17,15,Non-working earpiece speaker.
B004T36GCU,17,16,While in speaker, people complain of it being too noisy.
B004T36GCU,17,17,I however have some issues.The maximum ring volume is not loud.
B004T36GCU,17,18,I can listen to Pandora or FM radio while doing other things.
B004T36GCU,17,19,I wish I had listen to the bad reviews before I bought it.
B004T36GCU,17,20,Even with the volume at max it is difficult to hear the person on the other line.
B004T36GCU,17,21,Ringer wasn't very loud I sent the phone back my husband is hard of hearing and he couldn't hardly hear it
B004T36GCU,17,22,terrible phone.
B004T36GCU,17,23,A nice looking piece of junk.
B004T36GCU,17,24,piece of junk i have to say.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Not bad.
B004T36GCU,18,1,Everything but the camera.
B004T36GCU,18,2,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,18,3,My expectation about the phone was bad.
B004T36GCU,18,4,Better than I had expected.
B004T36GCU,18,5,Not a good choice.
B004T36GCU,18,6,There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time.
B004T36GCU,18,7,The camera, yes 8 MP.
B004T36GCU,18,8,very bad quality the battery is sucks.
B004T36GCU,18,9,not a bad phone.expect
B004T36GCU,18,10,poor quality phone.
B004T36GCU,18,11,Lacks of a front camera and rear camera below average.
B004T36GCU,18,12,This phone is borderline functional for even the basic features.
B004T36GCU,18,13,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,18,14,it didnot meet my  expectations.
B004T36GCU,18,15,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,18,16,bad phone.
B004T36GCU,18,17,too bad.
B004T36GCU,18,18,It has the worst camera I have seen on any phone.
B004T36GCU,18,19,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,18,20,Other than that is pretty good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,21,This phone is not bad for the price, though it does not meet my expectations but generally it is manageable.
B004T36GCU,18,22,This is a pretty decent phone for a back up.
B004T36GCU,18,23,how i expected, the phone was like new, very good conditions, the only bad  thing is battery do not longs all the day,but all the another things works great, i recommend it
B004T36GCU,18,24,It has a nice camera, but don't use the video feature too long because it sucks the battery like there's not tomorrow.Don't waste your money on this pretty phone.
B004T36GCU,19,0,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,19,1,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,19,2,Not working.
B004T36GCU,19,3,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,4,When the phone card was placed in it, it just would not work.
B004T36GCU,19,5,The phone didnt came with Memory Card.
B004T36GCU,19,6,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,19,7,Put the At&t; SIM card in and was on my way!
B004T36GCU,19,8,Once I put in the old sim card the phone seems to be fine.
B004T36GCU,19,9,It hardly works.
B004T36GCU,19,10,This says it is an unlocked phone...yet it did not work for our t-mobile SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,11,not working, would not recognize the att sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,12,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,19,13,This device didn't work at all couldn't read any of the SIM cards.
B004T36GCU,19,14,Just insert your sim card n use.
B004T36GCU,19,15,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,19,16,Missing MicroSD card.
B004T36GCU,19,17,Everything works just fine for my tmobile sim i already have.
B004T36GCU,19,18,It tells me that their is no sim in the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,19,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,19,20,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,19,21,Works well.
B004T36GCU,19,22,This phone labeled as ATT and unlocked phone, but we took it to the att to have the sim card installed,  after serveral places, the, phone never recognized the sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,23,given all the fingerprints e tc this phone was not n.ew. the phone could not read my sim card and could n ot read my SD card T Mobile
B004T36GCU,19,24,No Micro SD CardM.
B004T36GCU,20,0,I want to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,1,Will be returning it.

B004T36GCU,20,11,I do not know whether it had to do with just that one phone - may be defective but I had to return it to the seller.
B004T36GCU,20,12,Just received it and already having problem.
B004T36GCU,20,13,I purchased 2 of these from Amazon as a reseller.
B004T36GCU,20,14,I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from Amazon.
B004T36GCU,20,15,The company has approved the return, but I am liable for return postage as well.
B004T36GCU,20,16,I bought the phone and by the time i was out of the states it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,20,17,I must do to return the  damage phone?
B004T36GCU,20,18,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,19,This is why I usually only buy items where the seller is Amazon.
B004T36GCU,20,20,I found out later that the seller was willing to exchange it, but by then I had returned it.
B004T36GCU,20,21,i had this phone for 3 days before i returned it.
B004T36GCU,20,22,Had to replace it.
B004T36GCU,20,23,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.

B004T36GCU,21,18,I will never buy an HTC product again.
B004T36GCU,21,19,Many of the reviews have similar complaints - the phone was defective, never worked, terrible customer service.
B004T36GCU,21,20,I have no service in most areas.
B004T36GCU,21,21,I live in Colombia, so HTC Service is unavailable because it is an exclusive AT&T; product.
B004T36GCU,21,22,They are now sending me a fourth one...i wish i had never had this phone ever....the phone is great...when it actually works...I also know that this phone was recalled from walmart because i work with the cell phones there

B004T36GCU,23,0,Excelente equipo y fácil de utilizar el unico punto negativo es que la bateria no dura mucho y el telefono es un poco pesado
B004T36GCU,23,1,Yo realicé esta queja al recibir el producto, peero lo hice por un canal equivocado,
B004T36GCU,23,2,Mi queja es la siguiente, llegó la caja conteniendo el celular solicitado con dos cuestiones, primero faltaba la memory card que se especifica en el contenido de la caja y segundo es evidente que en la malla que cubre lo que seria el auriular, que es la vista del equipo, está como torcida, eso debe ser defecto de fabrica.
B004T36GCU,23,3,i am disappointed.
B004T36GCU,23,4,They couldn't figure out what the problem was either.
B004T36GCU,23,5,Bad phone!
B004T36GCU,23,6,Very disappointing.
B004T36GCU,23,7,This phone was listed as NEW but it was obvious that it was a refubished phone.
B004T36GCU,23,8,what a disappointment.
B004T36GCU,23,9,i hated this product.
B004T36GCU,23,10,Disappointed.
B004T36GCU,23,11,typed unlocked but i found at&t; word typed on the phone back ,absolutely i am not sure that it will work in egypt.and
B004T36GCU,23,12,muy bueno.
B004T36GCU,23,13,I was completely unsatisfied with this product.
B004T36GCU,23,14,Only thing missing would have been instructions for set up.
B004T36GCU,23,15,then the phone wouldnt let me text certain users on my contact list.
B004T36GCU,23,16,Very disappointed.
B004T36GCU,23,17,worst company ever.
B004T36GCU,23,18,but after start using it, I got very disappointed.
B004T36GCU,23,19,Bad experience for me.
B004T36GCU,23,20,I was extremely disappointed with this product.
B004T36GCU,23,21,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,23,22,The phone works good, but that was a complete dissapointment.
B004T36GCU,23,23,I was very excited when I got this device, but after start using it, I got very disappointed.
B004T36GCU,23,24,This phone was listed as NEW but it was obvious that it was a refubished phone.
B004T36GCU,24,0,button is not working.
B004T36GCU,24,1,The phone locks up all of the time.
B004T36GCU,24,2,when I would lay it down it would turn off and the volume button was broke off... but other than that phone looked new
B004T36GCU,24,3,Granted, I have not tried anything drastic to reboot the phone, but thusfar, the power button is not restarting the phone.
B004T36GCU,24,4,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,24,5,It kept freezing at least 3 to 4 times a day.
B004T36GCU,24,6,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,24,7,My complaints are that at times it shuts down without any cause and I couldn't get it to turn back on.
B004T36GCU,24,8,worked great but kept shutting off and volume button was broke.
B004T36GCU,24,9,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,24,10,the phone is unlocked, the button on the side is not working, the screen is blocked by personal password and i got the battery after aweek of waiting.
B004T36GCU,24,11,i had the phone for almost 3 mths it stopped working last week, kept resetting saying abnormal reset.
B004T36GCU,24,12,The phone freezes and resets its self.
B004T36GCU,24,13,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,24,14,I mean freezing as in the thing gets stuck trying to complete a task, and I can't even shut it down with the power button.
B004T36GCU,24,15,Phone constantly reboot or power off.
B004T36GCU,24,16,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,24,17,When I turned it on first it came on then in a few minutes a red signal came on after that I couldn't get it off the power button did not respond.
B004T36GCU,24,18,just kept shutting off.
B004T36GCU,24,19,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,24,20,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,24,21,It hardly works.
B004T36GCU,24,22,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,24,23,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,24,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,25,0,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,1,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,2,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,3,After charging, I was able to make call and send & receive messages but could not get on the network for internet services.
B004T36GCU,25,4,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,5,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,25,6,This phone is set up to be used in Canada.
B004T36GCU,25,7,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,8,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,9,Had to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,10,Sending it back is a problem as the mail here is very hard to get to in the first place and now I still do not have a phone to use to call someone to come and pick it up.
B004T36GCU,25,11,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,12,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,13,You can use it to call and tx msg.
B004T36GCU,25,14,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,25,15,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,25,16,The only problem is my phones 3g wont work so I always have to look for open wi-fi.
B004T36GCU,25,17,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,25,18,phone would not send picture msg, had to call my provider to get a code to do so again.
B004T36GCU,25,19,I wound up using a SIP provider with free incoming calls, routed missed calls to Google Voice, which then rang the SIP client on my phone.
B004T36GCU,25,20,Also, it is an unlocked phone so I was told that my picture messages will never be able to send and I will not be able to download incoming multimedia messages.
B004T36GCU,25,21,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,25,22,I had photos and videos of someone else on the phone when I received it.
B004T36GCU,25,23,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,25,24,They are now sending me a fourth one...i wish i had never had this phone ever....the phone is great...when it actually works...I also know that this phone was recalled from walmart because i work with the cell phones there
B008HTJLF6,0,0,If you have little hands it might be a little too big.
B008HTJLF6,0,1,I love it's many features but mostly the screen size and quality is fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,0,2,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,0,3,GREAT PHONE!
B008HTJLF6,0,4,Some say it feels cheap, but I don't get that at all.
B008HTJLF6,0,5,The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.
B008HTJLF6,0,6,Love my phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,7,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,0,8,Personally, I feel that the size of the phone and the slim feel are great attributes but others may find it a tad too large for their hands.
B008HTJLF6,0,9,I went with the GS3, b/c I liked the bigger screen.
B008HTJLF6,0,10,A solid phone that is quick and responsive.
B008HTJLF6,0,11,Surprisingly even with the larger screen this isn't a heavy phone and feels quite comfortable in my shirt pocket.The screen is bright and clear.
B008HTJLF6,0,12,Too Thin and too big...
B008HTJLF6,0,13,Hands down.
B008HTJLF6,0,14,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,0,15,Let me first tell you what is good :- Very fast processor- Display is amazing quality, but not very bright.
B008HTJLF6,0,16,Otherwise, the phone is shiny, pretty & has a beautiful screen.
B008HTJLF6,0,17,It's easy to read even in bright sunlight.Voice quality is great.
B008HTJLF6,0,18,This is hands down the fastest, smoothest phone I've seen.
B008HTJLF6,0,19,It's quick, responsive and the graphics are great.
B008HTJLF6,0,20,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,21,I love the dark blue color and the curved glass of the screen feels great in the hand.
B008HTJLF6,0,22,It's a lot lighter than the iPhone and the screen is fantastic!
B008HTJLF6,0,23,She easily slips into my pocket, even with a back case on.FOUR: Surprisingly good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,0,24,Watching videos on the GS3 is a treat.All is, however, not perfect with the GSIII's screen.
B008HTJLF6,1,0,I like the android system and haven't used an iphone to compare it to.
B008HTJLF6,1,1,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,1,2,Much better and faster than an Iphone!! I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO APPLE!! THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD.
B008HTJLF6,1,3,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,1,4,It is way much more better than iPhone4S.
B008HTJLF6,1,5,Don't get me wrong i'm an android lover and really support all the great opportunities with android phones but compared to the newest Iphone 5 this phone does lack a little.
B008HTJLF6,1,6,Also, although the market is catching up, there are still some apps available on the apple market that are not available on the Google play store.
B008HTJLF6,1,7,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,1,8,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,1,9,This is my first Samsung phone and my first Android phone.
B008HTJLF6,1,10,VERY GOOD HARDWARE--NO DATA SYNC.
B008HTJLF6,1,11,It has one- one!- good feature that's making my N7 jealous.
B008HTJLF6,1,12,I would recommend this phone to any android lover or someone in search of a smartphone cheaper than an IPhone 5. Its great for apps and everyday use and is very sturdy compared to many iPhones i have seen.
B008HTJLF6,1,13,If the iPhone was Android, I love that size.2.
B008HTJLF6,1,14,Toggling GPS on and off does not work.
B008HTJLF6,1,15,Love it more than my old iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,1,16,The software on the phone is great.
B008HTJLF6,1,17,Tap into the Google Play store to load your favorite apps, and the SIII feels and functions as good as or better than any desktop or laptop I have ever had.
B008HTJLF6,1,18,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,19,This is his first smartphone and he has not stopped watching videos or loading music.
B008HTJLF6,1,20,I have very mixed feelings about the galaxy sIII but have found that most of the time this phone works great for me.
B008HTJLF6,1,21,I do like social networking and social apps  Samsung's screen is amazing and really does make the apps 'pop'.
B008HTJLF6,1,22,I feel that on jellybean, the next android operating system, this phone would work much smoother and have less of a lethargic feel to it when scrolling through and general everyday use would be easier.
B008HTJLF6,1,23,Excellent device.
B008HTJLF6,1,24,This was a steal.Cons - can be a little glitchy at times, apps stopping, having to reformat my sd card, etc.
B008HTJLF6,2,0,Great phone at a great price.

B008HTJLF6,2,23,If you do not have to have the latest and greatest smartphone, this phone will work well for you.
B008HTJLF6,2,24,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,3,0,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,3,1,Respectable battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,2,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,3,3,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,4,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,3,5,It usually takes all day for my battery to go down.
B008HTJLF6,3,6,Battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,3,7,When I don't use it that much, the battery will last about a day and a half.
B008HTJLF6,3,8,First off the phone has ultra poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,9,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,3,10,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,3,11,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,3,12,Understand the Battery Life isn't great, but neither is my present cell phone life great.
B008HTJLF6,3,13,Good phone.
B008HTJLF6,3,14,Battery life is just so so, to me it's over hyped, although i'm on it alot, probally 3.5-4.5 hours of On Screen time a day.
B008HTJLF6,3,15,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,3,16,Wondering about the Extended Battery life when in use and when not in use, like how long does it "stay" charged before used, as well as how long is it's life.
B008HTJLF6,3,17,I need a good battery life (and a replaceable battery)  The battery life (even with Samsung 'profiles' turned on to help control battery life) did not get me through an entire day.
B008HTJLF6,3,18,I couldn't make it more than 8 hours without charging it.
B008HTJLF6,3,19,It was GREAT... for three days.
B008HTJLF6,3,20,But one day my screen turned off and it never came back.
B008HTJLF6,3,21,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,3,22,BATTERY.
B008HTJLF6,3,23,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,3,24,The biggest issue is the very poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,4,0,Poor call quality!
B008HTJLF6,4,1,Great music and sound quality.8.
B008HTJLF6,4,2,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,4,3,People say my voice has a mechanical muffled quality, and their voices to me have a fuzzy, rasping quality.
B008HTJLF6,4,4,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,5,The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.
B008HTJLF6,4,6,Yet, I was getting very decent quality calls (clear, but a bit tinny sounding).
B008HTJLF6,4,7,Poor Call Quality of Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,4,8,Call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,9,Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.
B008HTJLF6,4,10,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,4,11,I'm really surprised as to how good they are.
B008HTJLF6,4,12,It has been excellent for me.Overall, this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,4,13,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,4,14,The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,15,If games are your objective, it's great.
B008HTJLF6,4,16,In many areas where my previous phone had a good signal, this phone had none.
B008HTJLF6,4,17,Voice Calls Inferior - Beautiful Display at Price of Battery Life.
B008HTJLF6,4,18,Very Poor Reception.
B008HTJLF6,4,19,Poor battery life, wifi & call reception; too big for 1-hand ops.
B008HTJLF6,4,20,Call reception and quality were not equal to the Iphone 5 or the RAZR M from the same locations.
B008HTJLF6,4,21,I'm not needing this for gaming.But the phone's upsides intrigued me as well as a great price through Staples of $99.
B008HTJLF6,4,22,What most customer reviews fail to mention is the quality of the voice calls.
B008HTJLF6,4,23,If you want a phone for wifi connection and making calls, get something else.
B008HTJLF6,4,24,Great phone at a great price.
B008HTJLF6,5,0,Great phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,1,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,5,2,GREAT PHONE!
B008HTJLF6,5,3,The pictures look great.
B008HTJLF6,5,4,Other than that this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,5,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,6,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,5,7,Great phone, terrible camera.
B008HTJLF6,5,8,The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen.
B008HTJLF6,5,9,The camera works well.
B008HTJLF6,5,10,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,11,It has a great camera front and rear and great sound ,this phone is on the front line of technology!
B008HTJLF6,5,12,Great phone for everything!
B008HTJLF6,5,13,The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.
B008HTJLF6,5,14,Good phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,15,The camera is really nice!
B008HTJLF6,5,16,The screen is AMAZING.
B008HTJLF6,5,17,Light weight- Great screen- Nice large bright display- Good camera for stills- Great camera for video- Bright LED flash for the camera and flashlight use- Good speaker sound and volume- No lack of features including NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi 2.4 and 5GHZ, GPS, and more.-
B008HTJLF6,5,18,But besides that tweak, the hardware is solid and the camera is great.
B008HTJLF6,5,19,The camera quality is excellent and takes pictures much faster than previous phones I've owned.
B008HTJLF6,5,20,However, its camera ability is great and there's no better display out there.
B008HTJLF6,5,21,Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.
B008HTJLF6,5,22,the features are awesome and the size of the screen is perfect all in all its a great phone and if i had to do it over i would still make the same choice.
B008HTJLF6,5,23,Battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,5,24,Easy to use.Downside is the camera, it takes terrible quality, out of focus pictures.
B008HTJLF6,6,0,This was a steal.Cons - can be a little glitchy at times, apps stopping, having to reformat my sd card, etc.
B008HTJLF6,6,1,Had battery checked & sim card.
B008HTJLF6,6,2,internal storage of the RAZR M might be a problem...especially since, as with the Sammy, you can't offload apps to the microSD card.
B008HTJLF6,6,3,microSD card slot + 16GB of internal storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,4,SD Card expandable.
B008HTJLF6,6,5,I have 80GB of memory.
B008HTJLF6,6,6,I got it so that I could use the credit card app and it works great.
B008HTJLF6,6,7,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,8,It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.
B008HTJLF6,6,9,I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3.
B008HTJLF6,6,10,Android allows must apps to be saved and launched from the micro SD cards.
B008HTJLF6,6,11,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,6,12,v4.1)Memory card issues - I purchased a few 3rd party memory card chips ranging in size from 16GB to 32GB while I had this phone, and had data corruption issues with each of them (3 in all).
B008HTJLF6,6,13,To force us to buy the step up model, Samsung disable the ability to move apps from internal storage to the micro SD card.
B008HTJLF6,6,14,This feature allows low and mid-range phones to be made with limited internal storage because users can add their own cards.Sammy, however, wants power users to buy the bigger capacity 32gig phones for an extra $50.
B008HTJLF6,6,15,Great design and portability, high price, occasional memory card issues.
B008HTJLF6,6,16,These have the Sammy's big screen, but with the rest of the features of the RAZR and RAZR M, including the outstanding battery life.For you world travelers, the new RAZRs are global-ready, like the Iphone5...buy a SIM card when you get to the new country and replace the Verizon one.
B008HTJLF6,6,17,I loaded them all and they only took less than 1GB of internal storage, so it wasn't really a limitation after all.
B008HTJLF6,6,18,In addition, you can still put all your photos, videos, etc. on the SD card on the RAZRs.Best of all the RAZR M is $150 cheaper than the Galaxy S3 or the Iphone 5.
B008HTJLF6,6,19,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone when it is working properly.
B008HTJLF6,6,20,I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar.
B008HTJLF6,6,21,I wish it worked!
B008HTJLF6,6,22,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,6,23,The cable to charge it is a standard micro USB cable and if you want to access music, pictures or videos, you can do so by connecting it to ANY computer you want, no need to "pair it/sync it" with your iTunes account.The camera is great for both video as well as regular photographs.After one year of use, it is still very fast.I strongly recommend this phone.
B008HTJLF6,6,24,But not enough to bug me.I'm just happy to be able to expand my memory for way less cost than buying a hard to find big iphone.
B008HTJLF6,7,0,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,7,1,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,2,Love my Samsung Galaxy SIII.
B008HTJLF6,7,3,Samsung Galaxy S III paring with Nissan Altima 2007 & 2008 will not happen if the phone is a Ver.
B008HTJLF6,7,4,I was able to get the Galaxy S3 for $29.99.
B008HTJLF6,7,5,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,6,love my s3!!! i ordered the samsung galaxy s 3 and i love it, it far exceeded my expectations.
B008HTJLF6,7,7,Really like this phone.Samsung made a really good job by making this phone!
B008HTJLF6,7,8,Samsung III is great.
B008HTJLF6,7,9,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,10,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,7,11,Love the Verizon Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,12,Upgraded to Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,13,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,7,14,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,7,15,Galaxy S III.
B008HTJLF6,7,16,Just ordered the S3 for my nephew.
B008HTJLF6,7,17,note - I do love a phone that takes good pictures and Samsung S3 does this really well and fast.
B008HTJLF6,7,18,I have very mixed feelings about the galaxy sIII but have found that most of the time this phone works great for me.
B008HTJLF6,7,19,I went through troubleshooting with both Samsung and Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,7,20,The Samsung S3 gives you more power for the price than any Iphone.
B008HTJLF6,7,21,Love it more than my old iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,7,22,Iphone Killer.
B008HTJLF6,7,23,Great phone but still no JB, Verizon!
B008HTJLF6,7,24,My daughter had an S3 and loved it, my other daughter has the Iphone 5 and though she loves it, she steered me toward the S3 as well.
B008HTJLF6,8,0,Verizon SIII.
B008HTJLF6,8,1,My phone works now in this area, but the verizon threads show there are many people for whom it didn't work.
B008HTJLF6,8,2,At least it was useful with WiFi when that was available.
B008HTJLF6,8,3,Its a great phone on every other carrier except Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,4,Other Verizon phones work perfectly here and never drop out of service.
B008HTJLF6,8,5,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,8,6,Verizon what the heck.
B008HTJLF6,8,7,Verizon version is no good, Verizon will not fix.
B008HTJLF6,8,8,In many areas where my previous phone had a good signal, this phone had none.
B008HTJLF6,8,9,If you like this phone, you will be better off getting it on AT&T; or T-Mobile's network, because they have not crippled the software.
B008HTJLF6,8,10,Customer support for activation was also very good.
B008HTJLF6,8,11,If you want a phone for wifi connection and making calls, get something else.
B008HTJLF6,8,12,Give us freedom Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,13,T9 trace/swype works well.Cons1.
B008HTJLF6,8,14,This has been the worst phone I have had with Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,15,LOLThis the same phone as Sprint AT&T; and T Mobile but Verizon changed the software crippling it's potential and ruining an otherwise good phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,16,Not what Hyped up to be on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,17,Lovely phone, But Verizon should keeps its butt out of my phone, and stick with just providing me cell service.
B008HTJLF6,8,18,I bought this phone and within 24 hours I was back at the Verizon store doing a return!!!
B008HTJLF6,8,19,I get more dropped calls.
B008HTJLF6,8,20,The S3 is a great phone for people on other carriers.
B008HTJLF6,8,21,Showed weak cell reception in areas of weak signal.
B008HTJLF6,8,22,NEW Verizon customer and already feel locked down.
B008HTJLF6,8,23,Verizon sucks.
B008HTJLF6,8,24,Needless to say, this is not a phone (on Verizon's network at least) that I would recommend to anyone planning on European travels.
B008HTJLF6,9,0,Lightning fast browser...Awesome!
B008HTJLF6,9,1,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,2,Lightning fast 4G LTE.
B008HTJLF6,9,3,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,9,4,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,5,Still a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,6,Upgraded to Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,9,7,Great phone but still no JB, Verizon!
B008HTJLF6,9,8,Verizon version is no good, Verizon will not fix.
B008HTJLF6,9,9,I was able to get the Galaxy S3 for $29.99.
B008HTJLF6,9,10,Great, right?
B008HTJLF6,9,11,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,9,12,Love my Samsung Galaxy SIII.
B008HTJLF6,9,13,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,9,14,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,9,15,I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2, and even though that was a good phone, this one really shows how slow that phone was.
B008HTJLF6,9,16,It uses a dual core processor in the US version while offering a quad core everywhere else in the world.
B008HTJLF6,9,17,Best phone ive ever owned.
B008HTJLF6,9,18,The Galaxy S3 is a 4.0.3
B008HTJLF6,9,19,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,9,20,Very pleased with my device.
B008HTJLF6,9,21,Just give me android.
B008HTJLF6,9,22,The processor on the US version of this phone is the dual core Qualcomm Krait 1.5ghz and it's excellent for running just about anything you need it to with top notch speed!
B008HTJLF6,9,23,It's amazingly fast and so many features.
B008HTJLF6,9,24,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,10,0,I love my new phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,1,I love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,2,I loved that!!
B008HTJLF6,10,3,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,10,4,LOVE IT!!
B008HTJLF6,10,5,I Love It.
B008HTJLF6,10,6,Love it!
B008HTJLF6,10,7,got it and LOVED IT!!!
B008HTJLF6,10,8,Loved it.
B008HTJLF6,10,9,With a little explanation I think it would be easy enough for newbies also.
B008HTJLF6,10,10,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,11,I still love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,12,I have to say I love my phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,13,Love my phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,14,I love it!
B008HTJLF6,10,15,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone when it is working properly.
B008HTJLF6,10,16,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,17,Love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,18,Love my new phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,19,There are some cool features, but I don't love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,20,Love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,21,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,10,22,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,10,23,I love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,24,I love my phone and only have 2 gripes:1.
B008HTJLF6,11,0,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,11,1,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,11,2,I wish the power button wasn't directly across from the volume rocker.
B008HTJLF6,11,3,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,4,The only downside is that the lock button is on the right side of the phone directly across from the volume toggle button that also controls the ringer volume/vibrate/silent status and not on the top of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,5,Don't bother being particular about the color.
B008HTJLF6,11,6,Wish the power button was on the top, it would make it easier.
B008HTJLF6,11,7,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,11,8,Everything is very user friendly.
B008HTJLF6,11,9,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,11,10,There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,11,11,I've turned the phone off or on many times when all I wanted to do was adjust the volume.-
B008HTJLF6,11,12,The power and volume buttons are cheap feeling, yes, but solid and easy to find.
B008HTJLF6,11,13,Could just be personal preference as I'm used to the power button on top on the Droid.
B008HTJLF6,11,14,So all your friends information is straight at your fingertips.I like the phone's swype feature while texting when I can't use both hands for whatever reason or I don't want to turn down the volume but want to quietly text.The phone's ringer is loud.
B008HTJLF6,11,15,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,11,16,I find that I couldn't reach the top left 25% of the screen when using with one hand.
B008HTJLF6,11,17,This placement has caused me to unintentionally change the ringer status while trying to lock the phone given how I hold the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,18,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,11,19,The GS2 had a settings menu that allowed users to tweak brightness, contrast, tint and saturation.
B008HTJLF6,11,20,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,11,21,I also like the blue color.
B008HTJLF6,11,22,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,11,23,I like having a dedicated menu button and the lack of such hardware-based menu button on the iPhone made it a frustrating experience for me.
B008HTJLF6,11,24,I wish the icons were nicer, but I'm finding out "there's an app for that" so at least I know I can change them if I'd like.
B008HTJLF6,12,0,So a great value for money.
B008HTJLF6,12,1,I think the stylus was a waste of money, though.
B008HTJLF6,12,2,I've gotten quite good at typing on this phone and enjoy using it for internet browsing and the like.
B008HTJLF6,12,3,When it comes to email and texting this phone will drive you crazy.
B008HTJLF6,12,4,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,12,5,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,12,6,Great phone for everything!
B008HTJLF6,12,7,I chose the GS3 over the GS4 because the price has dropped so much and I am trying to save money.
B008HTJLF6,12,8,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,12,9,Also, after 12 years with unlimited data, Verizon now insists on charging for  data usage.
B008HTJLF6,12,10,Still a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,12,11,Also it's hard to enjoy the 4g speed because it eats data like CRAZY and verizon just took away the unlimited data plans unlike Sprint.
B008HTJLF6,12,12,I can surf the web and play games on it.
B008HTJLF6,12,13,A heavier user might want to move up to the IV, but for my level (primarily calls, calendar, email, searching internet on a basic level) this is perfect.
B008HTJLF6,12,14,The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen.
B008HTJLF6,12,15,I will never use their money grubbing built in apps, but you can't delete them!
B008HTJLF6,12,16,I can usually spend a total of 8 hours total with non-stop internet use (Facebook, Twitter, browser, etc) and get down to about a 30% battery.
B008HTJLF6,12,17,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,12,18,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,12,19,My first smartphone, so I may be naive, but everything has been very easy to use and to access.
B008HTJLF6,12,20,Send about 7 or 8 emails, 10-12 tests, and made about 80 minutes worth of phone calls.
B008HTJLF6,12,21,It has been excellent for me.Overall, this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,12,22,I simply love it.
B008HTJLF6,12,23,Good phone for me.
B008HTJLF6,12,24,No need to write anything else.Entertainment: Freaking awesome for music, movies, seriously anything.
B008HTJLF6,13,0,My screen stills goes dark unless I touch the screen to keep it.
B008HTJLF6,13,1,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,13,2,Glass cracks very easily.
B008HTJLF6,13,3,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,13,4,The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.
B008HTJLF6,13,5,I have small hands, and yeah, it does get a bit difficult to use the big screen sometimes, but I'm certainly not going back to a screen any smaller than this.
B008HTJLF6,13,6,Horrible, cheap Plastic casing & a screen that cracks if you sneeze too hard!
B008HTJLF6,13,7,Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.
B008HTJLF6,13,8,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,13,9,Since its so thin, its susceptable to cracked screens and broken corners when dropped.
B008HTJLF6,13,10,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,13,11,Entire screen shattered, despite the fact it was in an Incipio case.
B008HTJLF6,13,12,Takes me a bit to find where everything is and how it works but things are coming together.
B008HTJLF6,13,13,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,13,14,If you must have this phone, take along a silicone or heavy duty case because one tiny drop can mean a disaster.
B008HTJLF6,13,15,I did eventually get a screen protector after about 6 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,13,16,99% of the time it doesn't and I have tried it in all kinds of light, both with and without glasses.
B008HTJLF6,13,17,That is pretty damn cool.
B008HTJLF6,13,18,The other phones mentioned are both tasteful and lightning fast in getting to the home screen from the phone being off Verizon models are slow to get to the home screen and then blind you with a bright white screen with tacky red purple lime green circles and an annoying bell sound.
B008HTJLF6,13,19,This happened without any mistreatment, dropping, or irregular use.
B008HTJLF6,13,20,This isn't a big enough problem to reject the phone though.
B008HTJLF6,13,21,The larger screen of the S3 is fine but the extra bulk makes it just a bit large for my hands.
B008HTJLF6,13,22,I bought this phone 5 days ago and already the glass over the camera has shattered.
B008HTJLF6,13,23,So much for gorilla glass.I think the basic problem is that the glass is compressed in the frame and that it sticks out from it.
B008HTJLF6,13,24,;)Maybe next year they will let people have a four and a half inch screen!!!  Dare to dream
B008HTJLF6,14,0,The phone comes pre-loaded with Android 4.0.4
B008HTJLF6,14,1,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,14,2,I have a LOT of apps.
B008HTJLF6,14,3,Just give me android.
B008HTJLF6,14,4,Also, although the market is catching up, there are still some apps available on the apple market that are not available on the Google play store.
B008HTJLF6,14,5,the time to market for these updates through Verizon is just unacceptable.
B008HTJLF6,14,6,if you were an iphone user it will take few days to get used to android os. after that you won't look back.
B008HTJLF6,14,7,Until Verizon upgrades the software to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this app cannot be downloaded or used.
B008HTJLF6,14,8,My only complaint is that Samsung should not deviate too much from google android.
B008HTJLF6,14,9,I like the android system and haven't used an iphone to compare it to.
B008HTJLF6,14,10,update:  I upped this to zero stars from -1 stars since they updated the software.
B008HTJLF6,14,11,Don't get me wrong i'm an android lover and really support all the great opportunities with android phones but compared to the newest Iphone 5 this phone does lack a little.
B008HTJLF6,14,12,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,14,13,Ice Cream Sandwich, and is the Verizon is the only major carrier that hasn't updated their phones yet.
B008HTJLF6,14,14,Wicked.Fully customizable....for sure.Open android market  with lots of free apps that are not garbage.
B008HTJLF6,14,15,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,14,16,The iPhone is, well, an iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,14,17,I run a lot of apps and didn't notice any difference in performance.
B008HTJLF6,14,18,With that being said I am also very particular about background apps and services running so I usually don't allow GPS, Bluetooth, etc to run in the background all day.
B008HTJLF6,14,19,i have disabled a number of apps that may be running in the background, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.
B008HTJLF6,14,20,I love the large screen, the operating system and the ease of updating my contacts list.
B008HTJLF6,14,21,which does pare with the Nissan Altima navigation system.
B008HTJLF6,14,22,While I love the phone my next phone will be a Google Nexus phone which get updates as soon as Google finishes them, even if that means switching mobile providers.
B008HTJLF6,14,23,I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).
B008HTJLF6,14,24,Until Sammy sends out a software update to fix the problem, I have disabled the auto-brightness feature.Software ImplementationThe user interface for this latest version of touchwiz is really very nice.
B008HTJLF6,15,0,I bought this phone about a month or so ago and have a very different perspective.
B008HTJLF6,15,1,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,15,2,This was about a year ago.
B008HTJLF6,15,3,Highly recommend it.
B008HTJLF6,15,4,This phone does everything exponentially better.
B008HTJLF6,15,5,I Love It.
B008HTJLF6,15,6,I bought this phone for my son.
B008HTJLF6,15,7,So a great value for money.
B008HTJLF6,15,8,After 4 months the phone stopped charging and Amazon won't even take it back after one month.
B008HTJLF6,15,9,I've owned several Samsung phones of the past several years and have always been very pleased.I purchased this phone for use on Verizon's network.
B008HTJLF6,15,10,Less than two years after purchasing an HTC Incredible, which was a state of the art phone at the time, I decided to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy SIII a few weeks ago.
B008HTJLF6,15,11,Any high end Android device would be so much better with pure vanilla Android.But all in all, it's a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,15,12,I will probably buy the docking station.
B008HTJLF6,15,13,Recently I got the Samsung and he bought a new moto Droid.
B008HTJLF6,15,14,Great Android Device.
B008HTJLF6,15,15,I am extremely happy with this purchase.
B008HTJLF6,15,16,And with recent price drops, it comes almost free with a contract.
B008HTJLF6,15,17,a great purchase for me.not
B008HTJLF6,15,18,Much better than most of the phones I've had over the past 13 or so years.I really like Android 4.3.
B008HTJLF6,15,19,I've had mine for about a year, and it has really never given me any problems.
B008HTJLF6,15,20,BUY ONE TODAY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING IT.
B008HTJLF6,15,21,And I am locked into a 2 year contract!I would welcome suggestions.
B008HTJLF6,15,22,Renewed my contract with Verizon and only paid $20 for it!
B008HTJLF6,15,23,Love it more than my old iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,15,24,Overall, I expect to be very satisfied with this phone for the next 2 years.
B008HTJLF6,16,0,3 months after we got the phone it stopped charging.
B008HTJLF6,16,1,First off the phone has ultra poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,16,2,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,16,3,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,16,4,Within forty-eight hours, however, the phone had turned itself off and would not turn back on again.
B008HTJLF6,16,5,After a couple more calls a new charger and battery was sent to us.
B008HTJLF6,16,6,After 4 months the phone stopped charging and Amazon won't even take it back after one month.
B008HTJLF6,16,7,When the phone was returned it still wouldn't charge.
B008HTJLF6,16,8,Also bought a new battery to see if that was the issue....nope.
B008HTJLF6,16,9,With the new battery it started charging, but would drop phone calls a few minutes into a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,16,10,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,16,11,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,16,12,If I charge the phone over night and don't use it at all I will be at 78% by 11am.
B008HTJLF6,16,13,When the battery begins to fade and won't hold a charge as long as it once did I'll be able to purchase a new battery for a few dollars and pop it in.
B008HTJLF6,16,14,I had my first one replaced in less than a week because it wasn't updating and locking up 3-4 times a day and I had to remove the battery to get it to restart.
B008HTJLF6,16,15,Battery life is just so so, to me it's over hyped, although i'm on it alot, probally 3.5-4.5 hours of On Screen time a day.
B008HTJLF6,16,16,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,16,17,But one day my screen turned off and it never came back.
B008HTJLF6,16,18,I have no issues yet, 3 months usage.
B008HTJLF6,16,19,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,16,20,Seems it's on the charger more than anything else.
B008HTJLF6,16,21,It definitely makes in through a day without any problems, even with reasonably heavy use, but I've never been able to take it for two whole days without having to charge it up on day 2.  Still, with a user replaceable battery, you could always keep a spare on hand and switch between the two if need be.
B008HTJLF6,16,22,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,16,23,Thankfully my replacement doesn't lock up but the battery life and inability to make outgoing calls make this phone completely useless.
B008HTJLF6,16,24,Now that I've used this phone for a couple of months.
B008HTJLF6,17,0,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,17,1,People say my voice has a mechanical muffled quality, and their voices to me have a fuzzy, rasping quality.
B008HTJLF6,17,2,If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,3,With the phone synced to the car via bluetooth, when the phone rings, I hear the ring through the car speaker assigned by the car bluetooth for the phone.
B008HTJLF6,17,4,The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.
B008HTJLF6,17,5,The standard bluetooth is able to determine if the connection is for phone only or phone and audio.
B008HTJLF6,17,6,Hard to like a phone that can't make a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,17,7,I get more dropped calls.
B008HTJLF6,17,8,When I want to listen to music on my phone, I connect the audio plug to the car stereo aux plug.
B008HTJLF6,17,9,When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,10,Yet, I was getting very decent quality calls (clear, but a bit tinny sounding).
B008HTJLF6,17,11,This phone works fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,17,12,The voice quality could be better, the phone often distorting the audio when its loud enough to hear the other party.
B008HTJLF6,17,13,Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.
B008HTJLF6,17,14,You can hear your callers clearly and loudly.
B008HTJLF6,17,15,I could hear the person on the other end, but they couldn't hear me (dead silence).I hadn't muted the microphone, I hadn't covered it with my hand, I had the volume advanced, I called several different phones and I tried the speaker phone all to no avail.
B008HTJLF6,17,16,A call to Samsung tech support revealed that the bluetooth phone audio will not work when the audio plug is accessed for the aux stereo.
B008HTJLF6,17,17,Great Phone with one glitch.
B008HTJLF6,17,18,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,17,19,You may have turned off the volume of the phone unknowingly so that you may not hear a phone call coming in.The other thing is the built-in Samsung Swype-like keyboard.
B008HTJLF6,17,20,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,17,21,Bluetooth music to my car stereo stutters.
B008HTJLF6,17,22,It never lags or makes me wait for anything.Call quality- I am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because I have experienced very good call quality.
B008HTJLF6,17,23,I know that this phone does have version 4.0 bluetooth.
B008HTJLF6,17,24,One, as the other reviewer mentioned, several people told me I sounded like i was calling from inside a hollow box.
B008HTJLF6,18,0,Camera is better than my other phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,1,It is way much more better than iPhone4S.
B008HTJLF6,18,2,If you actually expect your phone to function well as a phone, this isn't for you.
B008HTJLF6,18,3,Depending on the shot, the camera on the GS3 (and photo quality in general) is very comparable to photo quality on the Nokia 808  and iPhone 4S.Video quality is on par with the photo quality.
B008HTJLF6,18,4,Yes, it does everything it is advertised to do, except one little thing...it can't make a quality phone call.
B008HTJLF6,18,5,Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.
B008HTJLF6,18,6,Great phone, terrible camera.
B008HTJLF6,18,7,These batteries performed as good or better than OEM and had NFC capabilities.
B008HTJLF6,18,8,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,18,9,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,18,10,Unfortunately, I take a lot of pictures, and wish I had realized this before buying this phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,11,This phone is horrible at it's most basic function!
B008HTJLF6,18,12,Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.
B008HTJLF6,18,13,Battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,18,14,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,18,15,But one day my screen turned off and it never came back.
B008HTJLF6,18,16,The ability to customize my phone is invaluable to me, which is why I always choose Android over Apple.Camera8-megapixel rear camera, 1.9-megapixel front camera.
B008HTJLF6,18,17,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,18,18,It sucks when you compare even with iPhone4S.
B008HTJLF6,18,19,Two problems.
B008HTJLF6,18,20,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,18,21,:)  The batter life on the GS3 seems pretty decent.
B008HTJLF6,18,22,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,18,23,Some nice new features (Smart Stay - works about 75% of time but is still pretty nifty).
B008HTJLF6,18,24,The HTC One X has a sharper, brighter screen and a camera that is on par with the GSC's.
B008HTJLF6,19,0,No Sim Card Error.
B008HTJLF6,19,1,I am two phones and two SIM cards later, and the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,19,2,I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar.
B008HTJLF6,19,3,You can't download/install/move applications to your SD card.
B008HTJLF6,19,4,Nowhere in the description does it indicate this does NOT come with the SIM card.
B008HTJLF6,19,5,This was a steal.Cons - can be a little glitchy at times, apps stopping, having to reformat my sd card, etc.
B008HTJLF6,19,6,If I have an application on my phone and it goes bad, I want to be assured that the data is still retrievable on the SD card.
B008HTJLF6,19,7,I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3.
B008HTJLF6,19,8,Read that some people had some "No-Sim Card" error.
B008HTJLF6,19,9,I bought two of these on a family plan and we both have problems with the phone giving an error "No SIM Card" which renders the phone useless.
B008HTJLF6,19,10,Default your music and photos to be stored on the SD card and you're golden.
B008HTJLF6,19,11,"NO SIM" error, all the time.
B008HTJLF6,19,12,We received the phone this morning and it is missing the SIM card and the back cover.
B008HTJLF6,19,13,With the 4.3 update, you can move some apps to SD cards- without, you can only put pictures and media.The software is what kills this phone.
B008HTJLF6,19,14,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,19,15,Even the fixes out there for the dropped service and no sim error stuff don't seem to always work.
B008HTJLF6,19,16,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,19,17,Do not buy this phone if you want to use it as a phone!Update:  Tried new sim card, got new phone, many service calls, verizon just keeps putting me off each time.
B008HTJLF6,19,18,Bought this phone for work purposes, and it gives me a no sim card error right away and it's blocking me from using the phone, so this is nothing more than a $600 paper weight at this point...
B008HTJLF6,19,19,I told my Indian friend that indeed the phone has a built in 16GB RAM and what I was inquiring about the non-present SIM card.
B008HTJLF6,19,20,microSD card slot + 16GB of internal storage.
B008HTJLF6,19,21,Phone does not work properly on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,19,22,It all goes to the on-board system memory.
B008HTJLF6,19,23,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,19,24,The phone works flawlessly with many fine features, most I don't use....yet.
B008HTJLF6,20,0,I had one of these phones for a few days before I returned it.
B008HTJLF6,20,1,So now they are sending me a return shipping lable and I have to wait to get a replacement by UPS...
B008HTJLF6,20,2,I returned it after 3 days.
B008HTJLF6,20,3,Can't even return it.
B008HTJLF6,20,4,I like the phone when it works, but the Samsung support model is such a disaster that I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
B008HTJLF6,20,5,Both phones I purchased from here were water damaged in box when received and on one, the GPS did not even work.
B008HTJLF6,20,6,I did not receive a new product when it did not state I was getting a refurbed phone, very disappointed I will never buy from Amazon wireless again.
B008HTJLF6,20,7,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,20,8,2-3 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,20,9,price if I wanted to have them send me the phone before they received the dud phone.
B008HTJLF6,20,10,Once again we had to send it to Texas for repair.
B008HTJLF6,20,11,We waited for more than 2 weeks while it was "repaired" in Texas.
B008HTJLF6,20,12,When the phone was returned it still wouldn't charge.
B008HTJLF6,20,13,The person I spoke with at amazon was very helpful but couldn't do anything else.
B008HTJLF6,20,14,I have to send phone back first but would have to pay the "full" $600.
B008HTJLF6,20,15,Just replaced old phone.
B008HTJLF6,20,16,Phones came water damaged and GPS did not work.
B008HTJLF6,20,17,After 4 months the phone stopped charging and Amazon won't even take it back after one month.
B008HTJLF6,20,18,Exchange is terrible... Purchased two of these phones.
B008HTJLF6,20,19,I tried to get Amazon to send me a device in advance and return packaging for the old one.
B008HTJLF6,20,20,I didn't move from a 2 year old HTC product to the flagship Samsung product in order to have to reboot my device 3 to 5 times a day just to make basic functions work.1.
B008HTJLF6,20,21,Think twice about ordering a phone thru amazon wireless...I sure won't ever again!!!This is a follow up review...this is why I changed the star rating too...I have to say, after sending the phone back Amazon wireless quickly sent the replacement phone out to me...received it much quicker than I thought...their customer service was helpful and friendly too...
B008HTJLF6,20,22,So now I have to exchange the phone which is back ordered in all colors.
B008HTJLF6,20,23,With the new battery it started charging, but would drop phone calls a few minutes into a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,20,24,Amazon would not work out anything with Verizon to get a phone from their store at this price so will not have phone for approx.
B008HTJLF6,21,0,Do not buy this phone if you want to use it as a phone!Update:  Tried new sim card, got new phone, many service calls, verizon just keeps putting me off each time.
B008HTJLF6,21,1,Never once did they acknowledge that this phone has problems.
B008HTJLF6,21,2,Hard to like a phone that can't make a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,21,3,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,21,4,My phone works now in this area, but the verizon threads show there are many people for whom it didn't work.
B008HTJLF6,21,5,We have already received a replacement phone from Verizon but the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,21,6,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,21,7,you know about these problems?
B008HTJLF6,21,8,Verizon would not let me e-mail customer service about it from their website.
B008HTJLF6,21,9,It was in reference to a review that chastised other reviewers for giving bad reviews to the phone because of Verizons modifications."In
B008HTJLF6,21,10,At the same time and place, I had no problem placing and receiving calls on two inexpensive Verizon cell phones.
B008HTJLF6,21,11,On top of that Verizon customer service has been steadily deteriorating over the years.
B008HTJLF6,21,12,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,21,13,It took countless hours on the Verizon store and on the phone with Verizon to get the phone replaced.
B008HTJLF6,21,14,I like the phone when it works, but the Samsung support model is such a disaster that I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
B008HTJLF6,21,15,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,21,16,I was not under contract so I just returned it cancelled my  service with Verizon.Why Verizon???  Fire whoever is in charge over there.
B008HTJLF6,21,17,Verizon bent over backwards trying to help.
B008HTJLF6,21,18,After hours on the tech support line with Verizon they told me just to go back to the store and get a replacement.
B008HTJLF6,21,19,Of course the verizon rep hasn't called me back in "two days" either.
B008HTJLF6,21,20,Everywhere else I have been in San Diego, I get exceptional service.
B008HTJLF6,21,21,I rarely dropped calls and had service everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,21,22,Now the second phone on the plan is having the same problem.
B008HTJLF6,21,23,We were pretty much told that this is not their problem, it's the manufacturer's problem.
B008HTJLF6,21,24,Sure, buy the phone, just don't get the verizon version.
B008HTJLF6,22,0,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,22,1,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,2,But still not as smooth as say an iPhone or Nexus.
B008HTJLF6,22,3,Great Android Device.
B008HTJLF6,22,4,I had come to expect this from almost all Android devices, until I installed pure vanilla android with a custom ROM.
B008HTJLF6,22,5,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,22,6,However, I have no issues with the speed of my S3.
B008HTJLF6,22,7,With a dual core (US) 1.5 GHz processor, and 2 gigs (US) of RAM this thing will be future proof for the next two years that you own it.
B008HTJLF6,22,8,Don't get me wrong i'm an android lover and really support all the great opportunities with android phones but compared to the newest Iphone 5 this phone does lack a little.
B008HTJLF6,22,9,From what can be gathered on the internet, the S3 will still be supported with software updates at least through the next Android version 4.2.2 (and maybe further).
B008HTJLF6,22,10,Still in order to differentiate its products from other Android device makers; Samsung is skinning it's products with Touchwiz UI.
B008HTJLF6,22,11,It's hard to enjoy 4g speed with Verizon, You might be better off with Sprint instead.
B008HTJLF6,22,12,Even if you genuinely do like Touchwiz's look, it still slows down the phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,13,Weaker Reception - When on 3G, data speed is slower than my 3G - HTC .
B008HTJLF6,22,14,Data speeds are fast both with WiFi and 4G.
B008HTJLF6,22,15,You cannot judge a phone on hardware or software alone but how the two work together and the experience this Synergy provides.
B008HTJLF6,22,16,Especially when you compare it to the paperweight HTC Incredible.
B008HTJLF6,22,17,i've owned two iphones before but this phone is really a better phone.bigger
B008HTJLF6,22,18,It's so buttery smooth and gives so much better and enjoyable experience to the user.
B008HTJLF6,22,19,But I have already moved on to aftemarket batteries (see Zero Lemon batteries) for my S3 and have seen improved battery life...Plus I have spare batteries to boot!Speed: The S4 has the latest and greatest quad core processor and 2G of memory, the S3 has a dual core processor and 2GB of memory, so if you are all about speed, then the S4 may be your best bet.
B008HTJLF6,22,20,It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor.
B008HTJLF6,22,21,I hated that I've had to go back to my HTC droid incredible 2.
B008HTJLF6,22,22,The HTC One X has a sharper, brighter screen and a camera that is on par with the GSC's.
B008HTJLF6,22,23,Do you really need the Galaxy S4? Maybe not.
B008HTJLF6,22,24,screen definitely improves user experience.
B008HTJLF6,23,0,I like when I am using text, you can swipe your fingers to the letters and it figures the word you want.
B008HTJLF6,23,1,I am still figuring things out about the phone but overall I really do like it.
B008HTJLF6,23,2,ABSOLUTELY GALAMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS DEVICE IS ALWSUM JUST TO SAY THE LEAST.
B008HTJLF6,23,3,I'm typing this review on my phone right now.
B008HTJLF6,23,4,Was still hard to type / text with one hand vs. 2.
B008HTJLF6,23,5,Most of the cons result from Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,23,6,It was very easy, I brought the phone to my local Verizon store and they got me all set up.
B008HTJLF6,23,7,Oh it's Samsungs fault, they wanted to lock the bootloader... Ok Verizon get real, there are three other U.S. Carriers and ALL three of them have the SGSIII bootloader UNLOCKED, if this was the case, I'm pretty sure Samsung would have kept it that way across the board.
B008HTJLF6,23,8,The product arrived on-time and works mostly as advertised.But it's the dealing with Verizon that always sours an experience.
B008HTJLF6,23,9,Thirty tries later I concluded that the most important function of a cell phone was missing.
B008HTJLF6,23,10,I'm going to tell you my specific reasons for giving this phone 2 stars after having it for 2 months.I can boil it down to one thing then list specifics - the one thing is certain things stop working and can only be fixed by a reboot of the device.
B008HTJLF6,23,11,I reset the phone and started over; same problem.
B008HTJLF6,23,12,I tried several tricks folks reported using on other forums to solve this problem (I'm not alone apparently); still no luck.Talked with Amazon Wireless and Verizon on a three way conversation this morning.
B008HTJLF6,23,13,I didn't move from a 2 year old HTC product to the flagship Samsung product in order to have to reboot my device 3 to 5 times a day just to make basic functions work.1.
B008HTJLF6,23,14,Takes me a bit to find where everything is and how it works but things are coming together.
B008HTJLF6,23,15,I did not receive a new product when it did not state I was getting a refurbed phone, very disappointed I will never buy from Amazon wireless again.
B008HTJLF6,23,16,It was in reference to a review that chastised other reviewers for giving bad reviews to the phone because of Verizons modifications."In
B008HTJLF6,23,17,Instead, all they have to do is delay for a couple of years because most buyers will have acquired another phone by then under their carrier's update programs.In short, this seems to be yet another case of an electronics manufacturer using the consumer to do its beta testing or themselves doing abbreviated beta testing so that they could rush this phone to market.
B008HTJLF6,23,18,BUY ONE TODAY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING IT.
B008HTJLF6,23,19,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,23,20,Yes, it does everything it is advertised to do, except one little thing...it can't make a quality phone call.
B008HTJLF6,23,21,Apple is clearly the most greedy company in the world but Verizon is up there too!
B008HTJLF6,23,22,No Verizon SIM card, which is basically the personality chip that makes the device a Verizon phone (as advertised by Amazon) as opposed to a vanilla device.
B008HTJLF6,23,23,NEW Verizon customer and already feel locked down.
B008HTJLF6,23,24,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,24,0,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,24,1,Do all phones with non-replaceable batteries have a hard reboot option, and do they always work?Two niggling things -- The placement of the on/off button and volume up/down buttons are about on opposite sides about 2/3rds way up the sides of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,2,Many times, when I click on the on button, nothing happens, had to do multiple times or take out the battery.6)
B008HTJLF6,24,3,Reboot of phone fixes it every time.7.
B008HTJLF6,24,4,Apps stop responding - freeze up - screen sticks for 15-20 seconds sometimes.
B008HTJLF6,24,5,enough where you have to wait a few seconds before the next app can do what it needs to.
B008HTJLF6,24,6,Only fix I have found is to reboot the phone, and it works immediately.2.
B008HTJLF6,24,7,The only compliant I had was the lag when pressing the main home button.
B008HTJLF6,24,8,I reset the phone and started over; same problem.
B008HTJLF6,24,9,and secondly, and the biggest one, the placement of the buttons.
B008HTJLF6,24,10,Lots of times, just mashing the back button is easier than pushing the home button.On a positive side, the screen is gorgeous.
B008HTJLF6,24,11,For some reason I can't seem to figure out how to customize the phone screen so that when I choose the phone button it just goes to RECENT CALLS first.
B008HTJLF6,24,12,Their was a second or so delay when pressing the button, so I found out if you take the S-voice shortcut off this button the delay disappears.
B008HTJLF6,24,13,Every time my finger gets to the top bar it turns off, when i lift my finger away from the phone it turns back on.
B008HTJLF6,24,14,Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.
B008HTJLF6,24,15,im constantly opening task manager and shutting down apps so i can use other apps.
B008HTJLF6,24,16,And on my Palm Pre Plus, to delete things, you dragged them to the side of the screen.
B008HTJLF6,24,17,I have had to Factory reset my phone four times because of these incompatibility reasons.
B008HTJLF6,24,18,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,24,19,I'm going to tell you my specific reasons for giving this phone 2 stars after having it for 2 months.I can boil it down to one thing then list specifics - the one thing is certain things stop working and can only be fixed by a reboot of the device.
B008HTJLF6,24,20,Touchwiz strikes again, ruining lock screen widgets and still being a chore to deal with.
B008HTJLF6,24,21,In fact, one night I forgot to plug it in to recharge and there was still battery the next morning - 20%.I too was not liking the power switch on the right until I got a case, so holding the case I no longer press and hold the volume button, turning the volume all the way down.I too was not liking the power connector at the bottom, but have gotten used to it.
B008HTJLF6,24,22,I had to reset it once since I got it, and some of the upgrades for software confused me, but I took the time to figure them out.
B008HTJLF6,24,23,There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,24,24,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,25,0,If you want a phone for wifi connection and making calls, get something else.
B008HTJLF6,25,1,We cannot text or call.
B008HTJLF6,25,2,As soon as I hit "send" on a text message, or "CALL" to place a call, the phone drops out of service.
B008HTJLF6,25,3,Unfortunately, it's just not reliable for voice calls or text messaging, especially during peak times of the day.
B008HTJLF6,25,4,What's the point of having a phone if you can't place calls or send SMS messages?
B008HTJLF6,25,5,The issue only happens when you attempt to send a text or call, making it especially frustrating, as it interrupts whatever you are doing.
B008HTJLF6,25,6,This would cause the current text I was attempting to send, or the phone call I was trying to make, to fail.
B008HTJLF6,25,7,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,25,8,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,25,9,Now, we can sit next to each other on the couch and he has 3g and I can't even send a normal text message.
B008HTJLF6,25,10,When I attempt to make a voice call or text message, a good percentage of the time all 5 of my bars of service drop off, my 4gLTE symbol goes away and I get a "No Sim" message at the top of the screen.
B008HTJLF6,25,11,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,25,12,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,25,13,Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list.
B008HTJLF6,25,14,That's going easy on texts, emails, browsing the web and Bluetooth usage.
B008HTJLF6,25,15,I read emails throughout the day, calls, texts, occasional game, just everyday use.
B008HTJLF6,25,16,Don't get me wrong, it'll last you a whole day of playing a few games, browsing the web and updating your Facebook or sending emails.
B008HTJLF6,25,17,After several attempts you can eventually get your call or text to go out, but it sometimes takes a while.For a while I assumed this error only occurred when I was attempting to dial our or send a text, then I started getting voice mails out of the blue where people had called and it sent them straight to my voice mail.
B008HTJLF6,25,18,Poor call quality!
B008HTJLF6,25,19,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,25,20,VZ wanted twice as much and would have required a plan change.
B008HTJLF6,25,21,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,25,22,So I tried to get the phone to freeze, I simultaneously started updating and downloading my apps from my old phone, started opening apps, played YouTube video's, sending and receiving text messages, played with the camera, streamed movies from Netflix.
B008HTJLF6,25,23,Plus u can only send 2 pics at a time through text very disappointed at this phone I've had it one month and already went back to my iPhone 4.
B008HTJLF6,25,24,Straight out of the box it's easily accessible.You need a google account to set up your phone when you first turn it on.
