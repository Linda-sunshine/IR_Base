A1A018F333RAGX	1	1	I've been using this mouse for about two months now with no problems. I have not installed any software specifically for the mouse. I just let Windows Vista do its thing for driver installation.I had a Microsoft mouse that I bought 8 years ago that finally started acting up on me. I play a good number of click-heavy games (Aquaria, Heroes of Newerth, Starcraft 2, etc), so I wanted a mouse that had gotten favorable reviews from other gamers who use it like I do. That said, I haven't seen any evidence that this mouse is actually constructed specifically to handle heavy clicking more so than any other mouse from a good manufacturer.It's marketed primarily as a gaming mouse because of the extra buttons, which are programmable, though I haven't tried out that aspect. Two of the buttons are preset to raise and lower mouse speed, which can be useful for those FPS games where you need finer control as a sniper and faster mouse speed as another player class. To be honest, if you don't need the extra buttons, or you don't play games often, I highly suspect just about any mouse from a major manufacturer will do the trick.My only complaint is that I really hate the distorted metal look of the mouse. Lots of manufacturers try to create futuristic looking mice targeted towards gamers. I think there are a lot of successes in that area, but this is not one of them.Other than that, this mouse has been working great for me. We'll see how it holds up throughout the years.

A1A0GJYUB0DP8H	0	0	This whole movie was staged. There was absolutely nothing scary about it. One example, the history student (a girl) is eating a sandwich and it has a cockroach on it. She is being filmed showing the cockroach while holding the sandwich, but no one says a word about it to her. She finally takes a bite or two and pretends she has taken the roach into her mouth....but you never actually she it as she pretends to take it out and toss it across the room. Then, of course screams her lungs out. The whole movie is like this. The fireplace seen is even funnier with her.ADVICE: Don't waste your money or time with this movie, it isn't worth either.
A1A0GJYUB0DP8H	1	0	Before my wife and I actually purchased (2) 3x gel bicycle seat covers I read the reviews first. Seeing that sizing was important I measured our seats, which were slightly smaller than the size stated on the product description. However, when we received them and put them on they fit like a glove. I know they wouldn't ever fit a larger seat as indicated. Caution: In my opinion...it'll only fit a slightly smaller seat.Once installed, we tried them out. (Our rear-ends were still sore from the original seats that came on the bicycles.) The gel seats felt soooo much better and improved our cycling experience by 90%. It's still doesn't make it feel like we're sitting on a pillow by any means, but it's a significant improvement.Bottom line...we are happy with our purchase of our gel seats. To us they were worth the money.
A1A0O21VC8HL6K	1	1	PEOPLE are so stipid when they try to tell you how stipid this is!BECAUSE its not!IT bets the first one 10 times over.SO awsome I just want to cry!best game I ever played!BUT it gets boring if you don`t have friends to play it with.
A1A0O21VC8HL6K	1	1	Very good for its time and even now. It has so many things to do.I have had it for over 5yrs a long time.BUT if you have a xbox 360 buy oblivion!!!

A1A0SXK4WZXPNV	1	1	I do not live int the US, and ALWAYS everybody has been amazed on how useful these sweepers are. I take them every where I move!!!! I have 3, each one form different &#34;generations&#34; and I would not trade them for anything!! It would be great of they could vacuum over carpet... wishful thinking.
A1A0SXK4WZXPNV	1	1	All cupcakes cook evenly, it has the perfect size, and is its easy to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone, professionals, and amateurs.
A1A0SXK4WZXPNV	1	1	I have given this turtle as a gift twice, and moms, dads and babies have been delighted!!! It is nice that it has different color, it reflects well in the ceiling and provides a peaceful ambience. I totally recommend it! the perfect gift.
A1A0SXK4WZXPNV	1	1	I use it almost every day. It helps relieve my back at the end of a hard work day. The only thing I would say is that it wrinkles too much, but I guess that's in the end a good thing, it gives it malleability so it fits different areas of the body. It is quite easy to de-wrinkle though.
A1A0YVAFR2SJIQ	1	1	The Lives of Others is a moving portrayal of the inner conflict of a Stasi (state security) officer, who finds himself pursuing the personal whims of state leaders. Instead of merely standing by as the innocent are taken advantage of, the officer becomes enmeshed in the machinations with an unexpected ending.This is an emotionally moving tale, especially in light of the realistic portrayals of life in the "East" in the 1980's, and the profound changes that took place when the wall came down. However, it should not be watched with too critical an eye, as the awakening of the Stasi officer that plays center stage in the plot would only be possible if the officer in question was excessively naive, which in turn would make his advancement to the rank that he portrays in the film unlikely.Five stars, two thumbs up. I bought a second copy so that I can share it.
A1A0YVAFR2SJIQ	0	0	One shouldn't get to complain about having wasted time and money on a propaganda piece when the packaging already states a disclaimer: "From the company that brought you An Inconvenient Truth"But complain I will.This "documentary" is a brainwash session prepared by and for people who have blinders on. Like any true propaganda film, facts are mixed with inaccuracies and incomplete information, so that the viewer is left with a wrong impression of reality, or an unstated blatant lie.An example of incomplete information is the treatment of corn, and how it's used by Big Bad Businesses. The movie presents corn as the source of American obesity, without regard to the countless studies that show that primary causes for obesity are a dramatic increase in caloric intake and lack of exercise. The standard applied to causality between corn and obesity is such that one could equally well say that spoons are the cause for obesity in America.Strangely the "documentary" has no actual scientific experts offering opinions, perhaps because such interviews were not deemed necessary, or their content ran contrary to whatever agenda the producers have.One underlying tone is that Big Bad Corporations are out to get the farmer and the consumer, and that they are enabled by Bad Evil People, such as anyone appointed by President GW Bush. The producers don't seem to find it inconvenient to gloss over the fact that agricultural policies and the Big Bad Corporations depicted go back decades, not just the 8 years from 2001 to 2008, and that appointees of Presidents Clinton and Carter are of necessity engaging in the same Bad Evil activities.In short, save your money and time, unless you like your blinders firmly planted right where they are.
A1A0YVAFR2SJIQ	1	0	I'd call this interesting, thought provoking, but informative only to those who have been fully ignorant about the number and locations of genocides in the past decades.(personal opinion warning)Like so many other documentaries touching on this topic, this one yet again failed to review what happened _before_ the event. What is common among genocides? For example, why not mention that massacres are almost without fail preceded by governmental disarmament of the population? Is it so difficult to reflect on how many fewer would have been killed had they been able to defend themselves?(/pow)I would have given this 5 stars had it provided slightly more discussion about similarities of the events, not just the killers.

A1A1AUFT6OEU1I	0	1	The Omega ProjectBy Doctor RingThe first half of Dr. Ring's book is well worth reading because he collects data onUFO and NDE episodes and presents it unadorned with opinion. But in the secondhalf, it seems to me, he's most interested in his testing processes . As the lawyers sayto save time, let's stipulate that certain personality types are more apt to report anUFO or NDE. So what.How does this shed any light on the evidence of multiple simultaneous UFO sightings.Are all the cops, pilots, hikers and ordinary citizens sensitive's along with the RADARcircuitry?Dr. Edward Mack of Harvard, once a skeptic, held a conference with many UFO experiencersfrom all over the country, the world, in fact. Many reported identical characteristics of their eventsand Dr. Mack summarized in his book, Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens, the onlything we HAVE proved is dramatically similar events are happening that we do not yetunderstand. No testing needed.As for NDE's, ask the doctors who have "witnessed" such events. They'll tell you thesame thing.So if you're interested in testing mechanics, The Omega Project is the book for you.If you want more real evidence, ask NASA to release all their photos sans airbrush.
A1A1AUFT6OEU1I	1	1	I really enjoyed Gods of Eden by William Bramley and was impressed by its ambitious scope and detail. While each chapter was most informative, each could also inspire a lifetime of additional research so Bramley's hard question was how much depth was needed in order to support some reasonable conclusions about the impact of ETs on earthly events over time.Bramley sees that for centuries, ETs have been influencing the earth's people through the proxy of secret societies, financial powers and intelligence agencies. As proof, he cites how wars and lesser conflicts are ET-initiated so the governed stay too distracted to mount any revolt against ET control.He suggests that these never ending conflicts derive from a grand ET plan to keep the earth's people subjugated (as drone workers). He may be right about such a grand plan dictate but there are few examples (none) where grand plans hang together for centuries. Most grand plans self-destruct or become obsolete within a few years and since ETs have been visiting earth for thousands of years, I doubt they are following a grand plan.When any group of people assembles for some common interest like the local PTA, the church charity, the senior class prom planning committee, the "friendly" business golf tournament or chess club, conflicts soon devolve into two or more camps. Unrest is inevitable and, alas, it is more interesting than compliant alignment. When more powerful groups assemble (royalty, politicians, industrialists, church and financial powers) they clash earlier and more dramatically.On Madagascar, there are troops of monkeys that collect at their territorial boundaries every afternoon and scream at each other for an hour or so; then they fade back into their own areas and rest.The urge to invent conflict is compelling across every animal entity so incessant conflict alone does not mean that there must be one grand plan or that some one conductor is wielding a confrontational baton. Even semi reasoning minds easily find issues of conflict all by themselves.Many of the examples in GOE cite some provocateur or agency hyping unrest first on one side and then the other. Indeed, that does hint at a grand plan. But that ignores that many ambitious people will change colors mid-battle just to insure they end up on the prevailing side or otherwise benefit from the conflict. This self-serving trait, a form of greed, lives in all animal life.We who believe that ETs have been active participants in the lives of us earthlings for centuries are the products of overwhelming evidence. It's reasonable to assume there are at least a dozen different groups of visiting ETs. But the fact that they have advanced technology doesn't mean they are free from greed.We earthlings have also recently experienced a dramatic growth in advanced technology yet we still remain quite greedy. So it's more reasonable to assume that the visiting ET groups still have differing (greed) agendas that spawn conflict spontaneously. There's no need for a grand plan.For me, the imperfect behavior of people, tribes, nations and even ETs is the result of innate greed. On earth, the group most able to cause greed-driven conflict is the banking community. It is they who have the motive and influence to translate native greed into major conflict (war) since war feeds their interest much faster than peace.The other natural tendency humans have is their need to group with others. Children at play in the woods create a fort or camp, pretend it is a secret place and invent a password system. They group-up and get exclusive even at age eight or ten. Boys rarely grow into mature men. Watch any NFL game and see 50 year old men high-fiving when their team scores. Many are in the uniform jersey of their favorite player.It's not difficult for an alpha leader type to convert these group-up tendencies into an organized agenda in an us-against-them effort. So the unifying forces of greed and group-up are more to blame for our world's condition than the clever execution of a grand plan by ETs.The full disclosure and acceptance of UFO/ET existence can't be far away given the dramatically increased communication factor of the internet, the ubiquitous use of cell phone cameras and the evaporating nationalistic identities. Soon China or Brazil or the Vatican will take the initiative to acknowledge ETs. Congress will then quickly pass an immunity bill to forgive all the liars and black op participants for their deceptive obfuscations. There will be some panic and adjustment but our recent breakthrough technology has softened everyone's resistance to a sea change paradigm. "As long as I have a job and some food, who cares if there's an ET office on the next block?"Next it will be fashionable to buy into the ET Thing while the churches circle their wagons and, as before, invent compliant reasoning to re-map their dogmas to the new thing. Then it will be business as usual; meaning the bankers will continue to steer their ships by the starlight of greed. Gangs of thugs and financiers will still use secret signs and ceremonies. Politicians will adapt or be replaced.And the monkeys of Madagascar will argue every day as they have for centuries.None of these groups need a grand plan.
A1A1AUFT6OEU1I	1	1	James Tucker is one of those people that is interested in ALL of life. I know one when I see one because I am one too.We have an overdose of curiosity that is both wonderful and distracting - wonderful because we explore the esoteric andinane and distracting because we have too many hobbies and interests to ever absorb them fully.In Abra Cadaver we glimpse the doctor, writer, and magician and learn about medicine, murder and magic while Tuckerenriches events and mood with remarkable word pictures that bring his scenes alive.My too many hobbies include anatomy, magic and writing so I found the unique story compelling and exciting.I also learned about murder...inside and out.
A1A1AUFT6OEU1I	1	1	Simply the best book I've ever read.I'm reading it again to explore the fascinating trails it touches uponlike how genes impact history, migration, language, disease, learning,cures, cloning, IQ, aging, mad cow disease, insurance rates and cannibalism.I usually give good books I've read to my friends but Genome IS my friendnow so we'll be together for a few years.
A1A1BM6N28X9J0	1	1	love the size so you can write or type big for the adddress and looks so professional rather than just writing on the envelope. Sometimes I write them out by hand and other times I print them out on my laser jet printer so I can do different colors. Turns out great every time and no getting stuck or labels coming loose while printing. Feeds easily through the printer.
A1A1BM6N28X9J0	1	1	I was looking for something safe and easy to use to kill fleas. My cats got some and they are indoor only so the fleas must have been on something I brought in the house. I didn't want to fog the whole house so I washed the cats in flea shampoo, washed the throw rugs and bedding in hot water to kill them, then sprinkled this around the edges of the mattress in the room they sleep in & I sprinkled some very lightly on top of the mattress. I made the bed with a thin mattress pad as well as clean sheets and the next day there were 3 dead fleas in the mattress pads so it worked and for now my cats are not scratching. I'll do it again every 2 weeks for the next 6 weeks to be sure the fleas didn't leave eggs that will hatch later. Sure was a quick way to take care of it all, of course, I have all natural hardwood floors in my house throughout so no carpet for the fleas to have gotten into & I don't know if this item is safe to sprinkle on carpets because if your pets lick it maybe it would make them ill but I don't know so I wouldn't try that.
A1A1BM6N28X9J0	0	0	it was easy to assemble, it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that's all it did. The rabbits came last night, and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage. I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine. 10 1/2 hours later, all the 25 ft. row of collarobi (sp) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets. They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down. It DOESN'T work. All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray doesn't matter if it doesn't work and it doesn't.... I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in, coons and skunk and deer can't. Save your money............. put barbed wire around your garden...UPDATE: I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it, including the motor on the sprayer. I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES, I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing..... The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless...
A1A1BM6N28X9J0	1	1	everyones hair is different but the Matrix brand and Biolage and many other name brands I have tried make my hair look dirty no matter how hard I try to rinse it out. This conditioner on my hair leaves it feeling silky and fresh and shiny like when I was just a little girl. I am 60 and have been coloring my hair about every 5 to weeks for about 20 years now so I need something that keeps the moisture in and this does it better than any I've tried over the years and that has been many. Like I said, every hair type is different and even your water hardness makes a difference. I buy this anytime I can find it because I absolutly love it. I really can't afford it but I buy it anyway because it is that good....
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	At the beginning of the movie there is an aerial view of Heston's car going through the city streets. If you watch close enough you can see a crew member or someone running down a sidewalk as he passes through the supposedly empty city of daylight.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I was surprised at how funny this show was. I watched the Osbournes and I hate to say it but I just found the family to be annoying. On that show Ozzy's kids came off as annoying unlikeable kids. I expected this show to be even worse because of how Gene's always talking bad about Ace and Peter. I kind of expected that same negative image here. I was surprised to find that this is my favorite of any of the reality shows where celebrities are followed around. (Except maybe the Surreal Life shows). This was a great show. I enjoyed every episode as well as most of the extras. One thing that surprised me about the show is how the family sometimes makes fun of Gene and does stuff behind his back that they know he wouldn't want them doing. I knew Gene was obsessed with money but in this show you see that his obsession is really at a level that its a kind of psychological sickness.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	I expected to like Terror Planet better of the two Grindhouse films. I wasn't even sure I was going to buy Death Proof. In the end I liked the movie Death Proof BETTER than Terror Planet. I really felt like I was watching an old movie at a theater in the 70s when I watched this. I didn't feel like I was watching an old movie when I watched Terror Planet.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I bought this for a dollar at a local grocery store. I figured for a dollar it would be worth watching. To my surprise it was pretty decent. Vincent plays the last man role a little wimpier than Heston did in the Omega Man.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Rose McCowan looked better in this movie than I've ever seen her before. Where as Death Proof seemed like a movie from the early 70s, Terror Planet seemed like a movie from the early 80s. I didn't like it as much as Death Proof but I did like it. The DVD has plenty of extras which was not the case on the Death Proof DVD.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	This book has some interesting information in it that I've never came across anywhere else. It's not very well written though. It seemed like a self published book. The organization looks very chaotic in some places and I found many places where wrong words were used or words were misspelled. I can't imagine a reputatable publisher would send the book out like this but I could see someone self publishing it. I personally don't have a problem with all the mistakes. I kind of found it interesting finding them all. Sometimes mistakes cause the writer to seem like she's not really making a point. There was one part where she pointed out that the song Rock and Roll All Nite was spelled differently on a lable (I think). She stated (Rock and Roll All Nite) was misspelled Rock and Roll All Nite. I came across this mistake more than once. I found myself trying to figure out what the difference was when both the correct and suppossedly misspelled song titles were exactly the same. This book is kind of a book version of outsider art. It might not be professionally or skillfully executed but that doesn't mean it hasn't got something to offer. This book has some good stuff in it but you have to get past what I consider an unprofessional presentation.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	This was completely different than the movie. Actually I found it hard to believe they called the movie Logan's Run.Most of the events are different and many of the visual descriptions are also different. If someone made a movie based more closely on the book it would be unrecognizable as a Logan's Run remake. It was an interesting book but I found the writing style a little strange compared to what I normally read.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	I thought the book was good and didn't follow the normal formulate. Very dark and depressing. The only fault I found was that it was badly written. There were places where there was no period to mark the end of a sentence so that it seemed two sentences were one. This required me to go back and reread it as two sentences. I noticed these strange punctuation problems throughout and found it suprising since I've heard of other works by this author (Like FLETCH). There was one part where (I think) it was PICK spelled as PIKC. The story is good one but I was wondering while I was reading this if there was an editor for the book or if some company just took the author's first draft as is and printed it as a book.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I got this movie off of the SWAPADVD site figuring I would watch it and them put it back up for trade. Well, I've decided to keep this one. It's great. No extras, no commentary, nothing, but it's still a great DVD. This would make a good companion DVD for the POLLOCK movie. Watch POLLOCK and then follow it up by watching this. The end was a bit annoying. I caused me to dislike the woman who owns the painting. To be honest I think she's foolish and stubborn. Maybe in the beginning I could understand her reluctance to take an offer I would have taken in a second but at the end of the movie, what it says she does is just selfish and dumb. I had the feeling in watching this that fate had sent good fortune this woman but she's so foolish she messed it all up. If that painting had ended up in my hands instead of hers, it would be a totally different story.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Wow. It's not been long since this thing came out and it's already down to $3 as of this writing. That's real cheap real fast. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I loved the first one. That one was great and I've probably watched it six or seven times. The second, not so much. That one was garbage. I think this one is good. Erase APOCOLYPSE from the trilogy and go with the other two movies and you got a good set. I recommend this myself. I thought it was a pretty good movie.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	When I saw Rob's first movie, House of a 1000 Corpses, I didn't really like it. Had it not been a Rob ZOmbie film I wouldn't have even watched it all the way through. His next movie, Devil's Rejects, was a good movie that I would have watched all the way through but probably wouldn't have kept the movie for my personal collection. With Halloween, Rob has made a film that I would have wanted for my personal collection regardless of who directed it. Were as I kept the other two movies because I'm a Rob Zombie fan, I'm keeping my DVD of Halloween because I think it's a kick *ss movie. The story is completely different than the original movie and I like this story much better. I expected this movie to be a big let down because it's a remake of a classic horror film but this is one of those very rare cases where the remake outshines the original.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	This doesn't seem to be a real documentary as far as I can tell. It's just a bunch of badly edited video tape footage. If you're looking for a documentary about film making or selling a film you've made, go somewhere else. The fact that this thing didn't have a UPC# made even the package seem like a non-legit doc. I watch a lot of documentaries and don't even consider this a real documentary. Sorry. I feel bad since I bought it directly from the film makers but it's just not something people need to buy.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I thought this was a really great documentary. The quality looks like it was filmed with a consumer-level camcorder instead of a professional camera but that doesn't hurt the film in this case. This doc follows and tells the story of several mentally ill people who love movies more than anyone should. One guy saw 1000 movies in an 8-month period. If you enjoy docs about unsual people, you'll like this.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	0	0	I thought the original was okay. I could barely make it all the way through this one. Maybe I've developed some taste in movies since I saw the original. :-)
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	I loved this documentary. It's a real eye opener. I had a retired script analyst help me learn the basics of screenwriting and with my experience, I think the analysist in this movie is just milking the screenwriter for his money. Without actually reading their screenplays, these people seemed doomed to fail. Even though this is real and the people and events are real, I could easily imagine Christopher Guest and those people who made those movies like Waiting For Guffman, making this as a movie. Christopher Guest would be the guy who morgages his house to produce his screenplay into a movie. There was one scene where the one screenwriter was eating with his wife and daughter at a restaurant and all he could talk about was hold he was trying to get Teri Hatcher to read his script. The wife looked miserable. One guy in the film actually succeeds and gets his screenplay made into a movie called Behind The Mask but he pays a price.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	If you're a fan of either the movies of Stanley Kubrick or have an interest in film making, I'd recommend this. I love it. I expected it to be good, in that I love Clockwork Orange, 2001, the Shining and Full Metal Jacket, but this doc far exceeded my expectations.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	0	1	If you want to see a movie about the JOhn Lennon killing, get Chapter 27 with Jared Leto. It's much better. I have both this one and Chapter 27.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	0	0	This isn't worth the money. The ad files are impressive in the first place. You can change text and pictures but not the colors. Being able to change the color would have been a major glitch. Also, couldn't get it to play right when I embedded it with Serif's Webplus X2. Maybe I was doing something wrong. Anyway, I won't be using this product.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	0	0	I turned it off as soon as a Kardasian Sunrise drink was ordered by one of the characters. It really was unwatchable up to that point.April 24You people are really starting to rub me the wrong way. Only 1 in 11 people found this review helpful? really? Did you not appreciate how I cut to the chase and didn't waste your time by rambling on about non-sense.

A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I liked most, but not all of the movies in this set. I really liked the Death Riders documentary a lot. It alone was worth the price I paid for the set. I've gotten other sets with large collections of movies like this but many of those other sets were disappointing. This one has some good stuff on it.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I learned a lot about the story from the original book in this movie than I did from Let the Right One In. When I first heard they were gong to remake Let the Right One IN i figured it would be really bad but this is one of the very rare cases where I think the remake is as good, or in this case, even better, than the original. If I decide to watch the story again, which I will eventually, its more likely I'll watch Let Me In than Let the Right One IN.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Wow! This was a REALLY good documentary. Very interesting. I makes you want to read all of his works or, if you don't have time for that, at least rent a bunch of movies based on his works. Also, if you're a writer or aspiring writer, this inspires you to get back to working hard toward writing your own works if you're one of those writers who procrastinate and tend to put off sitting down and getting to work.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	0	1	This felt more like a video you'd watch just before someone asks if you can donate some money to their cause, that cause being the subject of the film you just watched. I regretted renting this. I love to watch documentaries but this one was just boring.NOTE:Hey fellow Amazonians. Hey, you think you could do me a favor and click on the helpful button. I'd like to bring my FOUND HELPFUL to NOT FOUND HELPFUL ratio up higher than it is now. Thanks ahead of time for helping me out.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Because I had never heard of this movie I expected it to be okay or not that great but it turned out to be a really good film. John Goodman was also very good in this film. Probably the best John Goodman role I've ever seen in a movie. There was a surprising turning point that really caught me off guard and it was just plain good all the way through.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Watching this feels like you're really there, like you really know these people and like you're wondering where you took a wrong turn in life that you have friends like this. Part of you wants to like them because of their quirkiness but ultimately you realize they're just plain ole white trash who have learned through the generations how to use the system and how to use the programs set up for the poor as a way of simply living. In man sums it up when he says "None of them have jobs but they've always got money".
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	Like the title says, it's like Cloverfield in the suburbs. You don't see as much direct interact with monsters as you do in cloverfield but you feel like you're watching real monsters. It movies where they use a lot of CGI, which they did in this movie, you're constantly being reminded that you're watching CGI effects. That was not the case with this movie. I didn't feel like the big monsters looked CGI and when I watched the bonus features I found out that a lot of stuff I through was real props was, in fact, CGI too. The DVD cover makes this movie look cheap but it's actually a good movie.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	There's some movies on here I didn't like at all like the Shark God movie and the silent movie but there are enough good movies like all the ones about marijuana to make this set well worth the money. The Child Bride movie was okay too. The marijuana movies are so good because of how over-the-top they make the effects of the drug seem. It's portrayed as crack x10. Anyway, if you can get if for the price I got it for ($5), it's a pretty good deal.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	0	I watched the 2 minute free preview of this movie and noticed they use the car / train crash scene from Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry at the beginning of this movie. What's funny is the parts that were different and leading up to the car crash I kept thinking to myself "That's just like the car from Diry Mary Crazy Larry. Then I saw the train and trought "and it's going to hit a train just like the car in Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" and then when it hit the train, the car exploded and crashed exactly the same as the one in Dirty Mary Crazy Larry. They had simply edited the graphics to make it look different but it was the same.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I wish this were available on DVD but I went ahead and took a chance and bought the streaming version instead of renting it and I'm glad I did. This is a really interesting documentary about the craft of writing. You probably would get as much perspective as a writer as you would if you took a creative writing class at a community college but here you get it all in one setting.
A1A1FKWM2MJ0B	1	1	I won't post a spoiler here but let me just say this about Title. Watching this DVD = Mind Blown. I mean WOW. What an experience. There's a certain scene, you'll know what I'm talking about it you watch the film, where, though I didn't allow myself to break down and cry, I won't lie, my eyes did get a little watery. And near the end, what a shocking twist. Did not see that one coming. I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. This is one of those movies you can't UN-WATCH, if you know what I mean.
A1A1K36HQ67W4	1	1	I've been using No. 7 car wash for years. It suds up nicely and melts bugs right off without removing your wax. I wouldn't use anything else. Price is very reasonable, too!
A1A1K36HQ67W4	1	0	I had reservations about purchasing this product because it seemed quite pricey. The deer had a habit of feeding off my English ivy and shrubs in the winter when their food supply was scarce. I sprayed the mix on my ivy and shrubs about once a week for 2 or 3 weeks. It smells so bad and so strong the deer stopped considering my place as a food source. I might have to use it a couple times to get through the winter. Be sure to wear rubber gloves when mixing, it's almost impossible to get the smell off your hands if you contact the mix. Excellent product.
A1A1K36HQ67W4	1	1	Bought as a gift. I had seen this movie a couple times and really enjoyed it. I highly recommend it to football fans.
A1A1SJYR9803RX	1	1	PRETTY GOOD DVD ON BEING IN THE MOMENT. I HAVE WATCHED THIS DVD AND LISTEN TO THEIR CD, INSTANTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION MANY TIMES. THEIR BOOKS ARE PRETTY GOOD AS WELL.
A1A1SJYR9803RX	1	1	SOLID, WELL MADE, WENT TOGETHER PRETTY EASY. GOOD PRICE . I THINK THE TOP 3 SPOTS WILL HOLD A LARGER BOTTLE OF WINE BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE RIGHT NOW TO TRY IT.
A1A1SJYR9803RX	1	1	THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN YOUR AVERAGE LOA MATERIAL. AFTER ONE VIEWING IT LOOKED SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT I NEED TO WATCH AGAIN TO GET MY MIND WRAPPED AROUND IT. IT'S EASILY WORTH THE $15, I HAVE THE BOOK AS WELL.
A1A1SJYR9803RX	1	1	At first it smelled a little like a freshly blacktopped road but the smell grows on you. Women may not care for the smell. It lathers up great and rinses off well.
A1A1SJYR9803RX	1	1	Just got this a few days ago. So far so good. Easy to see at a glance which mode the unit is in. The quick connect plug is easy to plug in and unplug compared to my Schumacher XM1-5. The Schumacher XM1-5 switches between 6 volt and 12 volt and has twice the charge amperage but is also about 3 times the size of the BT Junior.
A1A1WCE5BWJMZN	1	1	I concur with the initial reviewer. Roman spends enough time so that you have a feel for the openings. An excellent video in comparison with the Polgar videos (which are the only other ones I own).
A1A1WCE5BWJMZN	0	0	This is not a good value as described in the other 1 star reviews. The a typical "plan" for each opening is described in a very short (2-3 minutes) monologue by Ms Polgar. No principles just a lightning fast run through of the moves. Very disappointing. Worse as is pointed out in one of the more comprehensive 1 star reviews the 5 star comments appear to be cut and pasted by someone trying to sell these videos. I greatly prefer the Roman's lab videos.
A1A1WCE5BWJMZN	1	1	I have read a number of books on Time Management. This is one of the earliest but I still think it's the best. Get your long term priorities straight, prioritize your daily To Do list and work it--simple and effective. I tried the Getting Things Done method and it was terribly cumbersome so I was surprised by the GTD recommendation in the 2 star reviews.
A1A1WCE5BWJMZN	1	1	Really gives you an understanding of the plans that will lead to success with these openings. He gives you both the what to do and why. This was the first of his videos I purchased and while they are all quite good I think this may be the best. You'll play much less elsewhere and avoid the truly excessive shipping costs.
A1A25VSVSGHBLS	0	1	Very funny in that bad film sort of way. It was a lot of fun to see Jennifer Aniston early in her career.
A1A29TVSQ1UTPC	0	0	Did not enjoy or appreciate this book. Left me feeling antsy and irritated and furious, like its main character. Coulda done that on my own (in fact, it might have been inevitable). I suppose on some level the book connected with me, but it gave me little to work with beyond my own angst. Start again, and make your next book as unlike this one as possible. Please.
A1A29TVSQ1UTPC	1	1	I am shocked by the hateful intolerance of many of the reviewers of this beautifully written and sensitive inquiry into the minds of dogs. You all deserved to be spayed, neutered, have your tails and ears cropped, and be put on a leash.
A1A2B4MPF3FZYN	0	0	I was so looking forward to having this toy for my cat who lives solo since the loss of his sister. Because he no longer has a playmate I wanted to give him some exercise and fun. He loved this toy, but alas, the string which is used as the "fishing line" is of such poor quality that it barely lasted through two or three hours of playtime. I have tried repairing the broken string by tying it back onto the remaining piece, but as soon as he slaps at it, it breaks again. This would be an axcellent toy IF they were to use a stronger string. As it is, this toy - a great idea - is worth about $1.98. I am very disappointed and would advise others to save their money.
A1A2B4MPF3FZYN	1	0	The balls works just as described. Unfortunately my cat is too lazy to chase it. He doesn't even seem to be interested in eating the little treats that it leaves in a trail. It hasn't anything to do with the product itself, just my lazy cat (smile). I urge others to give this a try because it is a good product.
A1A2B4MPF3FZYN	1	1	This is one of the best products I have ever purchased. As a single woman, living alone with arthritic hands and wrists, opening a bottle of wine was always an ordeal. This product makes it as simple as pie. And it enables me to have that glass of wine with my meal and not have to waste the remainder since the vacuum pump makes it possible to keep the unused portion for later use. I highly recommend this item.
A1A2B4MPF3FZYN	1	1	I had the pleasure of living near this lovely Vermont village for several years. I love this book and still enjoy reading it from time to time. If you yearn for the simpler days of growing up in the 40's and 50's, this is the book for you!
A1A30BL7S8WBWF	0	0	I received my V-Moda Vibe Red Roxx earbuds the other day and opened them tonight. The red looked awesome, but as soon as I put them in my ears, even without yet plugging them into my mp3 player, I knew I was going to have problems.I struggled to get a good fit with the angle of my ear canals. They ended up sticking out. Worse, as soon as they were in, sound in my head amplified like my head was under water. Any wire movement produced a stethoscope effect in my ears. And I still hadn't plugged them in.Once plugged in and music on, the sound quality was quite good. I bought this pair for the bass because I have oversensitivity to high pitch noises and struggle to hear bass sounds, and I could actually hear bass for a change. And then I moved around.The wires moving in my hair alone interrupted the music. When the wires bumped my chest, a loud thump interjected the music including the highs that usually impede my ears above all other sounds. There is no way I'd be able to use these when jogging as I intended. The thumping and wire movement alongside music would drive me batty. And this is an original pair of new V-Moda earbuds, not an imitation.Back in the box these earbuds have gone. I'm only glad I already happened to be going to the mall an hour away tomorrow, because I need a refund from Best Buy. Back to the drawing board. Any earbuds that have a stethoscope effect won't get more than a two rating from me. But from reviews I've read, this may be a saving grace in the long run.
A1A30BL7S8WBWF	0	0	We own most of the Barbie movies and have watched them numerous times, but after this last movie, we won't buy anymore. Something's changed in management: animation is cheap with choppy movement, the character faces are different with wider eyes and rounder faces, not at all like Barbie doll faces, and worst, the characters act like brats. Barbie isn't Barbie at all. Neither is Ken. They act childish.Barbie starts a fight with a co-star after the co-star rips her dress, and Ken runs in anticipation to watch--disgusting. The Barbie girls have grown to know and love would never have picked a fight. She's wiser than that. And Ken would never have delighted in it. I hate that the storyline all revolves around guys, which is completely inappropriate for this target audience, and that the source of all the movie's problems is jealousy. Even in the end, the fairy princess, who by title should be a role model and therefore wise, acts like a brat, wanting to keep her former friends imprisoned for abandoning her friendship.Come on! This whole movie is shallow and a bad influence on young girls. It isn't even beneficial for teens, if they were to watch it. I had worried about a downward trend after A Fashion Fairytale's huge focus on glamour. Now I see I had good reason to worry. I wish I hadn't bought this worthless movie.From now on we're switching to the new Strawberry Shortcake. She's still nice, sweet, wise, and the stories have great problem-solving that has nothing to do with boy-girl relationships. At least one movie-doll star is still a good influence.
A1A30BL7S8WBWF	0	0	I bought this for a Christmas present for my husband, thinking my kids ages 7-18 would also enjoy a good shark movie. We couldn't scramble for the lost remote fast enough in Open Water (1) when a naked couple appeared on the screen for what seemed like forever before we finally turned off the TV, but not before seeing pubic hair. Nudity was not mentioned anywhere in this DVD's description, a serious infraction. I can't scrub those images from my kids' minds.The story was ok, albeit somewhat boring, until the end, which offered no satisfactory ending. I know this is a true story, but to be good, the couple's deaths should have been framed inside another person's story--coworkers, relatives, friends, etc,--to show how living people were impacted by their deaths and give the viewer some sort of payoff for watching.The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because I appreciated the effective clean camerawork and I didn't feel like I was watching a low budget film, and there are two movies on this disc for the price of one. I have not yet viewed Open Water 2, but even if fantastic, it would not up my rating of this movie set because of the significant problems with the first movie.
A1A3GQ2JMTMC3Y	1	1	The album is so full of details that you simply can't get tired listening to it. I've been listening to this album for sure once/two weeks for seven years and still like it. That's quite amazing. Greetings to all from Anders
A1A3GQ2JMTMC3Y	0	1	The 4 first parts of this live album is very good. There you can find a mix of the revolutions album. It's almost better than revoulutions itself. Otherwise it is not a very inspiring Live-CD.
A1A3PQXJ4KNVL4	0	0	A real Dud... the commentator gets on your nerve real fast... and only has about two minutes of real content. A missed opportunity to do a meaningful program.... don't approach getting your money worth on this effort.
A1A3PQXJ4KNVL4	0	0	I bought this thinking that M. Caine could do not wrong. I was wrong! The film is terrible. Nothing redeeming... the photography is bad - stilted [looks like home video], the dialogue is trite, the actor walk thru the parts and even St. Petersburg is not covered until the finishing credits... if you last that long.... really bad... save your money and if you want to see a good film of this genre buy The Ipcress File or any other M. Caine film....
A1A3PQXJ4KNVL4	0	0	So Bad... Bad science, bad video and waste of money. The same meaningless information over and over. How could they make this big a mess? Wish I had read the other reviews before I paid the twenty bucks. Not even decent filming.... pushed a very weak point way beyond the wall. What that other guy was doing in the film - don't know.. perhaps looking for work and still is.
A1A3PQXJ4KNVL4	0	0	Listen... no one likes his songs better than I and read his book which is also good... but not this album. The piano is too dominant.. and his vocals just can't come to the point. Pass on this if you want the music... if you want the mystique go for it but don't think he needs the money.
A1A3PQXJ4KNVL4	0	0	I was looking for an enlightened mind that could add new directions. I always believed you read to understand the world and most importantly yourself better. This didn't worked in this case, more withdrawn and isolated from those `people who watch NASCAR and support those I don't' ... but pay taxes and support his academic lifestyle. Sad. He should read more. Wish the title had been better served.
A1A3RAU47N5VWQ	0	1	The touchless operation of this trash can works great. Easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place. BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk.
A1A3RAU47N5VWQ	1	1	Had been looking for a train to put under our family Christmas tree. A couple of years ago I came across the Polar Express version when scoping the net for trains. Set was getting good reviews as seen on other sites. Amazon had the best price and no shipping cost... has been a great choice. The train set was a snap to put together. Great memories of the train under the tree in the 60's... but with NONE of the maintence problems of old time train and the track alignment problems!! Engine whistles and puffs smokes. Has been a hit with family and friends. Box the train came in is very well made and easy to repack for storage and protected from damage for next year. And of course as in movie, comes with the famous Gold Bell that rings when a child believes... to put on your own tree.
A1A3RAU47N5VWQ	0	0	If there was a no star rating, this massager would get it! I purchased this foot massager last year, after seeing it on Oprah Show. Picked by a guest actress, as a must have in her 9th month of pregnacy. Oh, so NOT what I hoped for. 1st, opening box to find NO moving message function was a negative. 2nd, in turning it on... was just a HIGH powered vibrating box. Had my mother-in-law use it for just afew minutes, thinking it would help with nerve/circulation problems(Dr had recommended a messager for this)and she had hard time walking the next day! She has since gotten a moving base model with better speed modes and has worked well for her. And 3rd, the high cost is a big waste... just go out and get a $20 massager for the same quality as this one.
A1A3RAU47N5VWQ	0	0	Purchased this for a Christmas gift just last year. And have already thrown it away. In putting it together it was not looking like it would hold up. And that it did not, the weight of albums bowed the bottom. And in moving it away from wall afew inches to clean behind, top broke off and split at sides!
A1A3RAU47N5VWQ	1	1	Have done pilates for years. Winsor is the best. There is a good selection of 1 hour workouts(or less)and the quick 20 minute ones... I have gotten down to 15 minutes in fast forwarding through her instruction of next move. Great, quick results of toning in doing everyday for 2-3 weeks and then 2-4 times aweek there after. And I do no other type of workout in between days. Enjoy!!
A1A3T0OTC2KYBO	0	0	There aren't many books that I slam shut halfway through and toss in the direction of the trash can. But I just couldn't stomach this one. Everyone from south of DC is portrayed as straight out of "Deliverance." The idea that some of them might be civilized, educated people who live in something other than shacks in swamps is inconceivable to the author. In fact pretty much all the characters are shallow stereotypes, and the plot did not interest me or ring true at all. And I work in DC and encounter clueless bureaucrats and inter-agency infighting daily. This book has zero basis in reality.Note to Lawson: yes, we say "y'all," on occasion, but it's SECOND PERSON *PLURAL*. "Y'all want some coffee?" MIGHT be said by a waitress to TWO guys sitting at a counter, but NOT one. Your bigotry and ignorance are astounding. Next time you want to set part of a book in a specific region of the country, you might actually try visiting it--and getting to know some of the locals--first. Sheesh.
A1A3T0OTC2KYBO	1	1	I originally bought this from the iTunes store, which means it won't play in Windows Media Player. Sadly, it's not available as an MP3. I bought the whole CD just for "Night on the Lake," which I've been unable to find a match for in the nature sound MP3s. It's the perfect combination of insects, frogs and the occasional splash reminding you you're by the water. Can't say much for the other tracks--"Summer Ambience" is good, but "Costa Rican Birds" quickly gets annoying. On the whole, if you're looking to be transported away from city noise, this is the way to go.
A1A3WWUOU4MRB9	1	1	UPDATE 8/23/12: Trudeau contacted me based on my review & pictures here and sent me a new one. Excellent customer service, way to stand behind your product! I've changed my rating from 3 to 4. If, by some miracle, the handles no longer fill with water in the dishwasher I'll up it to 5.I'm on my fourth or fifth garlic press, all having either broken or presented some major design flaw.The Trudeau Garlic Press does a great job of mincing garlic and the cleaning mechanism works very well.Unfortunately it's hollow and unsealed and fills with dirty water in the dishwasher. A poor feature in a "dishwasher safe" product!If you intend to hand wash your press then this is a great choice. If not, you may want to keep looking.Update 1/1/12:It served me well for four years but last night snapped trying to mince a clove of garlic. See pics.
A1A3WWUOU4MRB9	1	1	Anyone with pets or kids should have a jug of this around. In addition to spot cleanups I use it in the carpet shampooer (I have the Bissel Pro-Heat and SpotBot). It doesn't make suds and you don't need to rinse it completely--in fact it's probably better not to so you leave the enzymes behind to keep working.
A1A3WWUOU4MRB9	1	1	One of the few cookbooks that warrants a coveted spot on the kitchen shelf as opposed to being relegated to the bookcase in the spare room with the other infrequently used cookbooks.My copy falls open to the mile-high lemon meringue pie, and I bet yours will too.
A1A3WWUOU4MRB9	0	1	The locking mechanisms are flimsy.The handle dips deep into the cake space so a two layer cake (even a thin one) won't fit. It's fine for a single layer.The bottom has cracked diagonally through the center.
A1A4AX0YG1TPE2	1	1	I've used this product in the past and my body has gotten accustomed to it. The product has been reformulated and it's working for me again. I get a nice clean energy boost with no jitters, I'm able to sleep at night, and now the product can be taken on an empty stomach. This product delivers on it's claims.
A1A4AX0YG1TPE2	1	1	I have a Moka Express pot that was my great grandmother's from about 50 years ago and decided to try to use it. The gasket and filter were corroded and falling apart. I found this replacement set and took a chance and ordered it. The gaskets and filter are original-equipment quality and fit perfectly.
A1A4AX0YG1TPE2	1	1	I have had this watch for about two years. It just runs great and it looks even better. The crystal is very sturdy and does not scratch.The description is incorrect - the bezel does move and is bi-directional and slide rule. My only advice is that if you sweat alot, be prepared to replace the band. I was able to find a replacement band without too much trouble at one of those watch kiosks in a mall.You will not be disappointed by this watch!
A1A4FSFJ5DRXLV	1	1	I loved this book! It was enthralling and hard to put down. Even after finishing it, I went back and re-read bits and pieces of it. The prose is wonderful, not overly verbose or trying to be overly descriptive. The agony that Abby feels is very real; I felt for the characters, could understand what they were doing and why. It was a very true book - it has a "based on a true story" feel to it with names of neighborhoods, stores, new stores that open up [that are all real]. Such a story could be real; we know it is real for someone, many out there who suffer this kind of loss. A very well-written book.
A1A4FSFJ5DRXLV	0	0	I just finished this book. While the premise was strong, the book was too slow-paced. Paul could have done so much more with almost everything. The character sketches were weak. The reader wasn't allowed to get close to anyone. Everyone was distant, almost a fictional figure rather than appearing real and popping out of the pages. There could have been a couple of characters with their own intimate story weaving a thread through the main distant story, that helped the story move along. Some of the events were true in history, but none of the incidents in the book seemed imminent or made the pages turn. I couldn't understand how a single lone pilot, and such a young and inexperienced one at that, had command of the island and wasn't overpowered by the locals. To add more sympathy to him, there could have been more detail added to his background - perhaps more to the story with the fishmonger's daughter.This was not worth a read at all. I had to finish it because of my book-club, but we had a unanimous verdict on the book.
A1A4IGZE9X1VP1	1	1	Great little headphones. They are simple and easy to use. They are good quality for 12 dollars . I have prime so it shipped for free. Do not buy these if you want to listen to music. I bought it for watching youtube video and not disturbing my gf when she is sleeping.
A1A4IGZE9X1VP1	1	1	This is good oil. It will not do magic for your car, but will give you all the protection for normal driving. I use synthetics and do 5k oil changes to avoid any engine trouble.
A1A4IGZE9X1VP1	0	1	This was the wrong belt for 2005 prius. Use 2004 or 2006 to get the right belt. I would also suggest to check bando website before you order it
A1A4IZ3FGXB3L1	0	1	I don't know who Amazon is playing with but it won't be me and my money. Received a full on bootlegged copy top to boot with misspellings of all kinds, to horrible quality and just down right noticeable. Tell me if this is correct:Cruella. De. Vle.No? Oh I was pretty sure her name was DE VIL not DUH-VLUH!I will wait when the Blu Ray Diamond Edition is released but until then. I rate this 1 star!By the way. If you DO have a non bootlegged copy (where there is no misspellings, good quality, and on the back of the disc on the rim NOT saying 101 Dalmatians-cause that's a sign of bootleggery cause Disney will never label their disks on the back with the actual name of the product). Then please rate this a five star with a quick review. This WILL counter my review. But as I say...until then. The people who are behind this...I wish to hurt...badly. Not cool.
A1A4USK7S1HEAA	0	0	This thing worked great, exactly as advertised. But it only did it twice. Then the non-stick coating on the egg-poaching cup started to peel off. "Oh, that's not a big deal," you say. Well, it's actually a rather big deal indeed. The teflon stuff doesn't just peel off all at once, and you can't just scrape off the "iffy" part and then be done with it. No, every time you make eggs, from now until eternity, little chunks of teflon will come off and attach themselves to your otherwise-perfect egg.This is a very serious design flaw. I tried a workaround (putting in a piece of foil in the cup) but it doesn't work (the eggs don't cook through, if you're wondering, and there's no way to adjust for it).I'm going to call the company and see if they have functional replacements. I note that a number of other reviews have complained about this problem -- perhaps they've taken notice. If so, I'll gladly come back and give this thing the rating it would otherwise deserve.
A1A4USK7S1HEAA	0	0	I bought this because I quite liked their first album and was hoping for more of the same. My hopes are now dashed. The only elaboration I can offer is that it's intensely boring and the lead singer's voice is somehow far more irritating on this album than it was on hot fuss.In the interest of full disclosure, I probably wouldn't have bothered to write this review if it weren't for their inane comments about green day's "american idiot." I had already concluded this new album is bad before then, but probably would have kept it to myself. I award it two stars instead of one because I feel guilty about the conflict of interest.[after giving it one more try, i came back to try to take back the second star (but amazon won't let me). this album is just too awful for words. i guess if you like/can stand it, more power to you.]
A1A4W0CDDBKQKE	1	1	This book is written in a way in which it explains frequent real world issues and uses good analogies to help the reader 'get it' and avoid project pitfalls. Helps programmers think about the business side of programming and helps managers see some of the problems developers experience.
A1A4W0CDDBKQKE	1	1	This has everything you'll need to program in C++ from beginner through expert. If I had to take my C/C++ class over again, I would ask the prof if we could use this book.
A1A4W0CDDBKQKE	1	1	I purchased this model almost 5 years ago. I am still on the same 9v battery despite leaving it on a couple of times for awhile by accident. I have used it on everything from checking batteries for the kids' toys to electrical work around the house. This is a very versatile checker and has a high max AC and DC load for the price (more than some twice the price). My home is older and I've done a lot of electrical work with it including adding breakers to the main electrical panel and working with the fuse box (I have both in my house). The instructions are a bit lacking but since my father was a line man and electrical contractor growing up we always had something like this around the house, so I know how to use it (plus I paid attention in science class and didn't go to school in Kansas ;) I am just now looking for a replacement lead because the insulation cracked on the black one, but that's my own fault for inappropriately storing it while wrapping the wires around the device instead of unplugging them from the device :( I was about to by another one, but then i found the replacement part for about $5.
A1A540GMC2O86	1	1	Although the sound quality was uneven, the doco was very interesting to see the original film chronicling the progress of this nuclear testing which took place in 1954 at the "Pacific Proving Grounds".
A1A540GMC2O86	1	1	"The Empire Strikes Back" is an essential purchase for any fan of the original "Star Wars" trilogy. I strongly recommend getting "A New Hope" (Star Wars Episode 4) as well as "Return of the Jedi" (Episode 6)too. The "pan and scan" (1:33) aspect ratio is perfect for 4:3 television sets.
A1A5JDL4T8LFS8	1	1	OK, I'm a bit retarded. I'm a writer (mostly ghostwriting, mostly medical/health related), and I constantly refer to The Chicago Manual of Style and various other references. And although I had heard of "Strunk and White" for decades, I had never seen it until a few months ago. What an incredible resource! It's quite short, and tells us almost everything we need to know in order to write proper English. As soon as I had spent just ten minutes browsing through The Elements of Style, I logged onto Amazon and bought a copy for each of my five grown children (most are university students). The book asks the questions we all want to ask, and gives very clear examples of correct punctuation, grammar, etc. It's no doubt the best reference you'll ever see on English writing style. Don't write home without it.
A1A5JDL4T8LFS8	1	1	I first heard this music decades ago when I worked as an announcer for WRR-FM, the classical station in Dallas. It's thrilling. Fox was a showman; and for this audience, that was particularly appropriate. At one point the crowd goes wild, clapping riotously to a fugue that in most other contexts the audience would listen to in sober, quiet "sophistication." I was grateful to Fox for reaching beyond stuffiness to bring Bach to a venue that was home to a lot of other great music, but not "classical" music. I'd love to own this album--if only I could afford it!
A1A5JDL4T8LFS8	0	1	It will be difficult to write this review without including a spoiler, but I'll do my best.Let me begin by referring to Mozart. Although one of the two or three greatest composers in the history of western music, Mozart was in no way an innovator. He worked entirely within existing forms. Yes, he took those forms to glorious new heights never before achieved, and he pushed at the edges on many occasions, but he never (or at least rarely) went a great distance beyond the boundaries of the forms extant in his day as he created masterpiece after masterpiece.I have limited my reading of fiction for several years to mysteries written by women, with female protagonists. I find such writings (on average) more interesting, less contaminated with testosterone-fed silliness, than the average mystery written by a male. And in Susan Sloan I felt I had found a new, higher standard of writing. An Isolated Incident was the first of her books I happened to pick up. The writing was superb, the characters complex and well-drawn and mostly quite likable, the suspense agonizing. I lost sleep for several nights, staying up much later than I should have stayed up, eager to see what would happen next. She was the best writer I had read in a several years (and I was reading a book every few nights). Finally, I stayed up VERY late in order to finish the book. And I was devastated.When I am looking for a mystery novel, whether at the local library or at a book store, I find it in a special section devoted to mystery novels. These books are NOT in the general fiction category, where one finds more "serious fiction." People typically read mysteries for escape. When I want "serious fection," I search in a different section of the library or bookstore. Most of us expect writers of mysteries to follow certain conventions, just as people listening to a classical concerto, whether by Mozart or Haydn or anyone else, expect the music to remain within certain boundaries. If a Mozart piano concerto were to have a final rondo that at the end sounded more like Stravinski than like a classical concerto, I would be shocked and outraged (even though I love Stravinski).I hope the parallel is clear. I was shocked and outraged by the "last movement" of this novel, even though the author signaled the ending (in part!) long before the final pages, and the question of "whodunnit" in the end was no surprise to me. But the final disposition of characters and of plot were beyond the pale of mystery writing, in my (obviously highly biased) opinion. I'm being vague in order to keep this review from containing a "spoiler." But I will say that I was so disillusioned after finishing this book--a book that earlier had excited me because I thought I had found the best mystery writer I had read in ages--that I have essentially lost interest in reading mysteries, after having read hundreds of them over the past ten years or so.Ms. Sloan need not have strayed so far outside the bounds of conventional mysteries. She's such a good writer that she could have written a GREAT mystery with a more conventional ending, just as Mozart wrote great music without ever wandering outside the forms handed to him by his predecessors. I can only hypothesize that she decided to attempt a more "literary" ending, one more typical of "serious fiction," because she felt that a conventional ending was too mundane. I only wish she had the sensibility of a Mozart, realizing that, with her talent, she could have remained firmly within the bounds of conventional endings and still have written a masterpiece of the mystery genre. Unfortunately, she wrote a book that is 90% masterpiece with an ending that is so jarring that I have actually been disillusioned with mysteries altogether. I've for the most part gone back to histories and biographies.
A1A5JDL4T8LFS8	0	0	The product didn't work from the beginning. When I tried to pump it, the top came up but the cylinder that was supposed to do the pumping slipped out of the top and remained stuck to the sprayer. I worked and worked with it and eventually gave up. I desperately needed a sprayer several days later, and ended up going to a local department store where I discovered the only available mister was the exact same brand! I bought one anyway, and found to my relief that it worked quite well. Guess the one I ordered online was just a lemon. I didn't bother to try to send the device back to the vendor, because I'm quite busy and it just wasn't worth the effort.So I guess it may be somewhat unfair to give the product only one star, since the identical product I purchased at a local store works fine. I'll retain the one-star rating, however, since this PARTICULAR product from this vendor was completely worthless. In sum: I have purchased two MISTO sprayers, with one working fine and one not working at all. You can arrive at your own conclusion about how to interpret these data.

A1A5TS9R18R73Y	1	1	Product was received within a few days. The PLP-1 Freezer Pop Maker is very well made and I'm sure will last many years. The molded plastic is not flimsy and has metal at the top, as well as a metal lid. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with 2 25-piece packs of popsicle sticks, which I must have overlooked when ordering. I do highly recommend this product.As for making real nutritious pops, I searched the internet only to find sugar-laden recipes full of ingredients I just didn't want in my pops. Here's my recipe for a simple & delicious treat: Place 1.5 cups each of strawberries & blueberries in the blender. Add the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Add 1 cup water and blend. Add additional water slowly between blending until you bring the mixture to about 3 cups. Taste for sweetness. If the berries were sweet you won't need to use sugar. If not, add 2 tablespoons of sugar to this mixture and do a final blend. Makes enough to fill your popsicle maker. Allow to freeze 6-8 hours, depending on your freezer setting. Enjoy!You can use this process with any fruit mixture. Experiment with Kiwi/Banana, Strawberry/Banana, Raspberry/Coconut, Cantaloupe, Watermelon/Blueberry, Orange/Yogurt. If you like, you can add a little French Vanilla Ice Cream to fruit also.Stay cool!
A1A5TS9R18R73Y	1	1	I've been using this product for years, as prescribed by a naturopathic physician, and it gets my highest recommendation. The product tonifies and sweeps out your colon, removing accumulated debris & sludge.It takes a few tries to get your mixing technique just right - Most effective for me has been to put 1/2" of water in a large glass, add the Sonne and start stirring briskly as you add in the rest of the (cold or room temperature) water all at once. I like to take this product with just water but you can flavor it with a little juice, if you wish. Stir, stir, stir and drink it quickly or it will gel. You should follow Sonne with a full glass of water. What you are literally doing is filling your entire colon with Psyllium fiber to sweep it out.It's best to cleanse periodically (every 3-6 months) for seven (7) days to eliminate problems with gas, bloating, sour stomach, etc., which are indicative of a sluggish colon. Take the Sonne 1st thing in the morning upon rising and last thing at night before retiring. Depending on how sluggish your system is, you will start producing large bowel movements (don't worry - it's all that great Psyllium) within 1-3 days. Don't be surprised to see "ropey strands" in your movements (epecially if you eat a lot of red meat) - That is the debris coming out of your system.Well, I won't go into any more details and invite you to experience wellness for yourself. Believe it or not, your gut is the center of your immune system and where all your nutrition is absorbed. It can't do its job if it's dirty. An indication of this is that you didn't use the bathroom today. You should use the bathroom every day, once or twice a day, depending on what you eat. Mornings, about 1 hour following waking, the body automatically begins the elimination process. Please don't overlook this important step in your wellness regimen - Your vitamins will absorb better, you'll be more alert & energized, your skin & eyes will be clearer, your breath will improve, you'll lose that overextended gut, and (most importantly) ward off future colon issues caused by a lack of fiber intake.All the very best to you - Here's to good health!
A1A5TS9R18R73Y	0	0	I have been utilizing organic psyllium for years, as part of my overall health & wellness regimen. My favorite and (hands-down) most effective brand is Sonne Intestinal Cleanser, which was initially prescribed to me by a naturopathic physician. Sonne keeps well - You keep in the in cupboard, use as needed, and no matter how much time passes, it's as effective and as fresh as the day you opened that jar.This product, on the other hand, was nowhere near as effective, so I ended up using it less. Recently, while feeling a cold coming on, I decided to do a clease. This product had been in the cupboard, tightly sealed for about three months. When I opened the jar, you can imagine my surprise to find hundreds of 1/2" - 1" grubs feeding off the product. I thought this product was supposed to be organic - It's not - There had to have been grub eggs in there for larvae to develop over such a short period of time.I do not recommend this product - It is ineffective, not a good quality item, and may do you more harm than good. Please don't put this stuff in your system.Stay well!
A1A5V6KCL1T456	0	0	Junk. The first unit lasted 14 months. Still under warrenty so I purchased another unit as a spare until first one could be repaired and it leaked out of the box. Am going with Instant hot by Kitchenmade as that unit lasted 8 years.
A1A5V6KCL1T456	1	1	This is by far the most awesome kitchen appliance I have purchased. It seems to cook everything I throw into it flawlessly. I have tried white, brown, wild and boxed (rice-o-roni type) and they all turn out perfect. My wife has made cakes with this unit and it comes out well also. I use it for making gravy during the holidays, soups, spaghetti and meatball etc. this list is too numerous to keep going on. Bravo Panasonic!
A1A5V6KCL1T456	0	0	I purchased this unit from a big box retailer in Nov. of 2007 for $220 and, while the service has been acceptable it has become necessary to replace some leaky parts. At first I said to myself, "Self, this is a clever design" The hose and spray assembly was modular such that they could be replaced in a 'plug and play' fashion. I was stunned to find that the retail price to do so would have set me back $180.00!! Clever indeed!Research on the net has got the price down to $135. but that's still too high in my opinion. As an engineer, I am capable of rebuilding the unit and that's what I'll be doing (parts are about $40.00) but offer fair warning to those who are not as mechanically inclined. As such, I'll be purchasing something different next time.
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	0	0	This vacuum is impressive looking, I'll give it that. Sadly, that's the only nice thing I can say about it. It's heavy, clunky, constantly loses suction and the accessories fall off while you use it. Probably due to it's "electro-static" feature, the thing is a dust magnet...you can clean it thoroughly, place it in a clean spot, and the following day the entire machine is evenly coated with dust. Worst of all, it frequently decides to spray dirt and dust all over the place, creaing a FAR bigger mess than the one you're attempting to clean up!I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Or negative stars, seeing as how it's better suited to creating messes than cleaning them. Whomever designed this steaming pile should be fired. Or imprisoned.I just bought a Dyson DC25. It's expensive, but works like a dream. If you want my Eureka, it will be sitting out at the curb next Thursday morning!
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	0	1	EDIT: Okay, after a few more weeks of daily use, the shedding has almost entirely stopped. It lost one bristle this morning, but I had several "shed free" days in a row. The brush truly does work very well, a world of difference from the boar brush I previously used. At this price point, I must admit that it's an excellent value. I'd bump this review up a star, if I could.------This brush is reasonably soft, holds water well, and generates great lather. However, each time I use it, 8-10 bristles get deposited on my face! They clog the razor, and I'm constantly picking them off my face and sink. I'd hoped it would be fine after all the loose hairs fell out, but I've been using it daily for two weeks now, and the shedding gets a little worse each day.If something seems unusually inexpensive, it's usually for a reason. I'm shopping for a new brush, and I won't go cheap this time.
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	1	1	This stuff works very well, I actually prefer it to some soaps that cost six times the price. Great volumes of slippery lather, and a nice subtle scent. I'm not ordinarily a fan of bay rum, as it's generally too strong and sickly sweet, but at this low concentration it's very nice and has really grown on me. The scent does not linger, so it won't interfere with your aftershave or cologne.You can certainly use it right out of the simple package, although it may not be something you want to leave out on the counter. I pop the puck into an small, inexpensive bowl (from the local Chinese market!)and heat it in the microwave for about 15 seconds. It quickly melts into the form of the bowl, and cools right back down in a few minutes.
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	1	1	While this product is intended for use with RVs, I use it as an inexpensive and convenient way to filter tap water for homebrewing beer. I simply thread it onto a white, drinking water hose (also an RV product)and direct the flow into my hot liquor tank. The filtered water tastes very pure and clean, with no hint of chlorine.I find this product to be very economical and convenient, and a lot simpler than other filtering solutions. After use, I simply drain the excess water, place it in a ziplock bag and stow it in the fridge until my next brewing session.
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	1	1	I've been using one of these about twice a week for the past few years, and just bought another for my vacation home. They work just great, it's hard to imagine why the people giving negative reviews are struggling so much. Like any microwave cooking product, it takes some experimenting to dial in the exact cooking time and procedure that works for you. You can't expect the manufacturer to guess how powerful your microwave is, the size and temperature of your eggs and to what stage of doneness you want them cooked! For me, 55 seconds on high followed by another 20 seconds of rest gives me two beautifully cooked eggs, with solid whites and soft yolks. This is for eggs from the fridge, if I've brought them straight from the coop (That's right, no store-bought eggs for me!) I shave about 10 seconds off the time. Again, expect to do a little bit of testing to figure out what works for you.I've NEVER had the poacher pop open in the microwave and make a mess, just remember to poke a few slits in each yolk...the round bottom will still keep the yolk centered. I've also never had a hinge break, after hundreds of uses. Finally, for those of you complaining that the "cooked eggs have round bottoms and won't sit on a muffin," just turn the damn egg over so the perfectly flat top becomes the bottom!!
A1A5ZWV0Z3G4H8	0	0	Folks, you've got to be REALLY hungry if you think these things are a good snack. Having read several reviews, I expected them to be salty...but holy cow, they are like chewing on rock salt. I ate about five of them and the rest of the bag went into the trash. They also leave your teeth feeling strange, unclean and "squeaky," I couldn't brush my teeth fast enough after eating them. I was going to buy a case here on Amazon, but I'm SO GLAD I bought a single bag (white cheddar) locally to try them out.Save your money and save your blood pressure!!
A1A67OC0M5TKON	0	0	Hawking is almost as bad a company as Best Buy. That is really saying something. This was the second of 3 items that Hawking told me I would need, after the fact. I have bought all 3 because I have a tiger by the tail and can't let go. I am still not up and running.THIS ANTENNA IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD!!
A1A67OC0M5TKON	1	1	I used to use Lexol on my baseball glove when I was a kid. That was 52 years ago. For the last 35 years I have used Hide Food by Connolly on my auto interiors and leather furniture. Hide Food is very expensive and hard to work with. I just tried Lexol on my car's interior and I could not be happier. It is cheap, really easy to use and the leather looks great. I used a very small foam rubber sponge, which minimized waste and it worked quickly and easily. No more expensive Hide Food for me.
A1A67OC0M5TKON	1	1	I have not bought a CD for about the last 5 years. There is no longer a reason to do so. That being said, the music on this is really good. Old fashioned, great jazz.
A1A67OC0M5TKON	1	1	This thermos keeps my coffee hot for 12 hours and I wopn't drink coffee that isn't hot. Screw sales tax. Next time I will find a place to buy elsewhere.
A1A6AODFJ81WWX	1	1	Since I don't live anymore in the US I try to keep up with good TV series by buying DVD (via amazon.com). I knew nothing about "Deadwood" until I read an article about censorship and TV in America today in the New York Times (that was about two months ago). "Deadwood" was offered as an example of a program that would be more and more difficult to be produced despite its quality, because of a new push of a moral (moron) majority (I dare say "majority") to suppress whatever it's not considered appropriate for their taste.Anyway, not to get sidetracked here, I bought it out of curiosity. Personally I don't care too much about westerns. I mean, I like them all right, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch them on TV or in a theater. So I was very reluctant before watching "Deadwood".Well, in my opinion, "Deadwood" may very well be the best kept secret in American TV right now (many of my American friends have not watched it on TV). Of course it shouldn't be such a big surprise. It's an HBO production, which is a good start, and then it's David Milch. The man has done NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blue (among other things).This is no ordinary John Wayne-western. It's real, it's dirty, it's not necessarily happy-ending. But it's great. The good guys, the bad guys, the rivalries, the friendships, the dialogues. Man, the dialogues. When you do buy the DVDs take the time to listen to Milch's interview about the language used in this series and how they went about making sure that along the clothes and the buildings and the customs the cared enough to make sure that the language is real. On top of listening to some very interesting information you will get to understand the kind of energy and talent is involved in this."Deadwood" is fantastic. It's good TV. No, it's not just good, it's superb. After a while you feel like you have something invested in this community of bandits who's trying to make a future back then in the "wild-west". Anyway, not to get overly sentimental here you will enjoy every episode and you will be looking forward for season two. It's worth every penny you will spend on it and more.
A1A6AODFJ81WWX	1	1	It's not only that "The Wire" is great TV. It's that season two doesn't let you down. Take for example "24 Hours". I saw season one, practically straight through, five hours at the time. It was quick, it was intense, it was original. Season two was not fresh. The same issues seem to appear again. I am ready for any leap of faith, the guy shoots from 50 meters, kills three people, but please, please give me a plot that I can believe in.But back to "The Wire".I went to the series after suffering withdrawal symptoms finishing "Sopranos", "Deadwood", "NYPD Blue" (these guys stopped at season two and never cared to proceed) and "The Shield". I went through season one and thanked God for having enough faith on HBO to buy two seasons of the show together. I am half-way through finishing season two and I am already convinced that this is not going to let me down. Once again, I enjoy TV with a plot thick enough to get me interested but not to get lost. I like characters that have something different, but no so much that I find them odd. I enjoy a story with a moral center, but not a morality lesson.Season one was centered in a Baltimore "ghetto". Season two expands into the Baltimore port. There are new characters added to the old ones, and yet you get comfortable with the new plot almost immediately. The production has spend money for the extra shot in an outside location in the middle of the night, just have two characters saying two lines, just to shed a light into what the characters think. It's the attention to detail that makes a good show great. And it's the superb casting, and the talent of writing.As a consumer many times I felt cheated off my money after buying a product that turned out to be less than what it promised. In the case of "The Wire", as with "Deadwood" (HBO) the "The Sopranos" (HBO) and "The Shield" (Fox) I feel that I would have happily paid more. If you haven't bought season 1, go ahead buy season 1 and 2 together. You would wish that there was season 3 out there.
A1A6AODFJ81WWX	0	0	[NO spoilers]I have to say I watched season one, six hours at a time. I probably didn't sleep a couple of nights staying until the morning. The idea was brilliant, one hour, real-time, multiple screens, multiple plots converging. OK, that daughter of Bauer wouldn't just stay put as her father said, but what can you do ...The ending also was different than the obvious, and I appreciated the effort to suprise the viewer.Season two didn't seem right. The plot seemed weak, but something from season one propelled me ahead. I do have to tell you though that I am watching season three out of misplaced sense of ... duty to finish it up. (In between I watched two superb seasons of "The Wire" (HBO), and season 3 of "The Shield" (FOX), excellent as well. I am half way through, so unless something spectacular about the show happens, I must say I am very disappointed. Unfortunately I cannot see how ...In it's not so much about the plot and the sudden turns. That also becomes somehow predictable. The secret, I think, a good story depends a lot on the capacity contain enough true elements that we can relate to, so that the "unreal" ones become possible. Not the case here. So may things seem impossible. For example the decision-making in the White House. We read newspapers, we watch the news, we even watch other movies to have a general sense on how a Presidency works, and how it couldn't. I have no problem having a President developing an unprecedented relationship to an agent so that they are calling each other on the phone more than I call my best friends, but there is no way on earth that decisions on serious matters like - I am using an unrelated example to the story - a hijacking of a plane that include foreign dignitaries held for ransom money is decided between a President, his brother and his ex-wife (who mind you repeatedly and over and again convinced us that is worthy of no trust). As you watch the movie you go "come on..." way too often. And that's just one example of many.The characters are thin. They exhibit no real emotion. Death, sickness, loss, threat, sacrifice, heroism, treason, all exist, but there is nothing under the surface.I was a big fan of `24' in the beginning, but if you haven't bought any of the series, I would say go and buy season one and leave it there. It was a stroke of brilliance that was followed by mediocrity, despite all efforts.
A1A6BXW7KVHQQE	1	1	like it says... forget any social life or sleeping ever again. your muscles will cramp up, you will become irate and smelly. even if you can pry yourself away from the computer you will find any excuse to come back and check on your animals. You may originally buy this for your kids but they will be eating cold cereal for dinner while you obsess over the polar bear to zookeeper ratio and what kind of trees the giraffes would like in their exhibit and how to keep down the tiger population....it is soothing to build aquarium tanks with corals and sea-grasses for stingrays,sea turtles, baby whales :) and dolphin shows, and the dinosaur tycoon has T-rex, bigfoots, Nessies and abominable snowmen! my son likes to set the dinosaurs free &let them eat everyone, but then zoo attendance drops and he runs out of money, go figure. You can also drop the "zoo guests" into the shark tanks if they complain too much.
A1A6BXW7KVHQQE	0	1	honestly people, this is like making fun of Barney. Who cares? I winced when I added Kidz Bop 4 to my shopping cart but that is what my nephew wants for Christmas (...not MY kids and NOT in MY house ! ). I would rather have bought him KidzBop Gold, at least he could have learned the words to The 59th Street Bridge Song and Here Comes the Sun instead of Complicated or My Boo, some of the songs they have to censor but the subject matter is the same and its just wrong... Did they make kids' versions of Stones and Zeppelin songs? ...that would have been cute...or Romeo Void or Van Halen? kiddy porn. But anyway I think KIdzBop Gold is the best one, if you can call it that...

A1A6ETNNUSULP4	1	1	This is absolutely one of the books that should be proudly displayed on everyone researcher's bookshelf: it details a usable theory of data graphics, provides an excellent rogue's gallery of misleading figures, and is the kind of well-designed book that we need to see more of.The only thing I can find about this to complain about is the fact that the majority of what Tufte presents as new and better methods for presenting or refining old styles of plots CANNOT be found in modern graphing packages.In truth, this is wholly an excellent book for anyone that has to deal with graphs. If you have ever been interested in a graph, or have ever been fascinated by data, get a copy of this book. It won't disappoint.
A1A6ETNNUSULP4	1	1	This is a series that was far ahead of its time. If it were on today, this would be a headliner on Cartoon Swim. It is full of good-natured violence, ridiculous fast-paced prose, zany antics, and detailed artwork that makes it stand out from the crowd. I love cartoons, but there are few that hold up as well as this does. Strongly recommended.
A1A6ETNNUSULP4	0	1	Season One of Jericho was a wonder, full of human-interest, high tension, good writing, and a touch of conspiracy. Season Two failed to measure up, right from the start. Many characters from the first season are missing, and the show has a much stronger sense of claustrophobia, rather than the expansive solitude of the first. To make matters worse, the writers seem to fall into the "didn't have a plan" trap that plagues so many of this style of show.This is worth watching as closure for fans of Season One, but only just barely.
A1A6ETNNUSULP4	1	1	This is without a doubt the best new series since Mad Men. Each episode is a movie of its own, beautifully shot, cleverly written, wonderfully executed. The only complaint possible to level against this one is that there is not nearly enough of it. I cannot wait for more.
A1A6IXOSULKVEY	0	0	Worked fine, until I needed to feed from the ADF-Jammed every time, could not get to work. Then 35 days after I bought it, and put in a new black ink, said all 3 colors were missing or bad. After three online chats with mostly incompetent HP techs, I have to return it, pay 79.99 for a 3 year warranty, so I can avoid an overnight charge.. Not that any technology item works perfectly, but you would think a product work work perfectly out of the box for at least awhile. And the cost of the #88 ink, well we won't go there....Update: After getting replacement printer-Discovered that the only problem was-the printer was out of ink-yes, just out of ink. Strange that three tech support people could not detect that, along with the warning not saying it was out of ink, but missing ink...
A1A6IXOSULKVEY	0	1	Plugged in fine. That's about it. It played one dvd, and from then on, would not play anymore. I put brand new dvds into it, that worked fine on my other dvd player, but it would keep saying LOADING LOADING LOADING....

A1A6R8WBZGXFNL	0	1	I have been using a French Press for years and when I saw this I thought it would be nice to be able to keep the coffee warm for longer periods of time. It does do that well, but when pushing down the plunger, it almost always forces grounds past the filter screen as well as air which often, even when used very cautiously, comes bubbling out of the spout (Yes, even when it is not totally filled). So if you don't mind cleaning, and you are not apposed to swallowing some grounds, this is the product for you. I occasionally use it to keep coffee warm that I make in my glass French Press, since this does a very nice job of maintaining the heat.
A1A6R8WBZGXFNL	1	1	This product is exactly as described. The price is very good, and I can only presume it is partially due to the no frills packaging that it comes in. I for one, do not appreciate all of these fancy boxes that items like this tend to come in. For me it is a waist of space, I already have storage cabinets and drawers dedicated to storage, so if I can save a couple of dollars by not paying for fancier packaging, which I won't use, and will ultimately be stored some place out of the way until I go on a cleaning bing, then that is the best choice for me.
A1A6R8WBZGXFNL	0	0	Misleading Advertisement:I will start by saying that this product is very good, which is why I am shopping for it. I spotted that it was available through Amazon and found most were selling the 1.75 oz box which has 5 bags x .35 oz. The problem here is that this vendor is selling the 1.75 oz box and showing the 3.5 oz which has 10 bags x .35oz per box, instead. The picture is what brought me to this seller since I knew what I am looking for. People that are unfamiliar with the product sizes can be easily fooled by this type of deceptive advertising. It is my hope that they read this before committing to the purchase.
A1A6R8WBZGXFNL	0	0	The description says that this item is 1.08 inches x 1.50 inches x 36 inches. In another area of the listing it says 1.1 x 1.5 x 36 inches. When they arrived I didn't even open them, and could not believe what size they really are. I measured them with calipers through the plastic bag they came in and found that they are .49" x .51" and didn't bother to measure the length since they were so drastically different from what was posted and also from what I needed for my job that it didn't matter. Now the job I had scheduled for Saturday is postponed until the Panduit Pan-Way LD-10's arrive. This has been a disappointing waist of my time and an inconvenience to my customer which could have been avoided with proper and accurate description of this product
A1A6YQERCZK7XL	1	1	Nathan Zuckerman is an Everyman with Everyman's problems. Never mind that he is suddenly famous. Never mind that he is the author of a perverse volume known as Carnovsky (presumably similar to Roth's own Portnoy's Complaint). Never mind that he is psychologically oppressed by his Jewish parents and upbringing. These are all just fodder for his overactive mind to react to, trip over, and take refuge from. He could have been anybody. Roth's portrayal of Zuckerman is so accessible and so real that you understand him completely despite his unusual circumstances. The balance of sympathy, pathos, and humor lead you to never doubt that this is a basically good man suddenly overwhelmed by life. You may not agree with his actions, but you can't be certain that you would have reacted any differently. This novel is brisk, funny, enlightening, and moving. Thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining.
A1A6YQERCZK7XL	0	0	This is the most disappointing CD I've purchased in a very long time. Initially skeptical, after I heard and liked 3 different tunes on the radio, I decided to give it a chance. Unfortunately, the rest of the disc pales in comparison. Quite frankly, parts of this CD are so bad, it goes so far as to diminish the songs I used to like in the first place. The problem? First of all, the majority of songs here are highly unoriginal. Most of them are so derivative you can easily identify the artist who's being [imitated]. And by comparison, the Limp Bizkit tunes sound like a total rip-off. And like most rip-offs, they are inferior. That's the second problem: so many of these songs are simply bad. Unimaginative, uninspired, pillars of mediocrity. The textures, the dynamics, the lyrics, the structure: all of it bland and predictable. There is nothing here that might suggest it would grow on me after a few more listens. On the contrary, there is plenty here to discourage that. Which brings me to the third, and most serious problem: the band comes across as embarrassingly immature. In both ability and sensibility, they show an unmistakable lack of depth. No amount of profanity or attitude can obscure this fact. And the worst part about it is that they are so arrogant. On almost every track they sing their own praises, as if they have to tell you how good they are to make up for their lack of talent. It's actually kind of pitiful.That being said, there are a handful of likable, if not particularly good, songs here. But if it's music you're interested in, I wouldn't buy this disc. If you're more interested in image, then this is probably a good choice. Because ultimately this disc comes across as an unsubstantial marketing vehicle aimed at young kids who want more badly to be cool than real.
A1A6YQERCZK7XL	1	1	When reviewing a CD, it's difficult sometimes to balance its immediate appeal with its lasting appeal. Unlike a book, a good CD must be listened to over and over, and must not grow stale. Trying to judge the quality of a recently released recording without giving it the test of time really only amounts to half a review. It takes some perspective to be truly objective.But Siamese Dream has it all. Over a period of seven years, it has continued to be fresh and original. This tour de force is a one-of-a-kind treasure, among the Pumpkins albums and among rock music.Immediate appeal? I was driving home from work one day in 1993 and I heard Cherub Rock on the radio. I had no idea who Smashing Pumpkins were at the time; all I know was that I was completely floored. I simply had to own this! The driving force of the music and the melodic hooks held me like flypaper. Never had I heard such overwhelming power and delicate restraint, not just in the same song, but at the exact same time. As soon as the song ended, I turned around and went and bought the disc. No other time have I had that sort of reaction.Lasting appeal? This disc never leaves my car. Rarely does a week go by when I don't listen to this through beginning to end. Somehow it has never grown old. I can't think of a single other album that has given me as much enjoyment in my entire life.So if you are at all a fan of this genre and don't own this disc, buy it. Even if you have been disappointed by their weaker recent efforts, buy it. The test of time has indicated that this CD is destined to be a true classic. Quite simply, it is the best album of the nineties.
A1A76D2ZB8K1S0	1	1	The people shown in these videos are the ones that the US and Britan are fighting, its too bad that all the liberals of the world only believe what other liberals tell them otherwise this might open some minds.
A1A76D2ZB8K1S0	0	0	Not since Heero have I seen such an overrated movie, just like that movie I am dumbfounded to talk to people who actually liked this movie. And not just Liberals who have a blind admiration for this film due to its political message but some right wingers too.This film was over-acted, over dramatized and under written. The story line is full of holes and where it is not full of holes it tries way too hard to make connections between the present and the events of the past, and the connections which all of our characters seem to have falls into that forced category.The dialogue is drawn out and tries to come across as artistic, many times I found myself zoning out long after the point was made in these pretentious conversations.The fight scenes are nothing revolutionary or exciting, its the same familiar fight scene you see in all "over-hollywooded" movies.This film also perpetuates the growing anti-Christian movement by using a red, modified cross as the Evil State's symbol. On the surface this film tries to preach against hate with the over-played anti-gay thing, in reality it promotes more hatred, bigotry and fascism than Mien Kompf. If there is any political future that this film alludes to it is one of a new wave of hatred against the majority of Americans.
A1A76D2ZB8K1S0	0	1	Yes they are from California, yes Californians like their home state. Yes I am sick and tired about hearing about California and I would love for the Chili Peppers to release an album without a song about California because despite every Californian's beliefs most things that come from California arent very good. Inlcuding this album.
A1A7C398D67SDS	1	0	Oddly enough, at only 23 and having completely missed the 80's music craze, I am a die-hard fan of older-school melodic hard rock.I came across Hardline from being a huge fan of Axel Rudi Pell, and eventually bought Double Eclipse on a whim. I didn't even listen to it for a while since Axel had a new album out and I figured "well, they're both Gioelli, and this one's newer", expecting to hear that trademark high-treble crappy producing that earlier metal and hard rock bands fell victim to.Then one day I popped this into my car's CD player and listened to it from beginning to end... and then I put it back to the beginning, and to make a long story short I listened to this album end-on-end for a five hour car ride.I'm a sucker for melodic metal and hard rock, but something about Hardline's albums strikes a chord with me, and Double Eclipse is by far their best cut. A lot of people say that it's very 'stuck in the 80s' and dated, but the truth of the matter is that it is infinitely more listenable than anything produced by modern record executives. It quite simply rocks.And that's probably the strongest element of Hardline's music, particularly this album. No matter which direction the music industry goes (and give current acts, it looks bad), Double Eclipse will be that hidden gem amongst music aficionados as a symbol of what REAL hard rock is and was. No songs about a girlfriend leaving you, or how much school sucks... No! Everything is crunchy, loud, and at times raunchy and in your face. "Life's a bitch" is a song about just that. Growing up, being a man, and rocking out. Even the ballads, albeit soft and whispy (as a power ballad should be), have an underlying tone of "be a man", in lieu of "cry like a baby" (EG: Every simple plan song ever written; My Chemical Romance; etc).Perhaps Hardline itself is not a paragon of rock and roll, having only cut three albums, but something happened when they recorded Double Eclipse, and whatever it was, it left us with a shining example of how exactly one is supposed to rock.
A1A7C398D67SDS	0	1	I'm not sure what has happened to my Snowball microphone, but I do not like it.I received this for christmas, and it worked amazingly well for about a month before it just stopped responding. I don't know if it was a windows update or something else that happened, but every time I plug the snowball into ANY computer, windows tells me "USB device not recognized". Support from their website is kind of slow and they do not offer ANY drivers for download (which would, usually, fix this kind of problem in a heartbeat).
A1A7CCY9XQUQX	1	1	I can't say anything but wonderful things about this book. A really good gripper that captivates you with out being provactive or overly compelling. It's like the reader just blends in with the setting of the place and you follow the characters around, most of the time it's Harry, like you are actually there. The book is not baffling but nor is it a simple read. It's just right and the characters are well toned. Kid AND ADUTLS will not be able to put this book down and will want to read the second one shortly after.
A1A7CCY9XQUQX	1	1	You'd think the first 007 movie ['Dr No'] would have been the undeniable best but it is not. The best one is 'Goldeneye', 'You Only Live Twice, 'Goldfinger' and 'The World is Not Enough' all in sequential order. Dr No has a weird beginning as is the only Bond film without the classic opening shot with Bond as he takes a gun and shoots it as the screen then quickly turns red. It is also the only one without Q, still is a great movie but not all suspenceful but filled with plot.
A1A7CCY9XQUQX	0	0	. . . such a stupid movie. Being a big Bond fan I was hugely dissapointed by 'The World is Not Enough'. Sophie Marceau is good playing the main villian, Electra King. I gave the way the surpise she is a bad guy, oh yeah baby!
A1A7CCY9XQUQX	0	1	Varsity Blues [Rated R, Starring Jon Voight and James Van Der Beek] You would never have thought the most bleek and depressing film of the year happens to be about football but alas it does. Completely conventional and cookie cut outed from other films the outcome; I give 'Varsity' one of my Movie Awards for the year, being the most stereotypic of them all. - CP
A1A7OAQB7R304S	1	1	John Browning is one of the greatest firearms designers the world has ever known. Many of his designs are still in production over one hundred years after they were first sold. Some of these like the 1911A1 45 caliber pistol, which is approaching 100 years of continuous production, are still considered the benchmark from which all other semi automatic pistols are judged. As evidence of his genius, some of his machine guns and pistols he designed for the US Army are still are issued by various branches of the US Military and used in the Iraq war 80 years after his death.To give the reader more of an idea of the importance of this person in firearms design, every lever action rifle, machinegun, and semi auto shotgun rifle or handgun made in the last 100 plus years incorporates a variation of or direct copy a Browning patent in the design. Even the Soviet AK-47 has design features which are taken directly from his patents.Whether you like guns or not or just interested in the historical aspect, this is a very good book on the subject. Not only does this book cover John Browning's life as a prolific gun maker and inventor and to some extent his father, it also covers his life as a child and a young man as well as accounts of how his firearms effected the history of a new nation. This is also to a certain extent a historical look at a segment the early American west and the Mormon migration to Utah.This is a a great book and very well written I highly recomend it.
A1A7OAQB7R304S	1	1	My wife and I knew Duane, Mark and Lillian Chynoweth in the mid 1980's. We originally met them in 1983 through a string of transactions, used appliance trades and parts purchases through the family business. They owned Reliance Appliance in Southwest Houston. I had been in the family home several times on business. I found the family normal, friendly and quite nice.I was startled and shocked when we found out about the murders. Even more startled at the story that unfolded in the media as well as this book about the past lives they had lead in Mexico and later in the US. Many unanswered questions haunted me for years. At least until I read this book. From what I knew of them and what I saw I can say that the Author has done an exhaustive amount of work and appears to be accurate as he could be from the information he researched. If anyone is interested in their lives, who they were and how this tragedy unfolded, I highly recommend this book.
A1A7OAQB7R304S	1	1	This connector has been upgraded and redesigned by the manufacturer and is a much better design than the previous model under the same part number. Good price and design for the money.
A1A8I2MUMRQFB6	1	1	I use these at night and at nap-time for my potty-training three-year-old who is not yet accident-free (I was getting pretty tired of changing bedding). So far, they have worked like a charm and nothing underneath the pad has gotten wet. I bought two so I can have a backup when one needs washing. They wash up nicely (no bleeding) and don't take too long to dry. There is no care label, so I just wash them in warm water and hang to dry. Another bonus to these particular pads is they are made in the US. All in all, I'm satisfied with them and would buy them again if necessary.
A1A8I2MUMRQFB6	1	1	I bought a Vic Firth Pepper Mill just like this one about 10 years ago, and it is still going strong. I took one star away because the grind is sometimes a slight bit more coarse than I like, and I have a hard time adjusting it to a finer grind. It takes a bit of extra twisting of the knob at the top to make sure the grind is right, but I do get it eventually. At any rate, I have still really enjoyed using this US made product and wouldn't hesitate to purchase another pepper mill from Vic Firth... that is if the one I have ever stops working. It works every bit as well as it did a decade ago, so I'm not sure it will ever need replacing.
A1A8I2MUMRQFB6	1	1	This is such a fun album with plenty of high-energy tunes, great for dancing. I've loved every song they released as a single and wonder why it took me so long to finally purchase an album.
A1A8O3QT0B6QJE	1	1	I love this dvd, I watch it all the time. I want to get the cd too, so I can put the songs on my Ipod. The only dvd I need from them is, En Vivo Gira Mexico 2005. I want it so bad!!! I love to watch these guys perform as much as I like to hear them on my stereo. What matters is I love the dvd and I am sure you will too!!
A1A8O3QT0B6QJE	1	1	This album was good. I give it 4 stars. The cd came with a dvd too. The dvd has music videos, photogallery, and the making of the music video, Antes Muerta Que Sencilla. My favorite songs are, Antes Muerta Que Sencilla and Cambiemos los Papeles. The song, Gracias Mama I loved too it is a sad and thanking song. The cd was good and so was the dvd too!! I loved it as much as Y Seguimos Con Duranguense!!!
A1A8O3QT0B6QJE	0	0	Out of all their CDs this one I would say is the worst!!! I only found 2 out of 10 interesting which are, Paloma Errante and Caballo Mojino. The other ones are just not good enough. I love this group alot. It makes me feel bad to write a bad review of their albums, but it's the truth.
A1A8P9NLASR5R5	1	1	High quality XLR cable that is very reasonably priced. I use it with conviction in my studio. I would recommend this cable well above an overpriced one from a competing, known-to-be-highly-litigious company.
A1A8P9NLASR5R5	1	0	This book came as my fourth attempt to procure a children's Bible for my 5-year-old. Previously examined children's Bibles were either too difficult for young children (and who thought of promoting a Middle English paraphrase to a young audience?)or too dilute with ultimate loss of the biblical message (but let's hear it for the cartoonish illustrations). In the cases of the former, my son would lose interest thanks to the "thee"s and "thou"s stringing together awkward and inverted sentence structures filled with stilted vocabulary. Inexcusable for a modern paraphrase. In the latter, my son would lose interest because of lacking substance (i.e., the absence of biblical truth or moral lesson). This book gets it right. The written material accomplishes what a children's bible should (i.e., biblical teaching) and the illustrations are quality -- not the all-too-common goofy character depictions that detract from seriousness of any underlying message. My son looks forward to our nightly Bible readings; moreover, he is absorbing the material and valuing it.
A1A8P9NLASR5R5	1	0	I'm very proud of Ben for having the courage to make this documentary. As someone trained to the doctorate level in the sciences, I was exposed to the indoctrination of a godless evolution, beginning with introductory biology courses my first year of undergraduate school. I heard all the dogma concerning Darwinism; it was preached as fact and not theory, and the gaping "holes" in that theory were never addressed, at least to my satisfaction. At no time, did I find it convincing as an explanation for the "origin of species," and I found it unsatisfactory in explaining life as we now see it in our natural world. The textbooks promoted the regurgitated notions of life beginning in the ancient, inchoate world from the "primordial soup" of water and basic elements exposed to unspecified high energy sources. This "soup" was never intellectually filling; the more that I studied, the more I began to see the evidences of intelligent design. The truth is that Science and militant commitment to Darwinism as an explanation for the origin of life has become a religion unto itself. True science, the brand that Newton subscribed to, supports the existence of the Creator; the Creator, however, has never been subject to science. Unfortunately, our world is now populated with a false science that arrogantly supposes, where it is only catching a glimpse of God's workmanship in creation, that each of its minutest findings promote the accomplishments of man while disproving the existence of God. This is nothing more than a sad rebellion and the religion of free will, something more to be pitied. When intelligence is combined with humility and an earnest quest for truth, then true science results, and this only pays tribute to the Creator. I have never met an atheistic evolutionist who wasn't plagued by his own pride. It is the most supreme form of arrogance to say that God does not exist. False science is threatened by even the discussion of intelligent design (or, the existence of the Creator), because the existence of an Intelligent Designer dethrones them and the reality of the Creator involves a coming perfect judgment that they do not want to face. No, it is better for them to work to stamp out the last seeds of Intelligent Design and its more perfect form, Creationism, than to face other possibilities. They will continue this crusade, even though it has meant attacking the other side from a very unscientific platform.

A1A9FTLF4AK785	0	0	This is my first "hard" sci-fi book. After not reading sci-fi for 20 years, I rediscovered it with Robert Charles Wilson (highly recommended) and thought I would branch out a bit. Well, there are 2 kinds of sci-fi writers. Those whom use the characters to get to the science and those whom use the science to get to the characters. Mr. Metzger is the latter. Invariably the latter fail to engage you emotionally or ultimately psychologically. Strictly intellectual writing bores me. This book is heavy on intellect and light on emotional insight. Interesting but boring.....
A1A9FTLF4AK785	0	0	Inventive in its own disgusting way, but ultimately vile and pointless. I doubt I'll read another of his books...
A1A9FTLF4AK785	0	1	Harris makes some interesting assertions on the origins of democracy (the warrior state of Sparta, the Protestant Reformation) and the nature of the Islamic conflict with the West. What I found rather astonishing though was his unwillingness to turn the "fantasy ideology" lense on our own leadership (GWB and friends). Fundamentalism is the real enemy...

A1A9LNWITVYM1Z	0	0	I have been an avid Kay Scarpetta fan ever since discovering the series many years ago. However, I have been severely disappointed with where Cornwell has taken the storylines over the last few books. I have to admit I was hesitant to buy another Scarpetta mystery after wasting money to buy the last few novels.... but I had hoped that maybe Cornwell had realized the error of her ways (that and I have to admit, Kay was one of my favorite fictional characters).While Predator was an improvement from the last two novels (which isn't really saying much), it still was lacking in several categories:- The plot line is not clearly fleshed out and there is very minimal character development. I found myself getting confused and having to go back to chapters to figure out the connections.- Again, frustrating storylines that do not leave the reader with a sense of satisfaction or conclusion.Predator was also unnecessarily long winded. For a book of its length I expected much more.... instead all I got was a half-developed story and familiar characters who didn't do anything of interest.
A1A9LNWITVYM1Z	0	0	I was eager to dive into this book after hearing positive reviews about it. Unfortunately, while I enjoyed the first hundred or so pages, I found the rest to drag on... and on... and on. I love reading and normally will eat through a book I enjoy within two or three days. It took me two weeks to finish this novel, partly because after the first quarter of the book I didn't care what happened to the characters.Though the atmosphere that Ms. Pessi creates is entrancing and completely envelopes the reader, one is constantly distracted by nonsensical citations and random pieces of information. I felt almost sometimes that her usage of illustrative examples from history, science, literature, etc. took away from my enjoyment of the book. It eventually got to the point where I skipped entire chunks of the novel because the story was moving so slowly.I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters. While Ms. Pessi does a good job of developing them, the reader is still left with many unsettling questions about the protagonists.The book is rather similar to Donna Tartt's Secret History,so if you liked that, you will probably enjoy Special Topics in Calamity Physics, though be warned! The editors would have been wise to cut this book down by at least a third.
A1A9LNWITVYM1Z	1	1	As a child, I grew up in a household that always had dogs. However, growing up with dogs and having one of your own is a completely different story! After recently getting a puppy, I found I was calling home almost every day with questions for my parents about my pup's progression until I heard about this book. The Dog Bible is fantastic!! It has solutions or recommendations for almost any dog related question you can throw at it. I've been pleasantly surprised that whenever I've gone seeking an answer, the book has magically had it- it's like it reads my mind! While I was skeptical at first, as most dog books tend to be for the uber-beginner, this book is written with even an experienced handler in mind. It has great advice for both city and dogs that live in the suburbs. All in all, this is must-have for any one with a dog!
A1A9UHWUQPVPNM	1	1	I bought this Walkout set many years ago on cassette tape and used it a lot! I was thrilled to finally get in MP3. I have it now on my MP3 layer and it feels like an old friend, only better! Downloading was easy. I made copies both on my computer and on a DVD disk so I won't have to repurchase it if my MP3 players and computer both, fail.
A1A9UHWUQPVPNM	1	1	I have many pillows that are not working. I have been waking up with consistant and moderate to severe neck pain that triggers migraines almost every morning for months now. I switch pillows and the pain is less for a few days, then gets worse, so I switch and it gets better then worse and so goes the pattern.I bought this pillow, Arc 4 Life, and followed the instructions of sleeping with it knowing that it may be a bit uncomfortbale for the first night or two. It was not uncomfortable for the first couple of hours then I did noticed my neck feeling a little tired, so I simply turned the pillow so the softer neck support part was under my neck and slept well for the rest of the night. I had very little neck pain the first morning and have had zero pain since then, now about six weeks.I love this pillow, I just shared it with my ladies group. One woman came to our weekly gathering with a horrible headache and tension in her neck. I showed her this pillow and we all moved into the living room so she could lay down on the pillow and see if it would help her neck while we all talked and she relaxed. She had taken some medicine and one of the other ladies gave her a neck rub, so all of those factors contributed to her headache going away, but she is so impressed with the pillow and gives it most of the credit.I'm now here ordering two more pillows for her and the woman wo gave her the massage, I am guessing I will be back here ordering more pillows as their husbands get a chance to try the pillows out for themselves. Very few things in life have worked so well as this simple little pillow. It works well for sleeping on my back or on my side. It never slides away and leaves my neck unsupported, which is exactly what happened with so many other pillows and why I would wake up with a painful neck the next morning. I absolutely reccommend this pillow, it is well worth the money.
A1A9UHWUQPVPNM	1	1	Does what it should, easy to assemble. The color was not as nice as I was expecting, but still ok.
A1A9UHWUQPVPNM	0	0	I don't know what it is that smells, but there is a smell so strong that I have had to throw them out. I washed them, and the smell was just as bad. Maybe it's the material the glitter things are made of, or the glue that keeps them on, I don't know, but I bought three of these caps, wore them maybe once, loved them, but then they started to smell and out they went. Total waste of money.
A1A9UHWUQPVPNM	0	1	I chose this supplement because of all the wonderful ingredients, and I think that is all still great. But the resulting pill is huge, not surprising, and I'm a great pill swallower. I can, and do swallow several pills at a time with no problem. But this one is not only huge, but not well coated, so it got caught in my throat probably 1 out of three times. The aftertaste is just way too herbal, grassy tasting for me. I suspect it is the spuralina. I mostly noticed the taste after the times I had to wrestle up and down my throat a few times to get it to cooperate. I did finish my order and will not reorder. I'm sad about that, truly I was so hopeful that I had found a great mix of herbal and multivitamins. (sigh)
A1AA2GMT5UTXO3	0	0	I have read every book in the Alex Cross series and this one is, by far, the worst. First of all, I would suggest that James Patterson do some research on diplomatic immunity and some other small legal doctrines before he decides to write books about such topics. Secondly, the character of Alex Cross needs to have more flaws. In all of the books with Alex Cross, he seems to be able to do no wrong. Finally, I found the whole kidnapping plot, especially the end, incredibly hokey and unbelieveable. I found myself saying &quot;yeah right&quot; at the end of the book and shaking my head in disgust. I have about had it with the Alex Cross series. Unless the next book is 100% better, then I am through with Patterson.
A1AA2GMT5UTXO3	1	1	This book is not your typical John Grisham courtroom style of story. I think it's the mark of a good author, however, when one can journey away from their traditional style of writing successfully. Grisham has done this both with this book and with the Testament. I do enjoy his courtroom dramas, and even though this book did not involve that, it was still an entertaining read.
A1AA2GMT5UTXO3	1	1	This is a great source of knowledge for all people seeking truth in their spirituality, and for those who cannot accept religion on blind faith. I would highly recommend reading Sylvia's other books first (Adventures of a Psychic and The Other Side and Back). Those give you enough background information to be able to follow along in this book. The one complaint I would have is that it is quite a bit of information to absorb in one reading...but you are warned of that at the beginning of the book. I am looking forward to the rest of the Journey of the Soul books! Good work, once again, Sylvia!
A1AA2GMT5UTXO3	1	1	Even though much of the information on Sylvia's background contained in this book was information I had read in her other works, I still feel that this was a treasure trove of information that will be very useful to all who read it. I have read all of Sylvia's books thus far and I do feel as if this one is perhaps the most informative.For those who have read other books by Sylvia, you won't want to miss this one. It really gives you an idea of what the Other Side is like. For those of you who have not read her other books, this will make you want to read them!Good work, once again, Sylvia!
A1AA6F5HEUZ4MA	0	1	I bought four of these when they first came out. At first they were great, but within a year, just beyond the warrantee period BTW, all four had gotten their volume stuck in either the minimum or maximum positions. The JBL web site doesn't even list the speakers by name, you have to look it up by model number (TEAK-48-180080000/U/M/V/VB1/A/J/K for those of you who are curious), and if you don't enter it just right, then it sends you to 404 world. Once you do get to the support page, the only thing it says to do is to reset your iPod. I don't see how resetting my iPod would help with the volume problem because it happens when I have my computer connected via a speaker cable.
A1AA6F5HEUZ4MA	0	1	This film is like a reflecting pool. It looks deep and dark, but it turns out to be about three inches deep.The stunning look of the film belies its shallowness. The deep shadows and brilliant highlights make the case that more movies should be made in black and white. The concepts could have been interesting to explore, but the wooden acting and stilted dialog made it painful to watch, pain which was relieved only when ogling Ms Masterson and Ms Kipleigh.All in all it seemed to me to be a case of a screenwriter/director writing a first draft, then filming it. With a little bit of polish applied to the storyline and script, this film could have been really good.
A1AA6F5HEUZ4MA	0	1	This is a slow moving, self important and ponderous movie about an aristocrat pilot who flies in a red plane. It is also completely fictitious. Technically he could be called a red baron, but even though they claim it, this movie is not at all about "The Red Baron". This movie would have you believe that von Richtofen and Roy Brown were friendly rivals competing for the love of some anonymous nurse. Even the flying scened look fake, like they were doing a CG version of a 1950's style miniature of a dogfight. As a romance it stinks and as a biopic it borders on being eligible to be sued by both the von Richtofen and Brown families for libel.

A1AABRVYCPVPQY	0	0	Good graphics, but....THE BOSSES REALLY STINK! Too easy, too repetitive, too well, just BLAH! If you want the worlds are too short, too easy, and they give you the answer to the missions! No secrets, all you do is jump, roll, and stare. The regular monsters don't have health, they just die instantly. Plus, the whole game is a waste! The plot doesn't even go the way it should! I guess if you want an easy, stupid-plotted game, pick this one, but if youwant serious game play, look away!
A1AABRVYCPVPQY	1	1	Lord of the rings: The Two towers is an awesome game! With medioker graphics, and awesome levels, this game is a ton of non-stop fun. Fight creatures and see cutscenes from the movie. You can do specialty moves and combos, power up, and feel like you are realy fighting with the characters. For extreme fun and inneraction, buy this game, for its worth every penny.
A1AAD71RWXEEVC	0	0	I really wish i had took the time to watch this before i spent $14.99 on this crap. There was no story whatsoever (if it was i didn't understand it), the acting was garbage, everything about it was garbage. This is not even a good bad movie (Dolemite, Plan 9 From Outer Space). I would have thought that with Wood Harris in this that it would have been at least somewhat watchable, but nope. Just a terrible waste of talent & time.
A1AAKBCCJUO12K	1	1	This is a gorgeous product. I had a few of the old grainy ones that came out years ago and gave up even trying to look at them.I'll never understand what took so long for someone to realize how much this whole series is loved and is so deserving of atop notch production of every season. I urge whoever it was to hurry up with the rest! People are running out of oxygen from holding their breaths! And thank you, Amazon, for this treat.
A1AAKBCCJUO12K	0	1	[[ASIN:B0002XIC0U Quaker Old Fashioned White Grits 1 lb 8 oz. container - 6 Unit Pack]Absolutely tasteless goo. Not a hint of true flavor found in the original Quaker Old Fashion grits and I don't mean the more recent "Instant" and "Quick" Quaker grits. I was appalled. I hope Amazon will find something better.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	a friend of mine and i were talking about how much we wanted holgas but couldn't find them... so when i saw this on here i immediately bought two kits, one for me and one for her.and YES IT COMES WITH THE CAMERA. i just wanted to say that. but the whole package is great! comes with film, batteries, a poster extolling the virtues of lomography, a mini-handbook for the camera itself, incredibly easy to use. and what i think really makes the package is the "HOLGA - life through a plastic lens" book, with Holga enthusiasts, experts and aficionados giving you tips and sharing their images. Such a charming book, breathtaking pictures, and inspiring because it shows you what this cheap little thing is capable of. and they also give you cool little tricks for modifying the camera and different effects you can get and so on. so... yeah.Buy it!
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	i had ordered the original and through a mix up got sent the remake instead... i figured i would watch it. i am NOT a fan of remade movies, but i was pleasantly surprised! it seemed to me to be a good, strong horror movie, and it redressed the gross wrongs put forth by the original. what won me over was when leatherface hangs one character on the meathook -- in the original, pam just keeps screaming the same screams she already is. watching the remake, i found myself saying, "damn right. now THAT'S how you get hung on a meat hook". it was drawn out, grotesque, brutal and fun... so much more enjoyable than the haphazard-ness of the original.also to me the sheriff might be one of the better characters in a while... he reminds me of every wierd wacked-out scoutmaster i have ever encountered, only 100X more so and on speed. and with a gun. and he eats people.there is a rich back-story here, you really get a sense of the whole thing being woven together in time and that somewhere out there in texas this really could happen. i felt the original had no grit, no reality to it. this one did. it was detailed, well shot, and the house might just be the scariest house i have ever seen. and shocking as all hell. still, it is a mostly a good horror movie, with some flaws, and it could never be considered a GREAT horror movie, but it's fine viewing and it revamps the original story very well.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	0	1	wow... just finished it, and can i just say that this is one of those books i have finished out of spite alone, so i can say the book didn't get the better of me.i have heard john updike described as "a penis with a thesaurus", and i can tell you this book illustrates that comment perfectly. if you are not averse to reading pages devoted to golf games, or accounts of an aging man doting on his penis for paragraphs on end, read this book because it delivers. there are short bursts of beauty, but it is all so incredibly brief and so quickly disregarded that it is irritating more than engaging. so self-indulgent, so crass - - i have also heard it said about the author, concerning his overexposure in the literary world, that "the new yorker seems to publish everything but his income taxes". i think he pieces together a few things, throws it all into a manuscript and says "here you go", evidenced by the great ideas he presents, and does nothing with. For example, FedEx taking over the government, a moon-sized manned satellite abandoned by the people on earth, the fallout after a "sino-american conflict"... a more competent writer could work absolute wonders with these ideas i feel, and he just seems content to mention them in passing and describe ad nauseam his long-term trist with a foul-mouthed crack whore, or his second wife's flower beds over and over and over and over again. john updike is written proof that if you are a sexist, classist prick with a single influential novel, a big vocabulary and a bit of money, you can turn out endless amounts of crap and people will eat it up.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	it is chilling when you find a book that speaks so directly to your soul, or of your soul. the virgin suicides that book. at least for me. it is dark, surreal in a magical-realism sort of way. it is so hard to describe... too many superlatives for this book. it reads so quickly, you just fall into it. one of it's major successes, i think, is that as you read along, you begin to realize that the narrator isn't some sterile, distant voice from the clouds, it is very real. and it is obsessed with it's subjects. and since it is your only window into this world, you become tainted with that obsession too. rich description, powerful symbols, i would recommend this to everyone.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	wow... dark, atmospheric. it's pretty creepy in a very backwoods sort of way. the way i've been describing it is "somewhere between 'revolution 9' and 'deliverance'". the only problem it has, and it is a big one, is that it is only a half an hour long! maybe they thought people might not be able to take anymore. i would have taken a lot more.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	wow... what amazing people, and what an amazing book! i finished it in two days, that's how easy and addicting it is to read. very detailed, and full of great pictures. i closed the book wishing that i could be there, somehow, at the factory in the sixties; i felt like i had bonded with Edie, Billy, Brigid, Candy, Jackie, Holly, Nico... it is a profoundly sad and haunting book, considering how the majority of these people are dead from liver failure, cancer, overdose, suicide. i will definitely read it again and again.
A1AAU7W8G6KDE3	1	1	I do not know how this book was presented to the english-speaking general public of 1944 but it appears to be an incredibly in-depth lexicon of the propaganda language enforced by the Nazi movement upon the people in their governance. It also discusses in detail the infrastructure behind all Nazi organizations such as the Hitler Youth and the Waffen SS in a plain manner without editorial. It does not seem to me that an average american would want to be found with this book in any day and age, let alone in 1944 so the true nature of this book is a great mystery to me. Who had it and used it? Was it a covert government document? A field guide for use in espionage? A Nazi how-to for english speakers? As a piece of social history it is quite fascinating. From a moral standpoint it is frightening. Yet it is here. Found in the strangest of places. Skinny sinister little red book.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	After a surprising amount of product research for a mixer I purchased this one and I must say after reading tons of reviews on mixers of all things this one clearly beat the rest. I must say this mixer has met all expectations so far, and the stand feature is an excellent bonus. Other reviews seemed concerned that the mixers don't reach the bottom of the bowl, I don't really see how they could be much lower as my guess is they are only a quarter or half inch from the bottom. If you were mixing something thick for a long time the hands free feature would far outweigh the occaional scoop with a rubber spatula. The motor has a nice strong healthy sound, and the product itself has a nice solid feel. I'm a guy just starting to play around with cooking, and I think buying this was a good first step in outfitting a quality food prep kitchen.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	What can I say? It does everything it is supposed to do at a fantastic price. I purchased this for my office and am very pleased. Yes, one review mentions that it doesn't print close to the margins, but knowing that I am still impressed. One should also note that feeding multiple pages in the top feeder; sometimes one will go in crooked. Those are the only two things about the machine itself. The print quality is great, and the cartridges are readily available on Amazon. The setup process was pretty quick although there is a never ending list of updates to the software itself which will take about an hour to complete.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	Very easy to follow book of some great places to go and visit. Grab you GPS and get out and have some fun.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	0	0	In a thick amount this product hardens up but the falls off. It has an oily residue which seems to prevent it from bonding to a surface. I ended up just taking my board to a repair shop.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	I can't put in words how happy I am to finally have found a genuine lemon curd product. I'm glad another reviewer mentioned some key words about the texture and flavor, because I was reading reviews for different brands.As soon as you get the jar, you'll immediately notice the colour ;) looks just right. It actually looks lemony. The best part comes when you turn the lid hearing that pop of freshness and actually smell it. Childhood memories instantly come to mind and you know you finally found the real deal.The taste is just right and the consistency is sort of like mushed apple baby food. I can't even say how often I have been disappointed by trying a store bought jar of lemon curd. I've seen every consistency from stuff that is slimy to a consistency of flan with liquid seperating out of it.I hope this product is very successful. I'd like to enjoy something that I feared I won't be able to replace in the future and because I don't think the American market has ever had a real product available. I'm sure it will finally catch on here.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	It's just a light bulb but I have to say a year later and it is still going. I literally replaced the original a month after getting the microwave and this one is still nice and bright compared to the other original one which is dim and looks like it is going to die any day now.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	This is handy to keep all your hex keys in one convenient place. So glad I can pass all my loose ones on.
A1AAWWGOC8ZREP	1	1	I got this so that I would always have a precision tool set handy. I like the the pliers, I don't really like the plastic tops on the screwdrivers and the screwdrivers are wedged so tightly that you have to be careful not to poke yourself when putting them away. Still, it is a complete small tool set, in fact I also store a small hex key set in the case. The quality overall is fine for what they are.
A1AB9STUJA17OH	1	0	This book is strangely inventive and imaginative, ironic in some ways, and impossible to leave it untouched for even a day. Not the ordinary hee-haa comedy sort of book, Behindlings leaves you wanting for more after reading every chapter. Barker's style of writing is fantastic, undoubtedly, and the book is, perhaps, colorful. No matter a bookaholic or not, Behindlings is a book worth your time, money, and focus.
A1AB9STUJA17OH	1	1	This is absolutely a record to love. Even though the regular bassist-gone-solo is not usually a fortunate news to hear, but Melissa Auf der Maur is an exception. She will stun you with her surprisingly powerful and magnetic voice, delievering beautiful, strong, and catchy rock tunes with a touch of edge, along with her unique and wistful lyrics. It's probably too hard a task to pick out a song you don't like. Though you might need to take longer time with several songs that you don't get attached to immediately.In conclusion, this is definitely one of the best CDs so far, and nobody should miss this bassist out, for Auf der Maur is so much more than just that.Note : She sounds nothing like Courtney Love.
A1ABCPX8VEWYD	0	1	I am very dissatisfied with this product, as it does not play continuously through. There are NO marks or scratches on any of the disc, they just won't play through. The first 2 episodes on each one will play and then the disc starts making noise and returns back to the beginning episode.Never had any problems with the first 4 seasons, and I'm very upset about this!! I would like a refund or a set that I CAN WATCH!!!
A1ABFCSCDLDY9K	0	1	I am a huge John Mayer fan, especially of his live recordings. I was surprised by this record as he does not appear take his musical arrangements to the next step. John's first cd speaks to a potential filled with songs infused with funk, melodic lines, intelligent lyrics and thoughful composition. He did not perform up to his potential.What he delivered was what one would expect from a 10 day studio session, during which 9 new songs were created due to record label pressure to get the new songs out. Unlike his first record, these songs were not road tested... they are not the finely crafted product of a young adult's life. Rather, they are nice, boring pop songs, with very little original composition or inspired development.He can do so much better and I am sure he knows it. The guy needs to take some time off from nearly 1.5 years on the road and push himself to produce art that is truly inspired and creative.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I had been a Cincinnati fan for years when I moved to the bay area. So it was natural to gravitate towards the Giants. As I recall they had a terrible team when I started listening (including the hilarious Crazy Crab ) during 1984.I haven't started the book yet but I can't wait. Hank was simply one of the cleverest announcers I've ever heard. I think anyone who spent any time listening to him and his excellent sense of humor will always know they aren't getting all they could out of a broadcast by any other announcer. (Even those supposedly brilliant "Hall of Famers" who may have announced for the Reds).Just reading some of the excerpts from the book brought his brilliantly cagey style back to mind.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	0	1	I picked this book up without looking closely enough at the actual exercises, of which there are many. I should have noticed that they actually require a fairly advanced German Vocabulary to even complete the simplest of drills. This was noticeable even at the very first set of exercises.If you are somewhat advanced in your German vocabulary though, this may be very helpful as there are very many drills and exercises that follow the explanations of usage. It's just really not something a beginning German student would be able to use as its just too frustrating to complete the drill/exercises when you don't really understand what the words mean. A beginner would just require too much time spent using a dictionary.If you're a beginner I would suggest a grammar book that offers a more balanced presentation of information; one that starts the student at the beginning and requires little, if any, prior knowledge of German.I should probably condition my rating as being '2 stars' if your a beginner and '4 stars' if your advanced enough in your overall German to be able to understand the exercises.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	0	I just bought my 3rd. The first one I dropped too many times. The second one I lost. I just don't see anything better on the market.Cons: The battery compartment door doesn't lock as well as it could and the batteries sometimes fall out at inconvenient times. The color makes it seem kind of toyish. It has XP issues, but the work-around program seemed to work good enough. I've not used it for a web cam on XP though. It worked fine with Win/98 though.Pros: Its lens can be focused for close ups; this is a rare feature for small web/digital cams as many can't focus on anything under 3 feet. Picture quality is very good. I use a digital camera for work but the battery life of my 'good' camera is just ridiculously short. I use this as a replacement as the images are fine for most outdoor shots.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I have only read a few chapters of the book so far..I will update this when I finish it.So far all I can say is that it seems to be well written and reads as if no translation had been done at all. There are about 70 short 'segments' ranging from 1 to 5 pages, each dealing with a particular location/personality, which makes for easy reading. Enough detail to keep it interesting interspersed with with good large scale insights about how the actions taken (or not taken) before the battle affected it. Also, just enough dialogue to allow one to get a sense of the character's personality.I will leave the critical review of its facts to others as I don't know enough to rate them.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I chose this book over 'German Grammar Drills' by Ed Swick because it seemed to be the one I would continue to use. While Swick's book might cover slightly more grammatic technicalities, this one does much the same, but in a less exhausting manner.There are 87 units/chapters with each being about 1-2 pages long and containing 3 sets of quiz questions, ranging between 5-10 questions per set.I have looked at many of the 'Teach Yourself' books before but have always found them to be second tier material in the way they constantly base their chapters upon dialogs at a library or bank or an airport. I never liked the way the grammar rules seemed to be addressed in such a willy-nilly manner. That's where this book differs. There are no dialogs and it simply addresses grammar topics in a straightforward approach, building up gradually from the most basic.It's got a very good ratio of lessons/rules to questions/exercises.While this probably wouldn't be considered anything near an exhaustive reference of grammar, I think its a book you might actually finish studying.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	0	I picked this up at a library used book sale of donated items. I paid zero for it as it was used and not many people want these large textbooks around the house.But after paging through the book it really is very nicely arranged with chapters very logically presented with enough, but not an overwhelming amount of of text to slog through until the next heading appears. I find it very appealing visually with a great balance of maps (nice ones), photos and side panels. This is a book I would have considered keeping after using it in a class.Sometimes its just nice to reach for a book to read about some battle or treaty or geographic region without using the internet to learn something.In my case, it will be used for filling in historical periods which I might be curious about. It would be worth a few dollars but I can't say more than $20 for a reference work.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	This book was a fascinating history of mining, railroading and speculation. You don't have to know the area at all to enjoy the book but I wished I had the topo maps while I was reading it, it's that detailed.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	This was one of my most satisfying on-line purchase ever. The product works great and the price is fantastic. I bought two because the shipping was the same.I bought the Brown version so the embossing issue is non-existent, and probably not that big of a deal for their lighter versions either.The only negative I can think of is that the inner compartment isn't remotely suitable to use to hold any cash money you might want to get to without a struggle. Keeping any number of bills in this holder pretty much defeats its reason to be. I'd keep an emergency big bill or two in it, but not anything you'd be using several times a day.Buy more than one, you'll find a use for the extra ones.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I needed a simple, quick way to monitor an elderly family member's BP and needed one fast so I bought this vs the others it competes with. It really boiled down to this one vs the lesser model (629 I think). After reading nearly all the reviews of both models and agonizing over choosing just one, the 650 is what I chose.It turns out that many of the complaints about its APS option were unwarranted because you can easily turn it off, or back on.Another complaint was that it didn't show the time..also untrue, the time and date cycle one after the other. It held all the info from the last 30 readings.Another reason I went with it was it had a specific setting for checking the pressure using the right arm, which was a necessity in my case.We experimented with the APS and it seemed to work as stated. Not very difficult to use at all. The beeping wasn't very loud, though not a problem at home. I really don't use the APS anymore as its not hard to position it correctly after seeing where it is on the body when it automatically starts running. I did use it while taking the pressure of someone while lying down; it was picky but I felt safer using it in that situation.If you're on the fence you might do what I did and download the owner's manuals for the models you're considering. That really clarified a lot of the negative reviews I saw. Especially the capability of turning off the APS and the Wrist Positioning features, which you don't need after just a few uses.One drawback was not being able to delete individual readings from memory or being able to record the readings for more than one person. Not a big concern in my case.Bottom line: Worth the few extra bucks for the bells and whistles, given that they can very easily be turned off, or back on.If in doubt, DOWNLOAD THE MANUALS FROM THE OMRON WEBSITE..its free.Update: Looks like the price difference between the 629 and the 650 is a bit wider now. Might not be worth the extra dollars if you don't need the extra features. I'd think the actual innards of both models are the same, the difference only being the APS and irregular heart rate features.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	As has been stated before, the book is great in that it describes the thought processes on how both men AND machines were positioned and deployed on the front lines. It's not full of never ending acts of bravery, just realistic decisions which had to be made mostly BEFORE the battles occurred, which I found fascinatingly detailed.Generally, it described the way about 100-300 men were deployed including where they were in relation to where they thought attacks would come from and also how the troops were utilized (over varying topography, weather, time of day) during both large and small assaults. While the book describes some large troop deployments and battles it shines in describing smaller battles involving less than 50 men, and that's including both sides.Especially enlightening on how vital artillery was in even the small skirmishes.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I started reading this as I was interested in German life during the war. In this aspect it was full of very interesting information about how daily life went for typical Germans.The Christianity aspect of the book was there but didn't overpower the book at all. Actually, the book could have easily been published by a non-christian publisher as the story is more centered upon Hansi's life during (and then after) the war, with the religious aspect seeming to be just part of the story and not the entire story (which made the book that much more interesting).
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	I am so glad I bought this years ago and held onto for all this time. I have owned the larger version of this book and think that this one is much better.The larger version simply is full of useless pages of not so usefull charts and diagrams and just useless graphics. This version is the one you would actually use. I find it's tallish size and two column pages promote it's being a handbook and not a textbook. You end up spending just enough time in it as necessary for a handbook.There are plenty of USEFULL charts, high quality pen and ink drawings, and maps on 95%+ of the pages which breaks things up nicely, visually.The book seems to provide just the right amount of intellectual relief from the biblical text..similar to casually discussing things you've read with a friend, as reinforcement for understanding.Though old, it's actually better tham most recent bible 'handbooks' available and worth picking up as a used book.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	As I suspected, this arrived with a ridiculously dull blade.If you used this without it being first sharpened you will probably hate it because your arms will be doing all the work and not the blade. The blade is not only thick at the cutting edges, its also covered with a thick coat of paint.Still, its a good find as I couldn't find these in the local stores, and I've been looking for years.It's just like the ones your Dad probably had, just not honed to a killer sharp edge.It measured 34.5" from the top to the lowest bend which is still functional if you're over 6' tall.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	0	But now it seems to be the sole link that keeps me doing any bible reading. As another sharp reviewer has mentioned, the big 5 on the cover seems to provide just enough 'nudge' to get you picking it up again and reading because after a while you realize how short five minutes is.I listen to the radio during the day and I know how long a top of the hour newsbreak lasts (about 7 minutes now) and since the news is often so depressing to listen to one more time, I found that you can easily at least do an initial read from this book. It really is nicely divided up into segments where one topic could be taken from the reading.The author's pre-reading sentence seems to focus the reading and keeps you from going off into untimely tangents.The after reading 'probing' questions really don't do much for me. They seem a bit preachy.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	The book is laid out with 1/3 of each page having between 3 or 10 problems for you to solve before you move on in the text. They are arranged along the outer edge of the page, vertically. It's all self guided with the text of the book telling you which of the 'edge problems' to work out before proceeding, usually 2-4 problems.The answers to ALL of these problems are provided. At the end of the chapters are problems with the odd problem answers given.I looked at many algebra textbooks but this one is one you'd actually use, primarily because of it's methodical step by step pace.It's pretty good at starting at the beginning of Algebra but I don't think it takes you too far into Algebra II, but maybe the author has that covered in another book.

A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	Like just about everyone else has mentioned the supplied instructions just had me scratching my head..until I just slipped it into the hinge to see how it fit. Then it becomes clear how it works.The problem is that the way they tell you to install it is pretty much impossible to do because once it's in the hinge there is no clearance to rotate a wrench enough to go as far around as you need to. I gave up after an hour before I started throwing tools through the walls. I slept on it overnight.Here is how I did it:First, oil the shaft. Then first see if it is going to slide into the hinge without much friction. I was lucky because once I took the brass sleeve off it slipped in smoothly.Once you're sure it will slip in without much trouble, TAKE IT OUT FOR THE ADJUSTMENT. Don't even bother to try it their way.Once it's out and you're sitting comfortably, place the legs directly opposite of each other on the shaft. There will be no tension on the spring at this point. Then clamp the legs tight using Vice Grips so they won't slip out and rotate. Clamp them high up on the lowest leg so you don't torque anything out of whack when you tighten the Vice Grips down on the legs. Also, clamp them using the very end of the Vice Grips so you have as much clearance as you can get from the door.In my case I then just held the Vice Grips firmly between my knees (probably a better method exists) and turned the nut clockwise about 3/4 of a turn, then simply slid the pin into a slot to secure the tension (with the legs still clamped).Then since you've already established that the pin will slide into the hinge without much effort, just slide it in ALL THE WAY DOWN while the Vice Grips are still clamping the legs. Release the Vice Grips and you're done!In my case I only wanted the door to shut and not latch. If you want it to actually latch you're going to have to turn the nut further.Hope that helps.Warning: In my case I didn't require much closing power so there wasn't too much pressure required by the Vice Grips. To get a lot of closing power you'd probably want to have the legs held down with something more than a Vice Grip. You definitely don't want those legs coming loose with a lot of tension being applied by turning the nut further and further.

The negative reviews should be strongly considered before you roll the dice.In my case, after meticulously following the instructions, I found the correct circuits and tried them out. Was not happy at all. To get them to work you just had to have everything 'just so'.Meaning:They don't work through 'power strips'.They didn't work with anything else plugged into the other outlet of a standard wall outlet.If the outlet you have it plugged into is controlled by a light switch, it won't work after it's been turned off. It needs to be completely re-installed to work again.The few positive reviews you see here are probably a result of luck more than anything else.I like to take chances as much as anyone else and think "It'll work for me. Those people just didn't read the instructions." But in this case I'd just stay away from these units.

Thanks goodness I hadn't bought it without looking inside.After about 5 minutes of reading Chapter One I had the feeling I was reading somewhere in the middle of the book. None of what the author was saying made me think I was learning (or about to learn Sanskrit). There were just too many overly difficult sentences to follow. Really.The layout (if you could call it that) was nearly 90% text based, meaning its not broken up much at all with graphs, charts, progressive chaptering, or sidebars. Very user un-friendly, especially for a beginner.I haven't looked at the other recommendations but I am sure they would be far better than trying to start with this.
A1ABGTGJTCD6S9	1	1	It wouldn't install out of the package.What I did:1. Installed Far Cry onto an XP machine (32 bit). I ran it a few times though not sure that's required or helps.2. Copied the entire Crytek folder (3.2Gb) from the XP machine into Win 8's Program Files(x86) folder. It started but errored out as it couldn't find a file (msvcp71.dll) in the system32 folder.3. For 32 bit systems you need to add one file to the Windows/System32 folder (msvcp71.dll), for 64 bit systems you need to add two files (msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll) to the Windows/SysWOW64 folder.That was all it needed. You have to navigate to the farcry.exe file in the Bin32 folder to start the game. You also need to use the Compatibility Mode to have it run in XP/SP 3 mode and right click on it and start it as Administrator.You can find the one or two files you need to copy in a single file compressed format on the web. It is named "Msvcp71.dll AND Msvcr71.dll files", or you could find them separately. These are Microsoft C Runtime Library files which didn't get included in Win 7 or Win 8, it seems.Most of this info came from w w w addictivetips dot com. I don't use multiplayer so I don't know how it applies there. I also did all this to a clean version of the game...no patches or mods and no 64-bit patch either.Hope that helps.
A1ABN7XZ7KFC49	1	0	I have been comparing so many different models for over 2 months now. I was sold on the professional at Sams Club for just under $300 and noticed this one on a friday sale. I compared both models and called Kitchenaid to verify the models and motors, etc. It arrived today and I can honestly say it is better than I expected. Wow is all I can say

A1ABQRVVPMUQTB	1	1	I bought this for my 5 year old son and he LOVED it. Then his almost 4 year old sister started figting over it so we had to get her own cartridge. Now she is in preschool and when she took the PALS test she blew the scores for where she should be AT THE END OF THIS YEAR completely out of the water!!She knew all her capitals and lowercase and most of the sounds. This is an excellent educational toy!I wish that gameboys could disappear and be replaces with this!
A1ABQRVVPMUQTB	0	0	This is a total waste of money. My daughter received one for her 5th birthday and can't get it to bounce at all. She is 44 lbs, my 6 year old son couldn't get it to go either. I even had a hard time pushing it up and down trying to loosen it up a bit.I guess it seems well built enough but not designed for smaller kids very well.
A1ABQRVVPMUQTB	1	1	I've been lusting after a stand mixer with dough hooks, etc. for years. I have pointed them out to my husband and told him that was what I wanted for holidays, b'days, anniversary.......etc. NEVER GOT ONE!I ordered this one with some Amazong gift cards and an AMEX discount deal. I knew it was a KILLER deal and I was right!I have the black and love it. It looks great on my counter. It does the job beautifully and I have made more cookies, banana bread, etc. in the past 2 months than I had in the past year or longer.I did learn a lesson though........it can NOT handle a double batch of a banana bread very well. That was my fault for even trying it though.It is not a high power turbo mixer but has more power than your standard hand mixer.If you want a stand mixer but not sure how much you will use it this is a great way to try it out. Then you have an extra on hand for small jobs, extra cookie batches or to give to someonelse to try.AWESOME!!
A1AC0TFR2WPW5U	1	1	It is amazing how such a simple film can bring emotions from a depth that you never new existed within yourself. If only we all took the time to appreciate all of the simpler moments in our lives.Truly a must see movie! If not for the story, then for the music. But mainly, for both. This is the only way I can "review" this film. I think each person needs to see it and experience it themselves.
A1AC0TFR2WPW5U	0	0	This pillow really gave me the worst stiff neck and headache. I am glad it works for some people, but it seems that it is a very expensive lesson to find that it does not work for you!
A1AC0TFR2WPW5U	1	1	If you have ever been through a period of depression caused by trying to please everyone but yourself (haven't we all?) then you will relate to this book. It takes you through the downfall into depression and allows a path back to the surface. I fell upon this book at the perfect moment in my life. Hopefully, someone else will be able to experience the same.
A1ACC40BY0J3A6	0	1	Evidently the sensor area on this detector gets dirty very easily, and once it is dusty/dirty it's starts to beep. You can clean it out with canned air, but it's still annoying how unprotected the sensor area is.
A1ACC40BY0J3A6	1	1	I really like these. I have a 8 units put together in 2 rows (holding 32 bottles), and I'm having no problem with toppling or instability, and I keep my racks pretty full of wine. As another reviewer mentioned, the bottom row of wine will end up sitting directly on your floor or counter, but that wasn't a problem for my setup. I found them easy to put together (with plenty of clips for attachment), and these take up the least amount of space of any wine rack I've seen. The only downside to them (and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) is that while I appreciate the compact size, if they were just a teeny bit bigger, I could store all types of wine in them. I have squeezed some pinot noirs in (being careful not to push off one of the attachment clips), but some pinot noirs and all champagnes are too big.
A1ACC40BY0J3A6	1	1	This movie currently ranks #1 as my daughter's favorite Barbie movie, and it's one of her favorite movies overall. The storyline is cute and holds her attention, and the modern music (especially a remake of EMF's Unbelievable) has her dancing around the living room, much to my amusement. The parent in me likes that Barbie has friends with varied skin colors and talents (though of course one can criticize that they are all thin and beautiful), and the message that girls (or anyone, even the dreamer Prince) can do whatever they dream of doing is great. My daughter also noticed and commented that Barbie had a lot to learn from the older woman in the movie. I liked that Barbie recognizes the hypocrisy of the Prince in having his own dreams but denying the dreams of others, and in the end, Barbie is too busy foiling plots to kill the King to go off on a date:)Extras: there are bloopers which send my daughter into the giggles, and the video of the kitty singing Unbelievable is one of her favorites.Overall:While the plot is crazy and unrealistic, the movie is entertaining to a kid and provides a storyline that is age appropriate. Yes, it's a bit saccharine, but that's perfect for the target audience, and it is amusing enough to me to make it tolerable (which is good since this movie is requested all the time).
A1ACC40BY0J3A6	1	1	While the first Tinkerbell movie was to me acceptable, this one was actually enjoyable. Partly this could be because I am now used to thinking of Tinkerbell as not the Tinkerbell from Peter Pan, but a new Tink reinvented to make Disney some more money. However, this time around, I think they did such a good job that I was not annoyed with the makeover! My 6 yr old daughter also thought this movie was "the greatest" (her words). Although she liked the first one, she didn't want to watch it over and over and over. This one, she says, is one she wants to watch again and again, which means it may actually be worth adding to your collection. If you haven't seen the first movie, this movie can stand alone on it's own, which is always nice. Both Tink 1 and this movie have messages (accepting who you are, and accepting responsibility, respectively), but I think this Tink installment did a better job of incorporating the message into the story.Picture & Sound:On Blu-ray, the picture is beautiful; it's one of the movies that makes me just want to stare at my screen! The sound is 5.1 (instead of 7.1 as in some of the newer Blue-rays), and although it's not full of surround effects, it is well done, and most will enjoy the Celtic style music (brought back from the first) that accompanies most of the movie.Extras:The 16 mins of deleted scenes are not exciting for kids unless they are into the technical aspects of how movies are made (they are in storyboard format), but your little & tween girls will probably love the Demi Lovato song/video as mine did.Overall:This is a keeper and definitely worth buying as opposed to renting!
A1ACC40BY0J3A6	0	1	The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant.
A1ACQXJ53VVBV7	0	0	This movie isn't even out yet and already I'm sick. I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, I've read almost everything that has been published, and I cannot believe what people do to his work. The only "adaptation" that was of any value was "A Scanner Darkly", and I don't understand why it was made into animation. It did nothing for the story. Now we have another story "based on" a PKD story that has nothing to do with the original. If you want to know what this story is about, read "The Golden Man", and forget the movie. In fact I recommend the short story collection entitled "Second Variety" by Citadel Press. While you are at it, read Dick's comments on the story "The Golden Man" in the Notes at the back. It is a better use of your time than going to see the evisceration of another one of his excellent stories. I wonder where Dante would put the "writer" who adapted this one?
A1ACQXJ53VVBV7	0	0	Buyers, please be aware: this is not the Edward G Robinson, Ida Lupino film from 1941. This is, despite many deceptive indications not least of which is the vagueness of the distributors description, the 1993 version with Christopher Reeves. This version is not a very good movie, it screams of poorly funded made for TV all over it. In addition, the quality of the dvd-r is terrible. I have VHS movies recorded from TV that are far better in quality than this piece of plastic. Please do not purchase this poorly made, poorly distributed movie. Use your money to buy a much better movie to watch while we all wait for a release on dvd of the original 1941 film. I would recommend any film available with Edward G Robinson, or Ida Lupino, as an alternative.
A1ACQXJ53VVBV7	0	0	I regret I am unable to give this zero stars, and even that would be too complementary to a movie that was pure torture to watch. I watched the MST3K version of this film, so I had the benefit of hearing the wisecracks and jokes, and my daughter and I still decided it was the worst thing we had ever seen. The pace of the movie is excruciatingly slow, the plot...such as it was...could only be described as something extracted from a dull witted 3 year old, and the cinematography was horrid. Don't question how Satan and Santa end up on the screen together, rather rue the fact that someone thought it a good idea. If this movie was attempting to cater to the chronically depressed, then it succeeds towards that end, and if you don't happen to be a depressive you will be by the time the end of this movie finally drags into view. I apologize for not attempting a synopsis of the story, but I do occasionally suffer from depression myself, and I don't want to trigger another episode.At any rate, suffice it to say that a sentence is entirely too long to sum up the plot of this stinker anyway. Several people have commented that this movie is so bad that it is good, but I believe that it is so bad, it is horrible. My recommendation is to have a lobotomy, amputate a limb, drive nails into your skull, or paste yourself with honey and lay on an anthill before you subject yourself to the torment that is this film. That way it won't seem quite so bad...maybe.
A1ACWV319J92W4	0	1	I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. Please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year, choose something else. It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the "must buy for mom" list for the 2008 Christmas season.I very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did.
A1ACWV319J92W4	1	1	My wife and I are intelligent people. At least we like to think so. So when we read all the bad reviews of this movie around its release, we decided not to go see it.Mistake.This movie is fun, funny, and well-constructed. Sure, it's a dog movie, so there is some canine-related humor here, which seemed to send all the "film critics" off the deep end. Jason Lee has fun with this role and delivers all the best lines, spot-on perfectly. The plot is easy enough to follow and you can easilly skip the holes if you want to. They don't ruin the movie, but they are there. Again, "film critics" lost all track of the movie, seething over these small glitches.Oh, and there's an awesome remake of the Underdog theme song. Modern version. Enjoy it. :)I only regret not seeing this on the big screen. It's a darn funny movie and deserves better reviews.
A1ACWV319J92W4	1	1	Like many others, I grew up shooting film and nearly always bought Kodak products. When I started to get serious about turning my hobby into more than a hobby I started trying other films from other manufacturers. Agfa and Fuji were the two that I used most, but I pretty much stopped trying new color film when I came across this one. This film is AMAZING. I know of no other film that is as versatile, from weddings to landscapes, from portraits to still life, this film always delivers gorgeous color, nearly invisible grain, and excellent saturation without being overdone.That being said, this film shines brightest when professionally processed. Your typical Walmart or local drugstore *probably* won't do this film justice. Spend a few extra bucks, take it to a decent photo store, and be prepared to be stunned.Oh, and right now (June 2009), this film costs under $5 a roll. Don't pay more than that. There are plenty of online places that sell it for that price or less so don't get ripped off.
A1ACWV319J92W4	1	1	As of today, July 2009, there are a number of ASA 100 speed films on the market. Kodak has their Tmax100 and Plus-X, Ilford has their FP and Delta varieties, and Fuji offers Acros. I have tried them all but keep coming back to Acros as my main B&W; film. The two most outstanding characteristics this film displays are low-grain and excellent shadow/highlight range - dynamic range - which lets the film keep detail in the darker, shadowed areas without the brighter areas becoming overexposed blobs. This is a fine balancing act and this film does a great job of it. I especially recommend developing this film in Kodak's Xtol developer, with a 1+3 dilution. The film's sharpness is superb with this combination.The biggest drawback to this film is price. It usually sells for more than the Kodak or Ilford offerings, but it's worth the extra cost.
A1ACYVITCCCWBR	1	1	This clock has everything I want in a simple alarm clock, with one minor drawback (below). It takes up little space, has a large display, and removes the worry about electrical outages and DST. It also allows me to move the alarm setting backward in time (my previous digital clocks required that the alarm be run forward through a 24 hour cycle just to set the alarm time a few minutes earlier).The minor drawback is that the alarm function was a little difficult at first (I could have mitigated this by reading the directions, but that's no fun.) Specifically, the circular (!!) switch for the alarm is so small that I had trouble finding it, and it feels flimsy. It also took me a while to realize that the alarm time can be changed only when it is activated. After a day of use, familiarity removed these difficulties.Caveats:- I have not even turned the radio on, so I can't comment on that.- The estimated lifetime for the battery is only 250 days. My review may not be as charitable after the battery runs out and I have bought a new lithium battery.TWO YEAR UPDATE (July 2011):I'd give it only 2 Stars now.The battery is still going, so it's done far better than the 250 day estimate. However, the clock runs fast and the time setting function does not work. After two years, the clock is 15 minutes fast. I'm going to replace it and junk this one.SECOND UPDATE(June 2012: Back to 4 starsOops- user error. I figured out how to set the time, and the battery is still going strong almost 3 years later.
A1ACYVITCCCWBR	0	0	The book is actually neither science fiction nor fantasy. It's an historical novel. Although it's about a trip to the 14th century, I could imagine a similar story about a mission to any isolated place, even in our own time. That said, the idea of sending historians to the past makes a very interesting premise with all kinds of possible stories. The fact that the time travel process magically eliminates any acts which could alter history is obviously absurd, but it at least allows the author to avoid such issues.However, the achievement falls far short of the possibility. There's essentially no plot- a young researcher (Kivrin) in 2050 is accidentally sent to the year of the Black Death by a technician ill with the flu. The reader knows this before he even opens the book, thanks to the summary on the flyleaf. However, it takes almost 300 pages before anyone involved in the story knows it. I found myself skimming large portions hoping I would get to something interesting. This could have a very good book if the page count were cut in half.In the interim, the author plagues us (pun intended) with a set of characters (Gilcrist, Mrs. Gaddson, the American bell ringers, Finch,...) who are annoying caricatures and who are ultimately irrelevant to the story. All of these, plus even the main characters, plod around for 400 pages or so doing trivial, irrational and contradictory things. Kivrin and Colin (the pre-teen forced to spend Christmas with Mr. Dunworthy) are the only modern characters who seem human.The science of the future world is absurd. It has video phones but no cell phones (even when Ms. Willis wrote this book there were cell phones) and almost no other useful technologies. Even ones that exist are ignored. For example, more than half Kivrin's story is taken up with her vain attempts to re-find the drop location, but it turns out that she could have simply taken a "locator" device with her.The last 150 or so pages contain whatever plot exists and are somewhat more interesting. However, I found the conclusion quite unsatisfactory. The author kills off almost everyone and the story just tails off.Even with all the above, my feelings are a bit ambiguous. Ms. Willis' command of the language is good, which is a rare quality. Any short excerpt from the book reads well- it's the cumulative effect of boring characters and inaction that bother me. I enjoyed some of Kivrin's story and most of the characters in 1348, although I'm skeptical of the historical accuracy of many of the descriptions. The 14th century sounds too much like farm life as described by my grandparents in the rural south.
A1ACYVITCCCWBR	0	0	This toaster is easy to clean out and looks great. However, it has some problems:1. Although the sides remain cool to the touch throughout the toasting process, the metal top gets extremely hot. A couple of times I've had to extract bread by hand, and have been burned twice.2. Even on the lowest setting, it overdoes my toast. I have to stand by and terminate the process manually to keep bread from getting overdone. I haven't even tried on settings of 2 or higher.3. It has a light which is on any time the toaster is plugged in. I find this annoying, since it conveys no useful information. I find myself unplugging the toaster just to get rid of the light.I would not buy it again, and I may even replace it at some point. Too bad, because I like its looks and its versatility in handling bagels, bread and other items to be toasted.
A1ACYVITCCCWBR	1	1	My oldest granddaughter (7) checked this book out of the library and asked me to read it to her and her sister. It's the most fun I've ever had reading! Skippyjon is the cutest. most outrageous character ever; the illustrations fit the story perfectly; and the rhyming combinations of real and made-up words are hilarious. Both girls loved it and went off to read it themselves. We'll be getting more Skippyjon stories.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	0	1	Phoenix Mourning open their debut with a scream and some edge but, as most screamo bands these days, are unable to make it standup. The opening track ""Across Twenty-Six Winters"" is the epitome of what this genre has quickly become: derivative, unoriginal and lifeless. This band may put on a great live show but they fail to impress on the album.With ideas culled from sources like As I Lay Dying, Underoath and Emery, they merge the gruff guttural vocals of classic Zao with the poppy/intense tone of Thursday. The problem is that all of those bands did it much better in every way possible. The only reason this band is on Metal Blade is because they needed a marketing answer to the aforementioned bands. Well, they found it. This band is as cookie cutter as it gets and I'm sure the kids will buy into it if they can land them on the right bill. The shame of this entire thing is that they're very talented and could have given us an album with original music, instead its retread The Changing of Times mixed with some more aggressive lead work, which is the only high point on this disc. With Underoath about to release a smash of an album, why not steal a page and try to cash in?The band does manage to put together a decent song here and there; the catchy and well written ""From Afar"" with its intricate guitar work and ""Waiting for The King"" which has a nice chorus that reminds me of Morningside Drive and a great outro.Lacking the tremendous hooks of their brethren won't stop this band, they'll be able to sell just on the basic sound. Thank you for polluting our airwaves with more of the same.For Fans of: Underoath, Dryline, Emery
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Dropping names like it's their business) the write-up for this band includes Beloved, Thursday, The Bled and Refused) Burden of a Day has created a lot of hype around their Blood&Ink; Records debut. Hype or not, does the record pay any dividends?Yes.This is high quality screamo. Taking lead tones from Thrice, the verse style of Underoath and the occasional atmospheric outro section of Beloved, this band have got it together. Even the drumming reminds me of Joe Musten. Despite the genre being oversaturated with this style of music, if its high quality, I'll listen!"Escapism as an Art Form" will appeal to any fan of the screamo genre. This song just sticks with you--catchy, great leads all throughout and the combination of scream/sing vocals work very well here."No Blood No Foul" is another killer song that fits in with the aggressive end of screamo and a great breakdown that'll have you flailing along. I enjoy the added violin work in this song as well--this is something that these bands aren't doing much of and I'd like to see it more!Every track on this album ends up being a solid piece of screamo work. What are the down points? As per usual, the disc isn't breaking any new ground. It pretty much does what you expect it to do for a screamo disc... but what a great job it does! The gruff vocals sound like The Bled and the clean vocals in most of the songs sound exactly like Adam Lazzara from Taking Back Sunday.Take Underoath, Taking Back Sunday and The Bled and smash them together. That's what you've got. Take that as you will, but I'll take it and rock the hell out thank you!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	The write-up on this band that I received says that they were formed due to Tobias Buck's interest in hardcore and Swedish death metal. I think that just about wraps up everything there is to say about this band because they basically accomplish what they set out to do.The band avoids one of the biggest clich&eacute;s in hardcore with the stereotypical halftime/beatdown breakdown. There's nothing wrong with it every once in awhile, but come on. It's tired. "God-Forsaken Soil" is one of the few songs that showcases a section like that, but they are quickly forgiven by embracing early Amon Amarth as a secondary influence instead of In Flames, Soilwork and At The Gates like every other band breaking into this genre (though you'll still hear some of it). The song moves like Once Sent From the Golden Hall.Sebastian Heldt plays a few blast beats on the album and you can tell that he very easily could have done it most of the album; their enjoyment of grindcore is evident. ""Heavenhell"" has tremendous groove oriented riffs that break into grind and death sections like it's their business. This song is both brutal and melodic without ever losing a sense of what it really is; a death metal song.While I would suggest this to fans of Amon Amarth, be forewarned, this album isn't straight double bass-- that have lots of groove and their riffs have a healthy amount of Killswitch Engage influence.For Fans of: Amon Amarth, Soilwork, Killswitch Engage
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	0	1	After years of waiting die-hard Aiden fans finally get there wish with the rerelease of Our Gangs Dark Oath, their album released prior to being signed to Victory Records. What will this album show us that their debut Victory album didn't? Well, nothing.If you're under the impression that this band was somehow better prior to being inked to Victory you would be sadly mistaken--they still lack an original bone in their bodies and just happen to be riding a high wave that bands like AFI and Thrice abandoned in order to mature.Surprisingly enough, the vocals on this album are actually better than those on Nightmare Anatomy. Standard upbeat tempo's and screamed (struggling screams really) verses during ""I Set My Friends on Fire"" set the tone for this album. Aggressive in the most pop sense of the word, intense in the over-dramatic HIM style and just enough whine to appeal to the 12-15 year old emo kid. There isn't much to say about this album. If you liked their first disc, you'll probably like this... if you hated the first album, take heart, this album is pretty much the same thing.For Fans of: Thrice, AFI, My Chemical Romance
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Thebleedingalarm, always spelt in lowercase with all three words mashed together, are a five piece rock band out of Canada that just recently signed to Immortal Records. Apparently the demo was so good that the label decided not to make any changes to it; just repackage and release it as the bands debut album.Though not quite as good as Immortal would have you believe, thebleedingalarm have some promise. They're emo in the same sense that Moments in Grace are, they have a large emo appeal but I wouldn't go about tossing them right in the genre. Their leads remind me of Alexisonfire's Watch Out!which is nice to hear since not many bands are using that type of jerky/multi note lead work.The disc itself really starts to shake about half-way through with the song ""Amber in Ashes."" This track exemplifies strong screamo and propels the rest of this album forward. It's a shame the first half isn't as good as the proceeding songs... ""Sorrows the Seas of my Heart"" is chock full of wonderful melody and the title track is a true monster, filled with desperation and anguish.All in all, for most people, this album will probably get tossed into the "typical screamo" corner and never get listened to again. I hear a little more melody in some of this bands songs and their hooks are pretty tight so I hear a world of potential. Instead of re-releasing this album, I would have had the band go back into the studio and work on an entirely new album--I hear maturity, but I know that a second album from this band would have produced much better results in the same way that Alexisonfire's second album is far superior to their debut.If you're down with screamo that has strong melodies, this is for you. Just don't think you're buying the next Too Bad You're Beautiful.For Fans of: Alexisonfire, From Autumn to Ashes, Brand New
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Junior Varsity's re-release of their debut album, The Great Compromise, probably marks a good chance for the band to further distance themselves from their older material and really move forward. An album that has been sought by diehard fans for awhile, Victory Records finally decided to cash in and release this album as a deluxe edition full with DVD and bonus tracks.The good news for JV fans is that what they're getting out of the deal is just another great disc that they probably don't own already. The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs as well as notes from the members of the band about each song. Featuring the emotive ""Park Your Car"" (which was apparently one of the first songs ever written by the band, and one of their best) and ""Left Foot Right Foot"" which has a The Running EP Beloved sort of feel minus the screaming--the album has a nice variety of pure pop-punk and emo-rock that makes them both accessible and identifiable.Vocalist Asa Dawson slides in and out of tune seamlessly which, to most ears would making him sound amateurish but to these ears makes him even easier to identify with as he sings lyrics like Lost but not forgotten, down but far from out/ I could use a change of key while his lower range reminds me of Thomas Barnett from Strike Anywhere.This album should easily find its way onto anyone's shelf that is into early Juliana Theory, early Get Up Kids or The Ataris. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	An excellent CD from an excellent human being! I bought this CD in December at a show I saw him at and was not disappointed at all. Dallman has a very unique voice that is full of character... it has an almost Irish feel to it but without going overboard. The disc a collection of acoustic based folk/light rock songs that never get heavy and never grow tiresome due to the excellent hooks and melodies that Dallman crafts. If you get the chance to purchase or see him, please do so, you wont regret it! To be honest with you, I don't listen to this genre of music to often so I'm not sure as to whom I should compare him to... so just go to www.myspace.com/christopherdallman and listen for youself.Highlights:This is CalmNighttime in the CityDriving to You
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Finally, a pop-punk band that released an entire disc worth of great material aside from one or two singles and three or four other solid tracks. The Audition have put together what I would call a masterpiece of pop-punk if I were prone to using that word to describe pop-punk albums. This disc is so hook filled and sing-along friendly that it's hard to not move your body and bop your head while the songs play.While not sounding exactly like Fall Out Boy, the resemblance is obvious. You will probably like this band if you like Fall Out Boy but I wont guarantee that you will like Fall Out Boy if you like The Audition. The Audition isn't quite as aggressive and fall more in the rock genre then the punk genre of their pop-punk mentality, but there's not a damn thing wrong with that!Highlights:"Approach the Bench""The Ultimate Cover Up"
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	There are no frills on The Juliana Theory's fourth and final full-length, Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat. I wont go into the horror story of getting this album released and the hell this band had endured throughout their careers... it's all water under the bridge now because the band is defunct. That pain is washed away for most of us with the realization that we need to accept what we've been given and cherish it.I'm a long time fan of this band and will have to review this album as such... with my feelings in the past and my eyes on the present offering. What is Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat? After the release of Love, which was a critical flop for the band, (sadly since I think the disc, at that point, was their most mature offering) how was The Juliana Theory supposed to follow that album up?The same way they followed up each album: evolving their sound.Always ahead of the curve, doing emo before emo really existed on most people's radar and than abandoning emo for rock before every other band would start doing it, The Juliana Theory continued their evolution of music. Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat does a great job of melding the solid rock foundations of Love (""We Make The Road By Walking"") with the sarcastic/bitter elements of Emotion is Dead (Shotgun Serenade) without rehashing a single song... each piece is a unique part of The Juliana Theory's story. ""Leaves Like a Ghost"" is a driving track that bleeds with immediacy and might be the best representation of the band. This band is not about baseless hope, they contain the seeds to dig into emotions that go far beyond--the lyrical imagery on this disc is not that far off where Emotion is Dead was at. Don't buy this disc thinking you're getting an album full of uplifting love songs, you're getting a human beings worth of love, heartache, devastation and even a little redemption. This is, in my opinion, is the masterpiece The Juliana Theory always worked towards.Pretty much the forerunner for every popular emo/indie band going right now that has come out in the past 5 years, The Juliana Theory never received the credit they deserved during their existence... here's to hoping people will give them the respect they deserve in death.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Soundscapes of atmospheric rock. The opening track to Faulter's Darling Bud's of May will have new 30 Seconds to Mars fans standing on their seats screaming the anthemic chorus and swaying in slow unison to this melancholic burner. Not to sit on their hands for too long, Faulter kicks it into pop rock high gear for "I Think We Need to Talk" by channeling the spirit of Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World and the vaguely reminiscent Jimmy Eat Worldesque "October 16th." This may be one of the first discs where the promotional material that came with it actually nailed what this band sounded like. The tightness of their sound is only helped by the drumming of Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle/Nine Inch Nails) but to be honest, these kids can write a good song even if they're not leaving the box to do it. Don't sleep on them but don't take them for more than they are!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Virtuoso playing on a disc could never be enough to give a progressive metal album 5 stars because, quite frankly, almost all progressive metal musicians are top notch! Dali's Dilemma manages to craft hooks within each song while holding onto the tempo changes and keyboard/guitar solos.The band draws readily made comparisons to Dream Theater, but if you've had this album for as long as I've had it and listened close enough, you'll know that these comparisons, while justified, are hardly the tip of the iceberg. Matt Gulliory's keyboard work hints at "Awake" but otherwise has a unique blend that will draw in past Kevin Moore fans and allow others to discover a new side to prog.The pieces on this album are truly songs--staying true to structure and allowing the non-musician to grasp onto the choral hooks sung by the excellent Matthew Bradley. Matthew's voice is one of the best I've heard in this genre as he explores his upper range but never goes overboard. If only he had done more work aside from a guest appearance in Explorer's Club.Songs to pay close attention to are "Within a Stare" with its opening keyboard loop, "Miracles in Yesteryear" with its falsetto chorus, "Whispers" showing off the atmospheric beauty of Matt Gulliory and "Living in Fear"... where the whole band comes together for a monster opus that closes out the album perfectly. Highly recommended prog metal that doesn't get the credit it deserves!For Fans of: Dream Theater, Lemur voice, Mullmuzzler
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	0	0	Homeland Insecurity opens with up-tempo drumming and deep growls that feel like they head absolutely no where. The song is a wash of boredom with almost no diversions from the standard metalcore triplets and palm muted chords underneath and sadly, this album doesn't stray too far form the formula after that.The clean singing on this album is solid and some of the lead work during the choruses (""A Taste of Everest"") is solid but the band just never does anything new which seems to be a growing trend amongst Victory bands.If you've heard Still Remains, Silverstein or It Dies Today... you've pretty much heard everything this band has to offer now, sadly.To be honest, had they stayed mostly in the direction of their single ""Single and Loving It"" the disc would have been much more enjoyable! Otherwise, you can pass on this one!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Moros Eros' I Saw the Devil Last Night And Now The Sun Shines Bright is odd. The album brings together rock, pop and dance the way Head Automatica did on Decadence: with a blatant disregard for genre.Driven by thick bass lines and vocals that bob and weave between being Robert Smith, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, and maybe even a little Brandon Flowers from The Killers--this band combines hand claps, synth pop and dissonant chord progressions to create what is mildly danceable and wholy entertaining.This band's song do not lay claim to one singular style or feel as they branch out and cover as much as they can within the standard song structure though the aforementioned singers would also be the first place I'd point to as an influence with more of a garage sound than any of them.Highly recommended to those you ready to throw caution to the wind and take a chacne on a band that actually has a new sound. Do not buy this if you want the straight forward and normal!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Is it any surprise that a band that seems to have fashioned themselves after Underoath are being produced by Matt Goldman (of Underoath fame)? Let Your Body Take Over manages to find the small niche that Underoath missed; the progression from They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line.Four Letter Lie combines the guitar heavy tone of Define the Great Line (""Full Tilt Boogie"") with the pop hooks (""Naked Girl Avalanche"") that TOCS was filled with. But don't be fooled, Underoath isn't the only band that these guys are borrowing from thought as it's hard to hear ""Feel Like Fame"" and not pick up a Fall Out Boy vibe.It's almost impossible at this point to invent anything new in the screamo genre and most bands realize that. Bands are refining their sound as opposed to redefining it and with some bands that works just fine. Four Letter Lie falls soundly in that category--they're not doing anything new and probably wont do anything new in the future--but what they do is high grade pop screamo at it's very best!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Pain of Salvation are back with what appears to be the most controversial album of their careers, Scarsick. What makes Scarsick a different album? Texture and sound--PoS have removed everything that's pretty and accented the ugly. Lyrically speaking the album is a commentary on the United States--a cynical view. Simulating the voice of the culture (""Spitfall"") while also embracing their rich Mike Patton influence with the Mr. Bungle infused ""Disco Queen,"" PoS continue to evolve in their sound. While featuring Daniel at his most socially conscious it also features the most rapping he's done on any album too date. Less harmonies, less complication and more anger then any other disc, Scarsick represents a growing reaction to the projection that Americans have gone out of their way to create for the world; we are spoiled and shut in living within ourselves. Though would it be unfair to say that most people in the world do the same?Outside of Mr. Bungle, PoS have, again, buried their influences in Daniel's unique capabilities. While maintaining the signature PoS quirkiness, they have expanded their sound by incorporating simpler musical sections and rhythms that remind me of KoRn (""Idiocracy,"" ""Flame to the Moth""). Their in, though, lives the power of the album. Stripped down and naked, blunt and efficient--Daniel has eschewed metaphor and replaced it with what he feels Americans should understand; awkward overstated honesty. This honesty is only awkward though because it's unlike him. The lyrics could be considered the trite musings on the sociopolitical state we find ourselves, but the past must be taken into account when judging the future, so we know the elementary level of his lyrics form a purposeful relationship with an album that might represent the least musically progressive, but most divisive, in the PoS catalogue. Saying the album is progressive may throw listeners off in many respects. The album is not chock full of time changes and odd meter; it's progressive in the truest sense of the word, as Pain of Salvation always has been.From the aggressive opener ""Scarsick"" to the Zepplinesque closer ""Enter Rain"" the band show all of it's influences without ever losing their originality. Forget the pretty, forget the time changes, embrace the complicated dressed as simplicity in the form of Scarsick!
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Before I had received this album to review I had already added it to my list of CDs that I needed to purchase. I had seen a full page ad in the latest AP and listened to a few tracks on their PureVolume site and after one listen, knew I needed to own all of their discs. The following week, I received their SolidState debut to review. To say I was pleased would be an understatement.So what is Life in Your Way? Waking Giants makes it's statement with the opener, ""Reach the End"" which fuses all of the best elements of the screamo genre and, in particular, the SolidState label: Aggressive riffing, atmospheric leads and excellent clean vocals!All of the songs seem to have a quiet dignity about them, moving in and out of melody and chaos with ease. The clean complimenting the guttural screams wonderfully while the always atmospheric and moving leads dance seamlessly underneath the vocals. The album, as a whole, doesn't display the diversity that Failure On does, but it's powerful in its incessant attack in the Beloved(us) way. LiYW also use the spoken word section that a few bands such as Shai Hulud and Poison the Well made popular in the late 90's, early 2000's.For highlights of the album, listen to the middle section of "We Don't Believe." The pleading vocals that go against a building backdrop until it crescendos into an explosion of emotion and pleading. The song sums up the album: Powerful and reflective.Another highlight on the disc is "The Shame" where the band uses their fantastic lead work to compliment driving guitars. The song just moves and pushes forward with the same intensity that Underoath does.It's important to note that the clean singing on this album is much less emo then one might expect. It's a nice change of pace as only a few bands in the genre have singers that aren't completely whiney.It's early in 2007 but this is my album of the year front-runner right now. Beautiful, chaotic, and powerful--Life in Your Way has crafted a disc that fits into the small niche that Beloved(us) created.Highly recommended for fans of: Beloved(us), Hopesfall, Underoath
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Achilles presents us with a nice change of pace to the mathcore scene by not being obnoxiously heavy and, well, by not being overly mathy. The vocals on the album are very reminiscent of old Boy Sets Fire (the screaming vocals) which could place these guys very firmly in the old school screamo category. Before screamo was about being whiney and faux-punk--Achilles is a good representation of that sound. They're guitar tones are dirty and sometimes sloppy but, on purpose. They're aiming to create that tone and in doing so avoid falling into the bloated metalcore/technical hardcore genre.This band isn't trying to be over the top heavy and they're not trying to impress you with their technique (though their technique is quiet excellent as evidenced in ""to The Teeth""); they're writing songs that are catchy and emotional without all that bleeding vagina, "you broke my heart now I'll slit my wrists," you're used to.You'll have to be into punk to enjoy this and you'll have to be able to endure the old school hardcore vocals but the payoff is huge.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	0	0	As the first notes of ""Shakes in Your Mouth"" and ""Say Goodbye"" wrong through my speakers, there's one band that comes to mind immediately: As I Lay Dying. These guys are performing a style of Gothenburg hardcore made famous over here in the States by As I Lay Dying. In fact, it would be tough to say that there is much of anything separating the two bands save the few thousand miles between Australia and America.Slow beatdown sections, fast paced Gothenburg riffs that sound eerily like In Flames/At The Gates b-sides and clean vocals that tie back to the aforementioned As I Lay Dying sum up what this band is about. It gets so bad that ""The Deepest Sleep"" sounds like it could be a cover of an As I Lay Dying song.Skip it.For Fans of: As I Lay Dying, In Flames, Killswitch Engage
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	It takes a lot nowadays to release an impressive metalcore album. That may be one reason why Hopesfall decided to leave that genre behind with the release of A Types a few years ago and began the change to an excellent post-rock/post-hardcore band that could sit comfortably on a shelf between the Deftones and Dredg.Magnetic North takes the focus of A Types and continues the evolution of sound into a hybrid of music ranging from the Catch Without Arms inspired ""Secondhand Surgery"" to the White Pony laden ""The Canon"" and the altogether amazing ""Swamp Kittens"" which may be the highlight of the disc! Despite the influence the album is infused with a raw original sound that is altogether Hopesfall--the rough vocals that stagger screams in choice spots and the occasional use of dissonance. Elements of The Satellite Years can be heard in some of the more atmospheric sections which make it hard to forget the distinctive brand of Cave-In style postcore these boys were putting out several years back.Hopesfall have done an excellent job following up A Types without letting go of the sound that pushed them towards making that album. If you enjoyed A Types, you should love this album. If you preferred their older material, tread with caution. Hopesfall are helping to usher in the new direction of post-hardcore that finds itself leaning towards the more atmospheric California rock sound.Highly Recommended--possible album of the year!For Fans of: Deftones (White Pony/Saturday Night Wrist), Dredg, Cave-In (Jupiter/Antenna)
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Progressive metal should always embody the word progress: to change, to develop, and to evolve. Sometimes this evolution can cause a rift amongst a bands main fan base--forcing them to choose between several incarnations and sounds the band has adopted throughout their existence. Other times, the band carries their fan base along with them as their progression is more natural and expected. Wolverine feels like they fall squarely in the later category."Still" finds the band moving into more progressive rock territory but still managing to capture the aggressive elements of their past two albums. To label the band prog-rock, though, would be as misleading as calling Dream Theater's "Awake" prog-rock. Wolverine's own background seems to work against them when it comes to labels as they come from a Progressive/Death Metal background--so anything not in that mold will sound much lighter to any fans ears.The album has a collective feel of all the best bands around at their best moments but mashed together in an original form that only a band of Wolverine's caliber could manage. You can hear Dream Theater era "Awake" in a lot of the keyboard work (note the outro to "She Slowly Dies," or the keyboard intensity of "This Cold Heart of Mine"), Porcupine Tree harmonies (""Taste of Sand""), and Pink Floyd all over the disc. The riff that kicks ""A House of Plague"" off is the best riff Opeth never wrote. The melancholic sense of despair is pure Anathema, though, with a sense of urgency they haven't been able to match since "Eternity."The album is desperate and quiet with its Rhodes keyboard tones (""Nothing More""") and aggressive and belligerent with its riffs and samples (""Liar on the Mount""). The pulsing electronic groove of "Sleepy Town"" helps make the second half the disc even stronger then the first--closing with the powerful ""This Cold Heart of Mine"" with its driving keyboard atmosphere, and the epic ""And She Slowly Dies"" which has one of the most powerful choruses written by a prog group in recent memory.Stefan Zell is one of the most compelling vocalists in the business right now. His ability to draw emotion from each word he sings pulls the listener deeper into the song, going beyond great riffs and technical chops. Zell, compared to samples I've heard from previous albums, sounds like he has just gotten better and better--"Still" being his unofficial coming out party into the world of top vocalists.If you're into "Awake" era Dream Theater, mid era Anathema ("Eternity," "Alternative 4") and newer Porcupine Tree, this album is perfect for you. Dark, brooding and reflective with an intense edge, Wolverine has managed to create a masterpiece of modern progressive metal, in the truest sense of the genre label.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	If combining the bombastic keyboard mentality of Nightwish and Scholomance into a progressive death metal outfit were easy, there'd be more bands then Skyfire doing it. Skyfire's take on death metal will find many friendly ears amongst the Soilwork fans hoping for a return to the more brutal and even amongst a few Cradle fans, though they're not as brutal as Scholomance or Cradle, they mostly resemble the technicality of mid-early period Soilwork. Joakim Karlsson's vocals are dry and raspy with no clean vocals mixed in. The songs are carried by thick keyboard passages but allow enough room in the production for the fast paced riffing to cut through. In short, the band is punishing but melodic as well without giving into the melodic vocals so many of their brethren have done. Short blast beat bursts and groove driven sections are abound in this bands third full length release.This is an excellent progressive death metal release for fans that aren't afraid of keyboards!For fans of: Nightwish, Scholomance, Soilwork
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	A combination of melodic sections driven by keyboards and clean soloing and straight-ahead thrash, Omnium Gatherum run the gamut of metal. The first full track ""Into Sea"" covers all of the ground that the band claims to pay homage to in their bio: At the Gates, Katatonia, Death and even Judas Priest. You can hear the vintage tone in the riffing.The band uses some electronic elements (the breakdown in ""Into Sea,"" the opening to ""Dysnomia"") while staying true to their death metal roots. You have to appreciate the dynamics in the way the songs are structured, some driven by the keyboard, others by riffing and still others, a great combination of the two! There are actually sections of songs that remind me of Devin Townsend while others go into straight thrash and death. There are too many highlights to even mention them all! Each song does something that would need to be mentioned in the review.Incredible solo's, monster riffs, wicked keyboard atmosphere and some interesting electronic elements make this album a must hear for any fan of melodic death metal! The only detraction on this album is the vocals. While guttural, barking vocals are acceptable within the genre... these are just not very good. To be fair though, any fan of the genre will easily see past them as the music is excellent and worthy of attention. I can't stress enough how good the solos are on this disc. This is yet another consideration for album of the year!For Fans of: At The Gates, Death and Insomnium
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Wow.That was the first word that I could say when the opening track for Darkest Hour's fifth true full length kicked off. If "Doomsayer" isn't the closest thing to classic In Flames that's been released since the birth of metalcore, I don't know what is. Opening with acoustic guitar work that explodes into a mid-paced drum groove with shades of Gothenburg leads underneath, the song quickly becomes a straight In Flames cut when they kick it into overdrive. The lead work is strong and the growls are true. No melodic sing-song chorus here, just brutality. From the melodic breakdown to the syncopated rhythm section that lead into an excellent solo, the song is trademark In Flames and, despite all of that, is actually quite good.The opening track gives you a good idea of what Deliver Us is all about. Darkest Hour has grown as a band through the years and I believe are beginning to reach their full level of maturity with this disc. The Gothenburg influences have become their sound yet, they manage to remain unrelenting in their crushing riffs and speed. I have to give credit to John Henry for limiting his melodic vocal approach on the disc in a time when everyone in this scene is singing every chorus (including In Flames!). I wouldn't mind seeing him back off even more though and let the music do all of the talking though. This style of music has always been about the guitar work."Doomsayer" is followed by a short burst of energy called "Sanctuary" which has a brief glimpse of a melody in the vocals but is buried quickly. "Demon(s)" then kicks in and that pure Gothenburg sound returns. The lead that takes over after the breakdown isn't cheese laden, like most metalcore, but powerful and emotive. This album is truly a testament to the influence that those classic bands have had on modern metal.Henry's guttural vocals, in spots, recall Devin Townsend which may be due to his productionThe strength of this band is found when they allow themselves to explore in their longer songs. When they have time to flesh out a melody or lead into a new section, the songs truly breathe and emote what they're looking for. Where "Stand and Receive Your Judgment" fails, the epic feeling "Tunguska" succeeds in spades. Pay attention to the breakdown whose progression shows hints of Opeth. "A Paradox with Flies" is another strong track while "The Light at the Edge of the World" is both thoughtful and brief."Full Imperial Collapse" may be the only miss on the album and that's only because it leaves behind the Gothenburg mold for a more EveryTimeIDie style of dirty hardcore. It's not a terrible song but it doesn't fit the sound of the album.If you're looking for an album that is a return to 1995, this is the disc for you. Don't be misled of confused; this is metal with hardcore influence, not the other way around. Despite the fact that the album leans heavily toward the Gothenburg sound and borrows from early In Flames--the song writing is incredibly tight and leads are delicious.For Fans of: In Flames, At The Gates, Arch Enemy
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Mesmerizing. Atmospheric. Challenging. Intuitive. Epic.Those are words I would use to describe Irepress, a highly progressive instrumental metal band from Massachusetts. With thick layers of distortion and intricate guitar leads that tug at your mind while allowing you to slip deeper and deeper into the oblivion of a perceived white noise until you're rudely awakened by the melody of a changing theme, Irepress have managed to walk the line between genius and car crash and come out on the other side with an incredible album in their hands and in our ears.An album of this magnitude can be overwhelming because the band is challenging the mindset of music in the same way Explosions in the Sky are. Long winding passages of instrumental melody that are attacked with intricate riffing that can leave as quickly as it they've come.Instead of straight droning Irepress explores the dynamics of the guitar and allows new life to breathe within them--harkening newer Deftones and the explosive, yet temperamental nature of Saturday Night Wrist. The delay riddled leads that fill space along with palm muted triplet riffs underneath create enough metallic edge to keep technical metal heads glued to their seats but the band is quirky. They use dissonance, feedback and ambiance to keep everyone else interested. You can hear the Sigur Ros as much as the Meshuggah, but its Sigur with balls and Meshuggah with a more dynamic, experimental sound. Very California rock.The songs should be taken in as a whole and listened to the same way you'd listen to a classical piece; with an undivided attention to detail. DiNapoli and Silverberg will get the credit they deserve in ten years when people look back on this disc the same way people now look at Isis as one of the land marks of modern metal. They've crafted a modern work of art here.The ambient twists and metallic turns of this forty five minute opus should keep any progressive metal head guessing, any technical metal head thinking and any lover of music enthralled.This is my album of the year right now, no one comes even close.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	0	The Destro are a metalcore band (despite what their press release would have us believe) that follows in the Unearth/Blood Has Been Shed direction. Their press release compares them to Napalm Death, Pantera and, Lamb of God.I sort of hear it and kind of get it. The Destro fashion themselves very directly after southern metal legends, Pantera on this disc. You can hear the Phil Anselmo like screams and Abbot percussion in the chorus to "'Beast Burden," which sounds like it was taken from Pantera's ""Slaughtered"" off of Far Beyond Driven, or the overall Pantera sound in ""Knife in Hand."" The disc has a definitive southern metal swagger to it that, in this reviewers opinion, helps lift it a notch above the normal metalcore out there today.The highlight of the disc is a sprawling nine minute instrumental that closes out the album called "Forever Embedded." This song doesn't drift too often into the southern metal style and stays rather atmospheric in its style--almost post hardcore to some extent but still, it's a slow burning, groove driven metal piece.While many bands in this scene have been borrowing and taking a queue from Pantera for years, The Destro sound like they fill a niche that no one else is taking the gauntlet up for yet.
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	Henrik Flyman, of Wuthering Heights fame, formed Evil Masquerade in the summer of 2003. The band had released two relatively well received albums prior to Third Act but, with the addition of vocalist Apollo Papathansio (Time Requiem, Majestic), they now have their sights set on world wide acclaim.The first real track of the CD, "Third Act," is a fast paced power metal track that combines the Dio influence of Papathansio with the speed of contemporary metal acts such as Labyrinth, Rhapsody and even a bit of old school Kamelot. This track leads into the Merciful Fate inspired "Black Ravens Cry." If you can't hear "The Bell Witch" in this song, you're not a MF fan! Homage aside, this is a mid-tempo rocker with Papathansio doing his best mid range Dio meets upper register Warrel Dane. Flyman let's the chops go on this one and unleashes a solo that duels with a keyboard solo that sounds like it could belong to an uncredited Richard Andersson (Andersson is credited with being on the song "Third Act," not "Black Raven's Cry").The album continues much in this way. The album has a solid European power metal sound that continues with "Descended from the Grave," which then gives way to the burning rocker "Far Away," that not only displays Papathansio at his best but, showcases the bands best song writing yet! The riff that holds the song together will have any metal fan throwing their hand to the sky.There aren't many surprises on the album (if you ignore the slightly off and not very good "Under the Surface of Water"). The musicianship is as tight as you'd expect from any power metal band though Buhl does a few more interesting things on the disc that a lot of standard power metal drummers might not do. Andersson doesn't distract too much from the songs he contributes to and Flyman's licks are quite delicious for the genre. Evil Masquerade also manage to avoid falling into the galloping riff style of a lot of power metal bands which is a nice change of pace. In fact, they shine on the slower/mid tempo metal songs they do ("I'll Make you Burn").While I wouldn't call the band progressive or incredibly original, I would say that they offer a refreshing breath of air in a genre that has grown stale over the years.For Fans of: Labyrinth, Elegy, Mercyful Fate, Dio
A1AD05HC4T5WUP	1	1	I remember ordering this disc when it originally came out in 1998 from laserCD. That may make me officially old, I'm not sure. The disc is only nine years old and I guess a re-release and remaster was necessary? Either way, here we are.Remastered for our listening pleasure, Edlritch's El Nino is thicker and darker then before. The eerie/dry keyboard synths of "No Direction Home," actually remind me of Vitalji Kuprij's work in Artension which was something I might not have picked up on ten years ago. Terrence Holler's voice isn't quite as grating as it used to be either. His normal timbre has a more shrill tone to it then most singers in the progressive/power metal genre. A lot more edge then I was used to in '98 but, not now.Simone guitar work is pretty killer. His riffs are very aggressive and, considering how heavy the progressive metal genre has gotten through the years, this disc would sit comfortably next to them still. I would compare this disc's aggression and sound to a combination of Dream Theater's "Awake" and Artension's "Phoenix Rising" though Eldritch does manage to mix in other elements that these bands do not such as the electronic loops found in "Scar."None of this does anything though to temper the 80's overtones throughout the disc which have always been an issue for nineties power and progressive metal. Eldritch aren't as guilty of it as Angel Dust or Savatage but, if you can't deal with some eighties undertones, don't look in this direction.With that said, don't be dismayed. Songs such as "Scar," "From Dusk Till Dawn" and, "No Direction Home" are great power/prog songs with great hooks and drive. I've always been a big fan of the chorus of "From Dusk Till Dawn" because of its all encompassing presence. Its proggy, atmospheric and hooky.The remastered El Nino includes six bonus tracks, one unreleased and five demos. The demo's are hit and miss and are probably only for the hardcore fan. The unreleased "Dreaming" is neoclassical piece that will remind a lot of listeners of early nineties Malmsteen ballad and for good reason since it's a Rising Force cover. A good song but not mind blowing.A strong album revisited that, after a spin, actually deserved to be remastered. I highly recommend checking these guys out if you never had the chance when they first released this disc. If you're not into nineties power and progressive metal, you wont dig this. If you're looking for that style with a different spin, this might be just what you were missing!
A1AD96HV7VCSPT	1	0	much better (and a bit more expensive) than the heavy grips brand. I'm a big tough guy (or at least thought I was) but I can only close the 2.5 a couple of times with my dominate hand. In response to the reviewers who claim that these tear up your hands - well duh!, these have a very aggresive knurling due to the fact that they are serious strength training equipment. To be honest, I wrapped 1/2 of mine with some athletic tape (but at least I didn't cry about it on the review!).
A1AD96HV7VCSPT	0	0	my first EVER one star review.this stuff is so far beyond vile I could not recommend it to anyone with functional taste buds. I've eaten dog, live crustaceans, insects and STILL cant find words to describe how bad this stuff is.
A1AD96HV7VCSPT	1	0	this is exactly what I want. 100% pure, mixes easily, zero taste and CHEAP!micronized creatine monohydrate is all you need. Other products that 'stack' creatine with dextrose (sugar), magnesium and amino acids are not only a waste of money, but they caused me horrific gastric bloat/upset.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	1	1	It is light and fits on keychain. The only drawback is you have to remove the cap - in other words the cap is not attached so you can lose it. But a 2gb jump drive for 20 bucks can't be beat.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	1	1	After seeing the movie, I got this. It wasn't as exciting as the movie obviously (because you can't really sense the emotion and the conflicts on this black and white clip with audio dubbed over from a radio broadcast), but it was interesting nonetheless. I don't know why they didn't just include this game as an extra on the DVD.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	0	0	I really tried to give this game a chance but I got so bored of it. It is so mechanical and it portends to be sandbox but it really is not.Pros: graphicscons: boring. You just follow a yellow-lit path to next quest, click somne buttons and move to next quest. Actually the blacksmith job was the most exciting part of this game.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	0	1	1. The clip is really tight so it does fit on your belt tightly but it's also a bit hard getting it on initially2. it closes with Velcro so you can't just flip open the flap and take out your iphone - you have to tug it open; so this decreases the "flow" of grabbing for your phone and it may seem minor but it gets annoying after a while. In addition on this same point, the phone is *SO* snug and tight that it takes a bit of time to get it into and out of the pouch once you do open that velcro flap. The result is I just end up putting the phone in my front pocket.It's so different than the blackberry one where you seamlessly put your phone in and out of the pouch - but you can't use that with the iphone because of the magnet so don't try.Still looking for an iphone holder as well-designed as the blackberry ones but so far haven't found it.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	0	0	When you plug it into the mac laptop the sound is low and crackly. I am returning this to Target. I wonder if I should buy the Monster ones, but they seem so over-priced. Anyway, if you want a splitter for your mac do NOT get these.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	1	1	Length:: 0:42 MinsMy wife and I fought over using it because it was so fun to use. It is light but gets the job done (see video). There are two speeds. It will blow wet leaves, but not quite as well obviously. Haven't tried the vacuum part yet. Comes with a bag and an attachment to convert it to vacuum mode.
A1AD9C904HUEQI	1	0	This valet stand is nice - i put my wallet and change on top and use the mirror (which pivots up and down) to adjust my tie or comb my hair. Just be careful when you are putting it together - the two side boards fit either way so at the end it was backwards and I had to undo everything and do it all again (which took an extra 10 minutes). No biggie but be careful and you will save the extra 10 minutes I wasted. Otherwise the stand looks nice - nice wood. Doesn't look cheap at all, despite the price.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	This is a splendid recording of Samson et Dalila. Even though it was originally recorded in analog, I have never heard an analog recording that sounded this good before. It sounds digital to me. The sound is clear, with just the right amount of resonance.Domingo sounds great in this July 1978 recording made in Paris. Daniel Barenboim does a fine job with the orchestra and the all-French chorus is excellent; you can plainly hear the authentic French diction. As for Elena Obraztsova as Dalila, if you like huge, voluptuous voices with lots of nasal richness, you will like her. Personally, I love that kind of voice. And her singing is full of excitement; she is very expressive when she sings. Buyer beware: no libretto included. There is another version of this recording on sale with Domingo as Samson on the front cover. I suspect that one has a libretto.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	This recording of "Un Ballo in Maschera", made for RCA in 1966, is first rate. Despite earlier comments to the contrary, the 39-year old Leontyne Price is still very much in her prime here and does some really terrific singing and acting. Carlo Bergonzi is an excellent Riccardo, full of lightness and elegance and humor. Reri Grist is the perfect page, in lovely voice with flawless high notes. The always wonderful Shirley Verrett, though a mezzo, sings the contralto role of Ulrica with firm tones and excellent musicianship. There was a comment that Robert Merrill was past his prime here. I can tell you that he is in better voice for this recording than he was for the Traviata he made with Joan Sutherland in 1962. I was amazed at just how good he sounded and what an all around fine job he did. I also own the Ballo with Pavarotti and Margaret Price, et al. Even though Pavarotti is a fabulous Riccardo, the RCA recording is superior overrall, especially because of Leontyne Price.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	After trying many earplugs during the last 30 years, I have to say that these are the best I've found. They are soft enough to be very comfortable, yet firm enough to hold in place and block the sound. You simply roll the end into a cylinder and insert it into your ear. The noise reduction rating is 33, and they do, indeed, block all but the very loudest noises. The material used is such that you can use them again and again. This makes their price a good investment.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	1	These headphones put out too much treble in relation to the bass. The sound is not balanced. To make it worse, the treble that it does put out gives the sound a rough quality. They may be compact and convenient, but they're not for someone with a good ear.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	1	The sound of these headphones has too little treble and too much bass. You feel like you are seated in the bass section of the orchestra and can hardly hear anything but the basses. I much prefer my Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP earbuds, which have plenty of bass, but it is not overpowering.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	Finally, I have found the recording of the Brahms First Piano Concerto to suit me. I used to own the one on RCA with Gary Graffman and Charles Munch, which was wonderful. Unfortunately, that is out of print. Since then I have acquired the one with Clifford Curzon (he takes it way too slowly), Alexis Weissenberg (the piano is under miked), and Artur Rubinstein (a pretty good rendering). Fleisher beats them all hands down. He gives the most technically flawless and POETIC performance of the bunch. He plays the concerto as if he were on fire. My only complaint is that the acoustics of Severance Hall in Cleveland are a little too dry for my taste.As for the Second Brahms Piano Concerto, Fleisher plays it equally well but, unfortunately, the piano is under miked. He performs all kinds of technical miracles and many of them are simply played over by the orchestra. Don't get me wrong, the orchestra sounds fantastic, but the Brahms Second is not an orchestral piece with a piano obbligato.As for the Handel Variations and the Waltzes, well, ho hum. I would have much preferred hearing some of the smaller Brahms pieces such as the Intermezzos, Capriccios, Rhapsody, or the Hungarian Dances, but they are, nevertheless, very well played.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	First off, despite previous reviews, the sound of this recording is excellent. The piano has a rich, sumptuous sound, so perfect for Brahms. Mr. Lupu plays the Brahms with both passion and an exquisite touch. Comparing this recording to those of Van Cliburn and Artur Rubinstein, incredibly, Radu Lupu's is extravagantly superior in both interpretation and the sound of the piano. Lupu plays the inner voices in these pieces with such finesse, reminiscent of Horowitz. This is one great Brahms CD!
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	I read with interest all the negative reviews. The unit works fine for me, but, in addition to my 1970's television, I have an RCA ANT1250 antenna, an INSIGNIA brand digital converter, and a NEXXTECH brand RF Modulator. I also had a problem with the ENTER key not working until I read in the booklet that the switch at the top of the remote has to be switched to DVD, not TV. One thing I really liked about this unit over the TOSHIBA that I was also auditioning was that the SONY has a wonderful VHS tracking device. I played a tape on the TOSHIBA and got all kinds of wavy lines and garbage. On the SONY, the taped played perfectly.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	I have heard Carmen sung by many mezzos (and sopranos), but I've never heard it sung as well as Grace Bumbry did in this movie. The singing is as close to flawless as I've ever heard. Bumbry surely must have thinned down for this part because her waistline is wasplike. She looks fabulous and struts about in several wonderful outfits.Jon Vickers is not one of my favorite singers, but he looked and acted the part well and, amazingly, sang it well too. He sang the Flower Song almost entirely mezza voce, with a gorgeous pianissimo ending.Justino Diaz was the youngest Escamillo I've ever seen, very realistic, and he did a fine job.Mirella Frena was a beautiful Micaela, and how beautifully she sang!Except for what is usually the mountain scene, the scenery was all very realistic and more than adequate. The costumes were colorful and delightful. One of the other reviewers complained about the polka dots--they did not bother me at all. And the cinematography was better than you would have expected for 1967.Von Karajan did his usual magnificent job with the orchestra. He took some of the song tempos quite slowly, milking out the sensuality. I loved it!I watched this with a friend, and we both agreed that, vocally at least, it surpassed the CARMEN with Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes Johnson. Anyone who is a fan of great singing would be making a serious mistake by passing up this treasure....
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	0	For being just 3 months short of her 50th birthday, Sutherland sounds and looks good. Not her absolute prime, but still pretty good, except that she couldn't make the high E-flat at the end of the Bell Song, which ended up being a short squeak. She also shows up in some gorgeous gowns, almost all of which are low cut and show cleavage. I have never seen an Indian woman showing cleavage. Who did their research?The other singers range from adequate to not quite adequate. The color and picture are good, and the sound isn't bad either. But who can watch it without subtitles? I found it difficult. In addition, the synopsis I was using was different from the one on the printed screen, and they both seemed different from what was being sung.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	1	1	I have read with disbelief some of the negative reviews of this opera. I can tell you with honesty that this is one of my favorite videos. Domingo sings fabulously well, and Verrett sings, and looks, like a goddess. (Actually, Domingo looks pretty good, too.) And the baritone, Wolfgang Brendel, has a strong, ringing baritone that can't be beat! I found the chorus to be excellent, and the scenery and costumes wonderful, especially for a house of the size of the San Francisco Opera. Even the subtitles are easy to read. And, of course, the music is very beautiful. This is as close to perfection as you are ever going to find.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	1	Having read biographies of St. Rita, I was shocked to see this film. For instance, in reality, Rita did not fall madly in love and then get married. Instead, she had wanted to enter a convent, but she was forced into a marriage at the age of 12 by her parents. And the lengthy, ad nauseam, business about two powerful warring families, who eventually become united because of Rita, is just some screen writer's fantasy.Then you have the bedroom scenes, with the muscular hunk of a husband with his shirt off! This is not the way a life of a Saint should be portrayed. In reality, her husband was a brute who treated Rita very, very badly. The Paolo in the movie was a puppy dog in Rita's hands.And the wonderful part of her life, where Rita is lifted into the convent's choir by St. Nicholas of Tolentino, St. Augustine, and St. John the Baptist, was watered down to Rita's simply falling asleep outside on the ground and waking up in the convent garden. As usual, the secular media waters down the miracles. Well, except for the bogus miracle that was made up, Rita's healing her brother-in-law of the plague.At least they did give her the stigmata, but they gave it to her when she was very old and near death, which was not true at all, she lived for many years with that stigmata.There are many more discrepancies, but I don't want this review to be too long.The movie does has beautiful scenery and costumes and cinematography, but what's the point? It is mostly fictional.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	0	Another reviewer stated this this product smelled like fuel. I should have listened; it is an apt description, though it also TASTES bad. I took a spoonful and gagged and gagged and gagged. Well, I finally got it down, I thought, and now I'm done with it. NOT! I belched the stuff for the next NINE hours! Always a glutton for punishment, I mixed a spoonful with my morning hot oat bran. It made the whole bowl unpalatable and I had to throw it out. I have ordered some wheat germ oil softgels, but if they make me belch fuel like the liquid, I'm throwing in the towel. Good luck to those of you made of sterner stuff....6/5/11 Addendum. I am now using the wheat germ oil softgels (made by a different company) with no undesirable side effects. No taste, no smell, no belching!
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	0	I was aware before I bought this that there would be Japanese subtitles. I assumed that English subtitles would be superimposed over them. This was not to be. There are Japanese subtitles only. In addition, Madame Caballe was not, in my opinion, having a good night. The voice often sounded somewhat hoarse and strident, as if she were really tired. Secondly, she kept running out of breath and hurrying the tempo so she could finish the phrase. My favorite aria, Poveri Fiori, was a big disappointment. And the picture quality is absolutely dismal, worse than you can imagine.
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	1	I bought this CD player simply because it was the only one I could find that was not too wide for my entertainment center. Unfortunately, it's a roll of the dice whether the disc changer will work with the remote or not--usually not. Also, It's a roll of the dice whether the player will play a CD or not. I've had brand new CD's out of the box not play at all on this player. I've moved them to another player and they work perfectly. So--unless you're really desperate, I'd pass this CD player by....
A1ADHSN8TVLQ2O	0	1	After struggling with a friend for an hour trying everything in the world to make this player work, I had to give up and put it back in the box. It would sometimes play the CD in tray 3, but ignored all the other trays and would just sit there doing nothing. Save yourself the heartache--DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!!!ADDENDUM--8/14/12Because I couldn't find another changer that was 15" or less deep to fit in my entertainment center, I took a chance and re-ordered this changer. The second one works perfectly and sounds great...today. I'll keep you posted about how long it lasts.
A1ADI1SHT3M0ON	1	1	People who expected an album reminiscent of Satellite Rides are in for a bit of a let down. Drag It Up is, in fact, nothing like their slightly pop-ish last album. Rather it is, as the band has said repeatedly, a more personal album. The songs are a mish mash of previously written songs collected over the years. "Won't Be Home", for example, is originally a Ranchero Bros. song, a side project for Murray Hammond and Rhett Miller. It swings in the familiar fast-pitch twang style that has become so identifiable with the Old 97's music. But "This Is The Moonlight", slows down the pace a little. The song which Rhett Miller originally wanted to put on his solo album, The Instigator,keeps the album grounded. "Smokers" breaks away from the usual stuff Murray Hammond sings and proves to be one of the best tracks on Drag It Up. The intensity of the song builds up as it progresses. "The New Kid" is the song most likely to be everyones favorite as well as a new staple in the band's live performances. It's a sharp expression of jealously, as well as a rip at the momentary fame that comes with celebrity.Two songs, though, which really set the album apart are "Valium Waltz", and "Adelaide". "Valium Waltz" is one of their slower, more lyrically driven songs that has you feeling like rock bottom but wanting to hear it again. As for "Adelaide", it almost sounds like something coming from a folk group, beautiful and harmonic.Drag It Up is not a softening of the band or even flawed for that matter. It's a catharsis of all the things that have occurred since their break, and works that they've wanted to release for some time. The emotional release of Drag It Up is what makes this album so powerful as well as prevents it from being glossed over with people's expectations of what they should be rather than what they really are, an truly original band.
A1ADI1SHT3M0ON	0	0	I just saw this guy on Scarborough Country the other night and he came off as real tool with his broad generalizations and often poorly researched views. If that appearance is at all a reflection of the book then you've sadly wasted your hard earned dollars.
A1ADO4SWOUVOVF	0	0	I loved Diamond's Guns, Germs & Steel, and had similar high hopes for this. Unfortunately, I found it disjointed, anectodal, and very disappointing. Although Diamond is obviously a good man and probably not guilty of this, I got the impression the Montana information was included so he could write off his vacations there. There is valuable information in here, so if you're interested in the topic it's worthwhile, but this has all the hallmarks of a quickie follow up to a commercial success (Guns, Germs and Steel) you expect from a new movie star but not a Pulitzer-prizewinning author. You're better than this, Jared.
A1ADO4SWOUVOVF	1	1	The fact that this can be sold for $10 is incredible. Get it.
A1ADRMCQTUFMUB	1	1	These recipes call for ingredients you can find easily, yet the results are out of the ordinary. It's easy to shop ahead for a week using this book; you don't wind up with a lot of spoiled stuff rotting in the fridge. The recipes fit right in with Weight Watchers guidelines, and nutrition information is given making it easy to figure point counts.
A1ADRMCQTUFMUB	1	1	I absolutely love this book! I got it for my 12 year old granddaughter who is a drawing fanatic and won 300$ in prize money for doing awinter scene for the cover of a magazine. Even though she is already super talented, she thought this was the cutest book ever and loveddoing the drawings in it! I had to get another one to draw along with her, and then my husband wanted one, and then her (my granddaughter's)little sister (age 5)! And when we were done, we all bought more so we could do it again! As you can see, we are obsessed with this phenomenal book!Now we have a whole collection! It is so much fun to see how we had gotten better! The other Amelia books are to die for too! But itwas this one that really got us sucked into the Amelia series. Please, do me a favor and buy this book, 'cause it is wonderful! This is a book for all ages!Seriously. I hope you find this helpful, and no, we are not crazy.
A1ADRMCQTUFMUB	0	0	This cover is all wrong on so many levels. Fix it ASAP! This blonde has nothing to do with the wonderful books.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	I have several pairs of these shoes, they are really comfortable. I especially like the padded LEATHER footbed. Leather footbeds are very hard to find these days, so I bought several pairs of these. My only complaint, & why only 4 stars, is they stretch too much, so this year I ordered a smaller size. While they are true to size, I think the smaller size will be perfect once it stretches.I do recommend these shoes and I hope Ugg will keep the Layback for years to come. I am a true fan.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	0	0	I actually listened to the audiobook, it may not have bothered me as much if I had read the book, but Robards uses cliches to the blithering end...you keep thinking it will be over, that she will write something that is a plain sentence, but no...I guess The End could have been written as a cliche'. I didn't listen.Julie - I hate to think SC could crown such a ditz...IQ is required for Miss SC because she is competing for Miss America. In fact I knew a former Miss SC & I think she'd be insulted. Regardless, the story may be okay but the cliches really ruin it.This author loves chiches, I know that, but this is the worst. I just dare some of you 4 & 5 star reviewers to listen to it.I have listened to several of her books in the recent past.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	How about a lawyer that works out of his car? And this car travels thruout the movie and there is never a car chase. Right there is the unexpected. I think Matthew McConaughey and Marisa Tomei are perfectly cast and they do an excellent job. I read the book ages ago & liked the book as well as the movie. It is great to see a movie that keeps your interest all the way thru it, there is no sci-fi, horror, nor overt sex....there is plenty of violence tho. All in all, this movie is very good entertainment, it kept my interest and that is why it is 4 stars.I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	I bought this book for a friend whose wife is having a little girl. I can't wait to give it to them, it is so precious. I hope my friend reads it to his little girl a lot...I think she will love it too.Highly recommend this to parents of baby girls, little girls, even school age girls.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	I'm a sucker for anything about Nantucket. Even tho I was there only once, I loved it & I always wanted to return. But listening to this book (audio version), I realized it has already changed too much for me. However those who remember Nantucket with a yearning will enjoy this walk thru the island, hearing the author's experiences with fishing and boats, children and beaches, the towns...and parking places. There are other aspects I will not reveal for it is a short tale and you should read it for yourself.Do you love islands and water? If so, I highly recommend this book.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	0	1	I haven't finished the book, tho I am enjoying it & will surely finish it. I am listening to an audiobook, my favorite type of reading.Dinah decides on a whim in the middle of the morning to drive to Atlanta (from Charleston). She tries to find Bobby but, alas he has returned to Charleston for the night. Dinah then drives back to Charleston. She arrives the same day AND she gets home in time to watch 3 hrs of TV before her mother plots for her to go out with Cord that night. Now that is some day! No model of car was mentioned, but I'm thinking Formula One.I hate it when authors don't know the territory of which they write...and then editors don't catch geography errors. This isn't some typo, Charleston and Atlanta are over 300 miles apart by car. 600 miles in no time. What a drive!
A1ADWA4CBB679W	0	0	I had a can opener similar to this one, the difference: it had a handle. That handle made the can opener easy to use. I could not pierce the can with this can opener...and the 2nd can my husband opened, he had the same problem & believe me he is no wimp. We discovered the point on the cutter was very dull, so naturally it was not going to work. Unfortunately the 2nd can we opened was later than the return authorization date, so I have the darn thing.I do not recommend this product, look elsewhere for an electric can opener.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	Lovely story thru letters. I have always loved to read books that were composed of letters, partly or wholely. I do appreciate the author telling the rest of the story at the end. This story is heartwarming and heartbreaking. I do recommend it to everyone.This caveat...it would have been 5 stars and I would have been in tears if I had not had to hold a magnifying glass to read the very small print. The fact that I WOULD hold the magnifying glass attests to the power of the story.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	I love Grsham...his books are page turners. I especially loved this one because it was not only a great mystery, but a travelogue of Bologna, Italy. Grisham's description of the city made me want to go there...even tho I had visited before. I knew I had missed so much.If you don't enjoy that kind of thing, then you may not enjoy this novel. I, for one, did.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	Thomy mustard, it brings back many memories of living & traveling in Germany & Switzerland. We were so happy to find it available at Amazon.com. I guess it is really true, Amazon has everything! This is not a strick Dijon taste, but it is spicier than French's.
A1ADWA4CBB679W	1	1	When we were young (in the dark ages) and had little cash, we would buy a roll of lifesavers and share them as we took a drive...yes, gas was much cheaper. Recently I saw them in the grocery store & bought some. I find they are much better than cough drops, easily accessed (no packing to cut thru)...and of course Amazon.com has them. They are just as I remember.For those of you that suffer from GERD, these will take away the bad taste. They take up very little room in your purse or pocket. I highly recommend these candies...and for little ones, it is always a treat to guess which flavor is next.
A1AE048R7OSKFU	1	1	Only had for 3 weeks but have used 2'ce on Florida lawns. Lightweight - easy to use, critical for 50+ year old woman. Haven't used the blower & understand from other reviews it sucks battery life. I got the deal to include the 3rd battery & find fully charged get about 40 minutes of use; which is enough for a basic lawn. Durability is TBD.
A1AE048R7OSKFU	1	1	I love this translation. It's the easiest read ever. I try to go thru' the bilbe every year and this edition is a big help towards meeting that goal.

A1AE77YQN8E6IR	1	1	Linton Kwesi Johnson's work, My Revalueshanary Fren, beats with the rhythm of reggae and dub but rocks with the non-stop thrum of the real, down-to-earth, local politics of Afro-Caribbean life in urban "Ingland." Is it coincidence that Johnson chooses to rework the first letter and first vowel of the place name of his own personal diaspora? No, because Johnson's poetry is so local and personal that the "I-" shouts to be heard and the "In-" is the inclusiveness that the narrative voice demands, repeating "we are here to stay/inna Ingland/inna disya time yah . . . / (p. 23).The repetition of the "in" sound makes the reader hear that Johnson is in England and yes, to stay. Johnson uses the sound and inflection of this initial vowel to convey purely political intention, not an easy task since a listener can easily miss the poetry amidst the sheer brutality of the events he recants in "Five Nights of Burning."Another initial vowel sound that he employs is the use of the letter `a." Few other words delineate a Jamaican voice from another Carib voice than the way the simple preposition `or' is pronounced, and written by Johnson, as "ar." This hard, clipped semi-guttural usage of the letter a contrasts with the soft o sound of the long double `aa' of `waaking' or the softer, often used `pan.' These two words do not connote political overtones but rather infuse the poems with the melody of street voice, providing a much-needed counterbalance to the "showah every howah" of "people powah" (p. 67).As the street voice blends with the politicized, the sections of the book meld. The sometime melancholy narrative of the last section reads as milder ballast against the shower of rage in the previous sections, notwithstanding the litany of fallen heroes in "Liesense Fi Kill." However, the power of Johnson's word-play to still polemicize in this more ruminant section is apparent by the addition of the letter `e.' Official proclamations surrounding these `sus' deaths turn the government's own use of the word `suspicion' upon itself, accentuating the `lie."
A1AE77YQN8E6IR	0	1	Mike Murdock is not a doctor of anything except deceit. He is a shallow man consumed with materialism and the only blessing you will receive from him is an empty wallet.STAY AWAY from anything put out by this lowest of the low -- a man who preys on people's piety and urges to be blessed by God. You will be penniless in no time if you listen to or read the sacrilegous screeds of this purveyor of blasphemic totems.Would rate it zero stars but that is not an option.
A1AEFU9BVTW9R2	1	1	I picked this title up with the thought of just using it kill time between wanted book shipments. I was pleasantly surprised to find it exciting and interesting. I found myself rooting for certain characters and hoping for an early demise for others. The book links events that happen toward the end of WWII and rear thier ugly heads in the present time. There is not really much in the way of suspense here but I enjoyed it just the same. This has good character development and I enjoyed the style of prose very much (some funny discriptions in here still have me laughing). While the plot stumbles along at some points I don't think you'll be disapointed if you go in with an open mind like I did. I wasn't looking for Willam Peter Blatty and I didn't find him. I was looking for a fun exciting read and was very pleased to have found it.
A1AEFU9BVTW9R2	1	1	Having read Odd Thomas I had to add this to my must read list. I was confused after picking it up due to the title: Forever Odd a novel. Is this a novel? Novel: an invented prose narrative that is usually long and complex and deals especially with human experience through a usually connected sequence of events. Long and complex? Ok, maybe I'll give Dean a little slack. While the book is small and the story a very easy read neither of those facts takes away from a great character. Odd Thomas is a wonderfully developed character that one can't help but find one's self pulling for. This installment has Odd chasing down the kidnapper/s of a dear friend. Once again Odd wants to "go it alone". The chase leads him to an abandoned Casino in the middle of the desert where we meet more wayward spirits. The villian is by no means an "A lister" but formibable none the less. I too, finished this book rather quickly but knew going in that I would. We find old friends from the first book and are introduced to some new ones in this installment but I feel the definition of a great "series" book is one that shows you new characters that will continue to delight you in subsequent offerings. I don't think we will be seeing any of the newly created characters in the Odd sequels (If there are indeed more to come). The prose is wonderful and can transport you to Odd's world if you let it. I will forver be a fan of Odd.

A1AENFHA5L73DT	0	1	Since Paht Thai has always been one of my favorite dishes, I thought I'd start off with that one. Talk about Blah. Based on that, I'm not sure that I'd try another one.
A1AENFHA5L73DT	1	1	Way back when this record came out, I picked it up because it was unique; It turned out to be magic. Cow-Punk, who'd a thunk it? Some times things just work out right. In the years since, I've learned the Kinman brothers are no less than a matched set of diamonds in the rough. Rank and File, along with their other incarnations, The Dils, Blackbird, and Cowboy Nation, have proven it time and again. This is one of my all-time favorites, and if you know good music, you'll like it too.
A1AENFHA5L73DT	0	0	I can't believe the Amazon reviewer liked this so much. It is a waste of money. You'll know it was a mistake within four songs, maybe three. If you want good novelty Christmas music, this is not it. I sure wish I'd done more research than just take the word of the Amazon reviewer.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	0	First let me say, I am a fan of the Anita Blake series, and have been since the beginning. I have even bought the paperbacks, then went back and bought the hardbacks to keep as part of my permanent library. But, I have got to agree with the bad reviews on this book.Ms Hamilton, please get back to stories with a plot (maybe a visit to her old home-town and family).I was 200 pages into this book and had yet to find a plot! Then when I thought I had found the story-line, off it went again. The night-club Incubus Dreams from which the book got it's name, wasn't even mentioned until some where around page 500.The plot was lost in the emotional musings, pointless and tedious sex passage and past issues being re-hashed and re-re-hashed. I mean really! If a sex scene goes on for pages and pages and even stops in the middle of the action for a past issue discussion, it gets tedious. And there are just too many males she is having sex with to keep track of.And by the way I can't stand Nathaniel. He in no way advances the plot (once you find it), and should be the first regular character to be candidate for getting offed. Micah is next on the list, followed by Daimen.I have not sworn off the series yet but any more of this caliber and I will not waste my money.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	1	We certainly can make a case for author's not getting married or divorced.I have seen examples where good authors who were married, thanked their spouses for all their patience, etc in first few books. Then a divorce occurred, and their writting stunk from that time on.Only in this case, I think marriage did Ms Hamilton in. A couple years ago, I noted with interest and good wishes that she had gotten married, but since then her writting has suffered and continues to suffer.Go, rent a cottage at beach, a cabin in the mountains! Do whatever it takes to get back your muse.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	0	I automatically get any work of fiction written by Mr Child, and found this one a little slow.I really liked the story line. The premise is interesting and not one I have run across before.That said, the hero was a little shallow and I found myself skipping pages of description to get to what was really going to happen next.All in all I liked the book, but wish I had bought the paperback instead of the hardcover.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	0	I have been an Anita Blake fan since the first book, buying them as soon as they came out. When they started publishing hard-cover books, I bought the same titles again to add to my permanent library.BUT in the past few books, I have been repeatedly disappointed with lack of plot. This book was the worse so far. Laurell, honey, jumping from dick to dick is not a plot! (a fantasy of yours perhaps, certainly a porno movie, but not really a STORY.)Couple of suggestions - cull the men. Kill off a dozen or so, its too cluttered. Less is more.Next get Anita back to her JOB. Remember that piece of business? Interacting with the police now and then? Making money, fighting the Bad Things (I refrain from adding "not screwing them".) You have backed yourself into a corner where there are no bad things anymore.I would love to see this series get back to where it was, when I couldn't wait for the next book.Best wishes LKH, I will keep my fingers crossed.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	0	I have read this author before and ordered it based on her name.The first time I read it I was not happy with the book. If an author is going to make a universe, somewhere along the way you have to give enough information to tie everything together. The plot seemed disjointed and there were too many unanswered questions.For example: our heroine, who spends an inordinate time passed out, keeps asking how much time has passed since she arrived on planet: weeks, months, years, but we never get an answer. Also, her husband who was very possessive in the beginning of the book, was just cut out of the plot like a piece of bruised apple. What happened to him and the ship?I think part of my dislike was the physical makeup of the book itself. The book is kind of a cross between a normal paperback and a comic book. NOT that there are sketches/drawings in it, and it is much thicker than a comic book, but length x width, it is the same. The paper is crude and the cover not my cup of tea.And to top off all of the above, the weekend I read it, I had the flu, which could have colored my perceptions. So trying to be completely fair, a couple weeks later, I re-read it.I liked it better the 2nd time (of course I had the advantage this time of knowing where it was going). While I still didn't like the format of the book - it didn't suck. I think with a little judicious editing it could have been better and the storyline is one you won't come across often. That alone makes it worth the price.Well fellow reader, give it a go and see what you think. If nothing else it will help support a good author.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	1	Would anyone like to buy a slightly used hard-back book? (Not going to be one added to my permanent collection.) It was like reading a text book in a subject you didn't like much. Slow, pedantic and way way too long. The characters were blah and the action non-existent. Reading this book was several hours of my life I want back!
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	0	Fellow Firefly fans watch out.I am a unshakable fan of Firefly and Serenity (show me a petition to bring it back or make another movie and I'll sign!). I already had the first release and I ordered this one based on the EXTENDED SCENES lure. If you are expecting a longer movie, more of a DIRECTOR'S CUT - this IS NOT IT. The movie is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST RELEASE. The extended scenes are included as a separate item on the DVD. Whoppee.I AM feeling MORE a little ripped off. I now have 2 exactly the same Serenity movies! Joss, honey, you can do better than this.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	0	0	After seeing the promo for the movie, I read some of the reviews and bought the book, looking forward to a good read.I was completely disappointed. I could barely make myself finish the thing. I honestly don't see what the good reviews were about.How can they make a movie out of this? All they did was stand/sit around on a hill. I recommend this to no one.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	1	Immediately after the install, I experienced the black window, etc that other reviewers have mentioned.Be patient, wait. It comes up eventually.Getting into the game after the install is much easier.You can always F2 it and it immediately goes to the menu.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	1	Just to answer previous questions,Werner Stocker is Darius. He wasa talented German born actor, whodied of a brain tumor in 1993
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	1	Not to just fall in line with every other reviewer, but this opus is excellent! I made my husband watch one day when I caught him in a moment of weakness, and much as he hated to admit it - he liked it too.Granted, Shakespear's English is foreign to our modern ear and you have to really listen. If you have any problems with the dialog I would recommend turning on the CC and/or buying the Cliff notes.It's well worth the effort.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	1	This is a mostly light-hearted romp. Boy meets girl, boy looses girl and finally boy gets girl back. The story is timeless, The whole cast was amazing. Recommend it highly.There is a reason why Master Shakespeare endures - he speaks to everyone.
A1AENIRXEDOIZ6	1	1	I just bought this product last weekend and am still trying it out. The main reason I bought it was that my mother, who lives with us, cannot eat fried foods any longer. Soooo, I shopped around and this looked like the best bang for the buck. There are more expensive models available but the extra money did not seem to equate to extra value.I got it home, and cleared a place on the counter (no mean feat). I went to Publix and bought some raw carrots, various types of rice packages and a bunch of broccoli.The accompanying cookbook is laughable - 2 pages. It does give estimated cook times for various foods and that is all. Maybe steaming products is supposed to be so simple it doesn't need instructions. Maybe.I peeled and sliced my pound of carrots and put them in the steamer. They were very good (after I put butter on them). The broccoli was OK but started a fight over crisp vegetables vs well done vegetables. My husband likes them with a bit of crunch. Mom wants mushy.The fact that the rice takes 45-50 minutes was very disappointing, but the rice was very fluffy.Next week I am trying seafood.It is certainly worth the $29 and maybe we will accidently end up eating healthy!
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	1	1	This book was very good, possibly excellent. The pace was good & steady. It was suspenseful but not a heart pounder or nail biter. No unnecesary chase or sex scenes. The characters were beleivable and complex. The ending wraps up but everything is not tied up in neat little bows. It is certainly not a "cookie cutter" popular mystery. That could be the reason some people were dissapointed. I enjoyed it.
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	1	1	i just had to write after reviewing the last review. This book is good - there are many,many large pics with dolls CLEARLY visible. full page pics & 4"x3", 3"x2", 5"x4" pics & on & on. On top of that there are catolog pics with many dolls. This is the nature of books on collectible books. Authurs don't wait till every last rare & unfound item is located & photographed before they add to the pool of info by publishing! we wouldn't get anywhere with history, collecting etc. if we did that. Just to let you know I am selling my edition on this site.
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	0	1	Preparing their children to hate their neighbor appears now to be a "family value" to some in America. Start them young so they are ready to see all those liberals being marched into the ovens without batting an eye. This will be neccesary if they are to save America, so says the right wing. After all the libs have "declared war" on so many things American they say. They are only protecting themselves and their way of life from those who would "destroy" it. You know this to be true if you read the tons of books coming out of the conservative camp or watch FOX news. As a very astute caller said recently when he called into Washington Journal "Bill O'Reiily is fair and balnced, he says so every day". It is never too early to instill fear and loathing in your child. Start early and they will come to see the wisdon and the need for all those ovens their loving parents had the forsight to build. At the very least your child will be prepared to turn a blind eye to it all as so many of their parents are doing now. This is all not too extreme. Think about how much change has already come about. When I was growing up to tell a lie was wrong. Now to call a liar a liar is viscious, vitreolic, unprecedented, beyoooooooond the pale, destroyng America, declaring war on (you name it), unpatriotic, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, traitorous! When things can be turned around that much, killing those you disagree with is not too much of a stretch. Especially if you start them young!
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	1	1	I don't usually read this type of story. I am more a historical mystery, or classics reader. But this book was very good. I did finish it in 2 days even though it usally takes me an average of 10 days to finish a book. A page turner, scary but not terrorizing. Hero was well developed & I could empathize with him. Ditto for many of the other charecters. End was good not super but don't let this disuade you. Well worth reading even if it is not "your cup of tea".
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	1	1	Great Read, character & setting. Mystery was good too! Love the fact that he is a used book dealer too! Worth it! Enjoy!
A1AENZ9UZ6UXE3	1	1	Great, great character - just love this detective - mystery, mood, setting great too. Enjoy!
A1AEV43OPCA802	1	1	Product works great. Sprays nice and even with no clogging. Great for small jobs that don't require a lot of solution.
A1AEV43OPCA802	1	1	Loved the book and the examples that Stormie uses in it. Having her husband and other husbands write about their experiences was great. I will agree with Stormie that had a husband wrote the book it wouldn't of helped us husbands understand the women's needs.
A1AF5LOTCS58Y1	1	1	This is Michael Jackson's BEST ALBUM EVER! Thriller what? I bought this album because I had a gift certificate and didn't know what else to buy. I didn't like MJ at all! Now, even in the year 1999 I still listen to this album frequently and STILL hear sounds I've never heard before!! You don't understand why people love Michael Jackson? Buy this album!!!
A1AF5LOTCS58Y1	1	1	After reading all of these reviews I have to say History is a great album and if you don't have any MJ material to date, it's a must have!! However, this is not his best work. Buy Dangerous to hear that. Stanger in Moscow, They Don't Care About Us, D.S., Money, and 2 Bad are intense tracks! The album as a whole; however is a close third best of his career behind Dangerous and Thriller.
A1AF5LOTCS58Y1	1	1	Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. This album charted on Billboard top 200 albums for two weeks so I know there are alot of you out there who don't have this.BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!! You'll be happy for years to come that you did.
A1AF5LOTCS58Y1	0	0	I was expecting not to like this film alot because I feel Star Wars is maybe the best film of all time. But E-I was worse than I could ever have dreamed. Other than the pod scene nothing in this film was worthy. I was sad for weeks after seeing this film. What a shame.
A1AF5LOTCS58Y1	1	1	I heard Podunk for the first time at a concert in Winooski, VT on July 24th. They were awesome! I had to buy the CD (thanks Jason!) and blasted it on the way home. I hadn't heard such rockin' album in years! It was so good in fact, I had to see them again. Three days later I saw them again at Northern Lights in Clifton Park, NY. It ruled to be able to sing along with them, who quickly have become one of my favorite bands!
A1AF5V9PI64BRO	1	1	Several years ago I lost weight Somersizing. I'm back so that I can continue to eliminate junk from my diet and lose 25. I learned how to cook vegetables the first time around and am so grateful to Suzanne for bringing vegetables into my diet. The only canned food I buy is tomato puree and beans. However, I really recommend olive oil over butter, and I this time around I'm moderating dairy. I also am no longer addicted to diet soda - I'm too afraid of the chemicals now. I really can see a correlation between this way of eating and the original European/Mediterranean Diet. My mother passed away from cancer 5 years ago at 69. When she moved to this country, she thought she was a health nut, but we ate a lot of processed foods. Our kitchen had mac & cheese, condensed soups, margarine, milk, ice cream, white rice and pasta. Mom often struggled with 30 extra pounds. She eliminated garlic and fresh herbs, because these were not popular in the US when I was growing up. I have herbs and vegetables growing everywhere, much like my Greek grandmother, and love the Farmer's Market! My grandma lived to almost 90, my grandpa, 102! I really believe that fresh food and moderate food combining is wonderful for you. I now eat food based on how it will make me feel later. I don't dare diet - who wants to feel awful? At 38, I also now realize that deprivation dieting ages you faster. Even though I need to lose these last pounds, the olive oil and fats make me look much younger than I am. Also, one unhappy result of low-fat diets was that I lost weight in my chest first (not pretty when you have no fat there and have had 2 children). This never happened with Somersizing!** Update - 1-20-11- I was pregnant and didn't know it yet when I posted! Although I need to lose baby weight and I'm back and looking forward to getting back into shape again. Recovery from this pregnancy has been really hard. I've had several months of physical therapy and the baby was/is extremely colicky. That makes it challenging to feeling up to anything, but it's time! It's wonderful to be able to eat large, Mediterranean-like meals. I miss sugar, but having a morning fruit really helps. I'll check back with a new update.
A1AF5V9PI64BRO	1	1	I was impressed that this diet can truly turn your health around. The descriptions of food and all the vitamin benefits made me realize that every time I eat fresh food, I am doing something good for myself. For years, I was looking at good food as 'diet food,' and unfortunately gravitated to processed 'fun' food. I now no longer experience the constant lethargy that I had in my teens and twenties. I realize that candy (except dark chocolate), soda, ice cream, and cake will make me literally feel ill. I wasn't connecting my diet with energy. I was only interested in losing weight no matter the cost. I'm so glad to always keep the Mediterranean diet as a way of life. My Greek grandfather lived to be 102 and said "I eat a little of everything." It's true that he may have sampled all kinds of food, no matter the nutritional content, but I know that 90% of his diet was fruit, meat, vegetables, herbs, and whole grains. My grandmother also used some white rice and white flour, but the majority of daily foods were simple and fresh. She lived to almost 90. I think eggs are an excellent, clean source of protein. I see no reason to limit them.
A1AF5V9PI64BRO	1	0	My brother bought and mailed me this book several years ago. I was struggling under some abusive church authority and confused. Thankfully, this book helped remind me that God is not the author of confusion. Some things in this book were an outright revelation - like the meaningless traditions that all churches follow, no matter what denomination or orthodox. Other facts were harder to accept like the way tithing is expected in modern churches. I began studying the Bible like never before to find answers. I found that churches want to recreate an Old Testament model, complete with temple and priests (pastors). It's really holding the church back. God wants to do so much more through us, but we don't want to go there! I've used this book as a starting place to examine many things I took for granted.I found that Paul said we are the building - so why do churches spend so much money (millions) and effort to build 'temples?' I think there is great variety in ministries and have seen God allow building programs to flourish, but I have to wonder, is this really what EVERY church body should be doing? I've been a part of music programs where the music minister (can't really find one of those in the NT) proudly calls us the Levites. In my Bible studies, I found that these things had passed away and that God favors no man! How about those churches that won't give anyone else mic. time in case they have to do damage control? We are a long way from where we should be!The tithe threw me for a loop. I have given thousands of dollars to churches over the years. If God instituted 10% in the OT, my Dad says that's a good place to start. However, the NT says to give what you feel led to give. It certainly means to be generous and support missions, but the rigid, weekly tithe is in direct violation of the 'liberty' from Jewish law that Paul talks so much about in the NT. The verses used to make people tithe were about specific mission gifts that Paul arranged and not meant to be legalistic. Yes, it bothers me still because there is a lot of guilt not adhering to this legalism and I don't want anyone to think that my 'understanding' is just an excuse not to give. I also don't want to give up my responsibility to actually give money where it is intended instead of generically dropping it in a plate and letting someone else do the work for me exclusively. We self-righteously put 10% in the plate while the person next to us is drowning in debt and we think they deserve to suffer and not be helped! Besides, we're pretty strapped after giving 10% and can't imagine giving over-and-above. Americans are the most giving people, but the church almost never helps its people in a true financial way, other than the staff salaries. What's wrong with this picture? It's okay to give millions to Africa, but all I get on Mother's Day is a flower? Yes, most churches help their people in a pinch, but they are not set up to continuously help their Christian community of widows and orphans, etc. Why? Because the cost of running the biggest church in my small town is $70,000+ a week. It makes me sick when there is dangerous ice on the roads that one pastor begs people to come to church or not to forget to submit their tithe electronically. Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! I don't like it at all.Also, what about the 10 Commandments? Obviously, God's character and desire is shown through all scripture. If the Sabbath was Saturday originally, and the new Christians changed it to Sunday to signify Christ risen, then what are we supposed to do? Are the 10 commandments part of the old law? My husband and I have had some interesting discussions about this! Certainly, much of the 10 Commandments specify things that are indeed sin, whether OT or NT.God has been generously gracious with His church, even with her flaws. I'm excited to see what our future holds. Meanwhile, I'm open to God's leading as I let His Word continue to teach and lead me.
A1AF5V9PI64BRO	1	1	I really like the positive reviews that have so many success stories. I'm one of those people who can eat very moderately and maintain or gain. Then it takes me a month and very hard work to lose 2-3lbs. Very discouraging to say the least. I also eat extra before going somewhere in case I 'crash' with a blood sugar low. I tried to add a little protein to everything last week and I noticed that I was satisfied and didn't have any blood sugar lows. I purchased the Kindle edition last night and I've been pleasantly surprised at how helpful it is with plenty of meal examples. My cholesterol has also been elevated for several years and I really look forward to some improvement. I also need to lose 15-20lbs to get to a healthy weight, as I am 142 at 5' and 41 years old. I will update my progress.Update: This book gave me so much good information and set me on the right path. However, just linking food did not cause me much weight loss. There just wasn't enough structure and I like to eat a huge variety. It got me ready for The Mediterranean Prescription, which is working wonders for me, so I think that everyone overweight should understand insulin resistance.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	A spectacular whodunnit with brains and a twist. Beautifully executed, Identity brings together ten people connected by a single surreal link. Nothing is as it seems, and everyone has a hidden agenda. The performances are perfect and creepy, and the plot is engaging, so the 90 running minutes seem to fly by. Ending with a flourish reminiscent of The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or Memento, Identity is a perfect ten. You will be telling your friends about it.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	Fight Club is elegant and brutal, sophisticated and terrifying. It makes you squirm and ask for more... You will watch it twice. Fight Club asks the life questions that every consumer in the USA should be asking of themselves. It grabs our values by the throat and demands that they answer for themselves. Beautifully photographed, the movie is dark and disturbing in hopes that you will not lose the point. It admonishes but never preaches. It challenges without giving the answers. Fight club is about soap, and one man's search for meaning. It's about loyalty, leadership, and the mentality of the pack. It may stretch your sensibilities, but it will definitely make you think.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	Northworld was a fun read. The characters were simple, direct, and easy to understand. Drake's short discussions of how he lifted the plotlines from Norse mythology added a lot of interest.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	0	0	Multiple Streams of Income is a whole lot of hype punctuated with just as much bad financial advice. Like a carnival barker, each in your face chapter espouses themes as ridiculous as &quot;Network Marketing Is The Income Stream of the Future.&quot; The &quot;advice&quot; in this book is worthless and unactionable. Test it for yourself. Pick up the book, read any single chapter, (this will take no longer than five minutes) and then write down on a piece of paper the specific steps you would take to generate the miraculous stream of income the author describes. You will find that like all peddlers of poof he has skipped over the challenging elements or potential points of failure for each scheme. If you really need to generate additional income, you'd be better off finding someone in an honest line of work and asking them how you can learn the ropes. Books like this one build unrealistic expectations and then crush the spirit of those who attempt to follow and fail. The poor souls who pin their hopes on these cheapjacks blame themselves rather than the true author of their failure... another huckster with a handful of magic beans.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	For many entrepreneurs, the passion for their business is fueled by a loftier goal than the wealth garnered from its operations. For Jeff Hawkins, inventor of the Palm Pilot and the handwriting recognition system Graffiti, the goal has been a lofty one indeed. Jeff Hawkins wants to know how the brain works and he has spent twenty years of his life doing the research."On Intelligence" from Times Books presents Hawkins' new unified theory of real intelligence. It is Hawkins' hope and premise that if we actually can understand how the brain works to create intelligence in human beings then we will be able to take these principles and use them to build computers that think the way we do. He definitely has his work cut out for him.Trying to understand how the neo cortex works sounds like a difficult task and one that would involve a large number of long words. It does. However, Hawkins largely avoids the problem. He deftly simplifies his model of how the brain works and through the course of the book's eight chapters makes a potentially difficult topic quite approachable in much the same way Carl Sagan brought astronomy to the masses.Hawkins opens the book by explaining why artificial intelligence has not lived up to its promise. Twenty years after computerized speech recognition became available it still does not work to our satisfaction. He identifies the major trends in artificial intelligence and neural networks and explains why they have failed to deliver substantial results outside of very highly specialized environments. His explanations are clear and to the point. As Hawkins founded both Palm Computing and Handspring and invented the Treo Smartphone, he knows exactly what technology can and can not do.Hawkins explains that his theory proposes that the human brain is a pattern recognition machine that breaks complicated topics into smaller chunks of time related events and then compares it to known experiences. He portrays the brain as a series of stored patterns all existing in the neo cortex, a neuron packed organ about the size of a dinner napkin, all crumpled up inside our skulls. His simple analogies to dinner napkins, playing cards, hierarchies and feedback loops explain how we can recognize a song even though we are hearing it in a different key than the first time we heard it, and that we can recognize a friend's face in a crowd despite changing angles, lighting conditions, apparent size, and distance. Hawkins explains that the human computer instantly recognizes the significant difference between a person standing at the front door with a wrapped birthday gift and another with a crowbar, and that no computer built would even have much of a chance of figuring out that the crowbar was not part of the person. The Real Intelligence that Hawkins seeks is not to be found be amplifying artificial intelligence. They are different approaches entirely.After the preliminary work of explaining his model, Hawkins does lead the reader through one chapter stuffed with schematics, charts, and jargon. The reading becomes difficult for a few pages as the cortex is divided into layers and their various functions described. The payoff for completing this chapter is a better understanding of how our brains decide to form new memories and how subdivision of information within our cortex makes hopelessly difficult tasks possible. The material might be dense in places, but Hawkins does his best to bring it to the reader in common terms.Hawkins then concludes the book with brilliant chapters on consciousness, creativity, and the future of intelligence. Without becoming deeply philosophical, he discusses the intelligence of animals, the significant shifts of biological memory systems over millions of years and how design professionals can develop systems that integrate more smoothly with the way our brains work. He finishes with speculation on the future of real intelligence and how it might improve automotive safety, weather prediction, and medical research."On Intelligence" seems positioned to become a landmark book in the popularization of the study of human brain as a path to understanding real intelligence. Hawkins opens the book with "I want to build truly intelligent machines" and then gives you an explanation of just how much progress has been made in the field. If Hawkins doesn't build intelligent machines in his lifetime, then surely a student inspired by his work will.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	0	1	I would like to use the Linksys adapter with my Toshiba laptop. I have sometimes actually made the combo work. No other device in recent memory has caused me as much frustration as this adapter and my laptop which is now running Windows XP SP2.Range: I have had excellent results in my house, on my back deck, etc. I am using a T3 PDA which does not have the range that this adapter has, so it is always the limiting factor.Installation: I installed under XP and then after an unrelated machine wipe reinstalled under XP-SP2. Installing under SP2 is possible if you go to the website first, read the special instructions and follow their recipe. It is a technical pain the butt. It does work, however. Until...What's wrong: My device worked perfectly until I booted my computer away from the hub and bluetooth adapter. Since then, Bluetooth does not work. To get the bluetooth to work again, you have to follow the installation instructions for reinstalling the drivers, then it will work again, until the adapter is moved to another slot or fails to load.The promise of USB is that I can plug and unplug devices at will and everything will still work. This device requires reconfiguring the software every time you plug it in. I would gladly trade it for anything that did not have that problem.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	This is a wonderful book that will positively motivate you to create and keep a personal journal. The author's quirky insights, delightful pictures, and easy going style make starting and keeping a journal an uplifting experience.
A1AFBBOZL69ARP	1	1	This is a fun little toy. My kids aged 5 and 3 love it. Of course, I supervise, but we talked about counting, how the sparks work and practice taking turns. The sparks are a great effect and they like seeing how it looks different in the light and in a darkened room. The gadget feels pretty sturdy, but certainly would not withstand any physical abuse. I was surprised at how actively the kids engaged with it. The big winding key is a nice touch. It makes it easier for small hands to wind. Incidentally, my adult friends liked watching it as well and began immediately speculating how it worked. It's an interesting diversion at a reasonable price.
A1AFDQROSD35E1	0	0	I thought the sound quality was decent. However, the phone stopped functioning after less than a year. I changed the battery but to no avail.
A1AFDQROSD35E1	1	1	I've been in the field for roughly 10 years and I find this book to be provide sound theortical and practical advice. There are a lot books that explain the theory/science of project management (pm), but few that also deal with the art of pm. Yes, advanced theories and methods are useful, but 80% of your time is spent on the basics, which most PM get wrong, at least part of the time, during a project.The book's focus in on-track. It provides the author's personal perspective and advice based on "war wounds." I use it as a primier reference for day-to-day issues on projects and serves as a useful reminder on issues we take for granted.
A1AFDQROSD35E1	0	0	I concurr with the other reviews. The vaccum lasted less the 8 months. The roller doesn't work and when using the hose (only thing that works) it emitts a burning smell.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	This is a simple kit that I use around the house but mostly with my computers. I like the feel they have. I have purchased cheap "bargain" sets before and you can definitely tell the difference in quality. I Just look at the edges and notice that these have a good finish, smooth. Unlike cheap bits which have rough edges and chip away very easily. The magnet on these is not very strong but good enough for working with computers.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	I really enjoy this tool. I purchased a DuraPro 02-157 and the Ratcheting Mechanism was very bad. On this one it works well even with loose screws. A friend of mine used it a couple of times and he commented how nice it feels in his hands and loved how this screwdriver gave him leverage in certain situation which his Snap-on did not. After using the DuraPro 02-157 this screwdriver felt like a high end screwdriver to me. I have been contemplating buying a second one.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	It works well. How do I know? My blood count went up. It taste like your drinking out a metal/Iron mug/cup. It goes away in about 15 to 20 minutes. For the price I can't complain. At the local pharmacy it cost 16 bucks for basically the same thing. The one at the Pharmacy has a green sugar coat and it goes down without the Iron taste. My sister told me to get "Ferrous Gluconate" because it gets absorbed in the intestine and less likely to upset my Stomach. I took one star away for the wonderful taste of Iron Yumm Yumm.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	These are delicious. They are tart and sweet. Before purchasing these I purchased some organic, no sugar added Dried Cherries. These are a bit sweeter but not obnoxiously sweeter, just a bit sweeter than the no sugar added. The Organic Cherries were almost twice as much as these. The organic were 20 dollars for 2 pounds. I purchased the Traverse for $28.62 one time delivery. I have joined the subscribe and save program for $24.33. Can't beat it for the price.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	This coupling worked well. It's easy to install and so far I have no leaks. It's sturdy, much better than the plastic coupling I had purchased earlier.
A1AFEBSIOZ2G7I	1	1	This product arrived in record time. It is easy to assemble. Sturdy and good quality. Great for heavy jackets/coats. I love it!
A1AG4I55204X1W	0	1	Having read Bryson's &quot;The Mother Tongue and How it Got that Way&quot;(a terrific book), I thought he found so much fault in all around him that I just couldn't finish this diatribe. I was astounded at the depth of his angry ranting against the people he met, the architecture and their society. I was so surprised, having read a number of positive reviews to find this book without much to recommend it.
A1AG4I55204X1W	1	1	Mr. Ritchie pulls you through a fascinating history of lessons he learned, most often from those who worked with their hands, and then applied them during four careers, a captain of a ship, a senior executive in an international company, a consultant and several directorships with puplic companies. His very well written autobiography captures with much warmth and humor the characters and events which helped shape his life's philosophy. His unique insights on managing people and making difficult decisions reveals a thoughtful and caring individual. Many would do well to read this journal for its win-win business and personal ethics.
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	1	1	This is one of the coolest phones I've ever owned. It sounds great, the features are fairly easy to navigate and figure out and the ringtones are great! It's creeping up on the holiday season and I have it set to play a Christmas song. Plus you can personalize ringtones, setting a different ring for each friend or family member so you know who is calling you just by the song the phone plays.Excellent purchase!
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	0	0	I purchased this item elsewhere and had a heck of a time with it. If you use all four bars, it's too tall. If you use only three, it's too short (this is going from tub to ceiling, not floor to ceiling). Then to top it off, it started rusting within 3 days. Shouldn't something that's made for the tub be rust-proof???The only good thing about it is it does what it's supposed to do, it holds bath accessories. Once I got it in the shower, that is. Since the 4th bar made the pole too tall, I had to place it in the tub with just the three bars and bunch up hand towels under the bottom of it to hold it in place.
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	1	1	I bought this for my laptop because, like others, I HATE touchpads. And this little mouse is just perfect. Works well, plugs right into the USB port, and my laptop (which has Vista) picked it up automatically and I was using it right away. At first I wanted a wireless mouse, but I've used wireless before and they were more of a pain than they were worth, so I wanted to try a wired mouse and I really like this one. The cord is short (so I'm not constantly fighting a wire) and wraps around the mouse for storage and I don't have to worry about it 'dying' on me because I forgot to charge it.It's smaller than a standard mouse, yes, but it's not so OVERLY tiny that it becomes a pain to use. Even my boyfriend uses it with no problems and he's 6'2 and has pretty good-sized hands and he says the size of the mouse doesn't bother him.If your USB port happens to be on the left side of your laptop (and you're right-handed) this probably won't work for you because the cord wouldn't be long enough to string all the way around the back of your computer to reach comfortably to the other side. But if the USB port is on the right side or even in the back, you should be just fine.I personally love the way the cord wraps around the mouse itself for storage. You just wrap the cord into the side grooves, snap the USB plug into place (which covers the optic lens) and drop it into your laptop bag.Very pleased with this mouse all the way around.
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	0	0	Not worth the money, in my opinion. Not only do they start repeating items to bid on, showing the same thing over and over again, but the characters are creepy as all get out. I'm not pleased that I wasted money on this.
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	0	1	If they hadn't said this movie surpasses the original, I may not have expected as much. But I did and the movie didn't deliver for me. From start to finish all this movie was is screaming, running, biting and shooting. And that's pretty much it.It'll take far more than just a "clever" (well, not really) plot to surpass 28 Days Later.
A1AGGPPP5P79WL	0	0	And doesn't anyone else notice a few things? One, Terry-Thomas was KILLED in the first one. Yet in the second one he's one of the inspectors. Secondly, Phibes rested beside his wife for THREE years before rising once again (although technically this wouldn't have been possible because in the 1st one he infused his body with embalming fluid) to avenge his wife. But on the back cover of the DVD, it says he rested for "a decade" before bringing himself back to life. Also, when making one of his 'kills' while in the desert, he used a massive industrial-sized fan to cover up any noise he may make so as not to alert the others in nearby tents that something odd was going on. Okay, so, in the middle of the desert, where did he get the electricity to power it? Yeah, okay, he could have used a generator. But, being realistic, the sound from the generator alone would have woken everyone up. Not to mention the fact that it would take way more manpower than Phibes and his little assistant to drag the thing to the campsite and they would need gasoline and oil to power it up. Where would they get *that* in the desert?Little things like this are probably of no real consequence, but they bug me. It just shows me that, compared to the first Dr. Phibes, this one was very poorly made. There are other odd quirks, but they're not worth going into. It's one of those movies you have to pay close attention to and you'll see them. Overall, I think this movie stinks. There's no real detail or ingenious thought to Phibes' murders.I never expect sequels to be as good as or better than the first movie because we all know that rarely happens. But it's like they got lazy with this one and just threw it out there to try and make a few extra bucks.
A1AGPU9O2W3MH7	1	1	&quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; eclipses anything done for TV having to do with war. War should not be made to look glorious. &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; does not. It shows combat with an honesty that is rarely seen on any large screen, much less on television. Rick Schroder continues to impress as he enlarges his arsenal of acting skills as Major Charles Whittlesey. He actually makes his boyish looks heighten the heroism of his character by utterly ignoring them as he fills in all the textures of this whip-smart lawyer with a backbone of steel. The ensemble cast is a perfect compliment to Schroder. Still, the real star of this movie is, and should be, the incredible stand these battered but brave men made against truly impossible odds. It's a story long overdue in the telling and A&amp;E tells it without flinching or softening. This is one of the finest war films ever made -- for ANY medium.
A1AGPU9O2W3MH7	1	1	When I first saw &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; on TV back in the 70s, I was swept back in memory to those hoary days in the early 60s when we were all glued to our black &amp; white sets wondering if WWIII was about to begin. We didn't know quite what to make of our young president who had already become the victim of a botched Bay of Pigs invasion. We feared Nikita for his bombast, power and unpredictability. It was plain to see that he was trying to provoke us. In &quot;The Missiles of October,&quot; William Devane IS JFK. We get to see, perhaps for the first time, the man behind the Camelot legend. He is tough, committed, ethical and strong in ways that everyone underestimated. Howard DaSilva and Martin Sheen are superb in support. Ralph Bellamy, as Adlai Stevenson, deserves special praise for his dynamic recreation of the confrontation in the UN Security Council. Compared to &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; or &quot;How Kevin Costner Saves the World -- Again,&quot; &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; is a far better production on all levels. This, along with very few other offerings, ranks as the very finest television ever broadcast!
A1AGTJW5GQK98V	0	0	I think this movie was played out along time ago but to go and make the first episode was a waste of time and money. I think that the other star wars episodes were fine and then they have to go along and make a new one. This movie has been played out to many times
A1AGTJW5GQK98V	1	1	I absolutely loved this movie...I love suspense and it justkept building up through out each scene. My most tearful moment in themovie would have to be the scene w/ the mother and the son in the car (thats all i will tell you). I think that if you like a little suspense w/ a little sci-fi twist than this movie is so for you!
A1AGVKWY53U0GX	1	1	This book gives a good overview of the types of images that are required if you plan to shoot a formal wedding. There are plenty of good tips and many excellent photos as examples. Recommended.
A1AGVKWY53U0GX	1	1	If you love the band, you'll love this book as well. I somehow missed getting it while still in print. A quick online search turned up a site that received permission from the author to post and offer it as a free download. Thank you Mike Chunn for making this available for posterity!
A1AGVKWY53U0GX	1	1	First off, the track listing on this webpage is incorrect as of 11-2-09.This is personally one of my favorite Split Enz albums. It captures the band with a more folky, acoustic sound than what followed. The songs have a haunting quality that remains with you for a long time.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I was surprised at the high quality of this item. Very handy. Cleans well in dishwasher..
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I you do wok cooking you must have this. Excellent quality. The tongs are very handy. Cleans ok in dish washer. Excellent price...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Overall a good unit. It is an IR detector (temp diff) in desert hot summer works sometimes and sometimes not. Works good in winter..I added a X10 sensor unit to receiver and it sends a signal to the X10 Ding Dong unit plugged into any wall plug around the house and garage. This will wake you up...The X10 units must be plugged into same ac circuit to work. Most houses have 2 circuits 220V.Note: The detector comes with sensitivity and range set to (on) max (switches down with head pointed to ceiling). After 5 years the plastic lens gets brittle and decreases sensitivity.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	0	0	It is a nice dish, but I read a report from government warning about pyrex dishes exploding in the oven. Something about company using a cheaper glass. I don't know if this one is involved. But I threw it away just to be on safe side...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	My old 2800 genset voltage regulator quit working so I bought the Max. I have read all the reviews and was aware of the shipping damage problems.I received the unit by UPS and there was no damage. The box was intact and good shape. I unpacked the unit and installed the dolly wheels (install wheels before filling oil and gas. The dolly kit was not great but ok. Be sure to thread the nuts on all bolts and brackets as most have paint on threads and very difficult to screw on. Also, some of the bolts threads are messed up and need to be run through a grinder to clean up threads.When you install the handle brackets, be sure to mount the handle hole below the cage bar. Then handle will work fine. Be sure order the dolly kit as the genset is heavy and hard to handle.. The dolly kit is cheaper than any others out there...After the dolly was installed, I filled up the oil. Oil takes about 1/2 qt. You must use a flex funnel. Be sure to keep the genset level otherwise you can put too much oil in it.I put some gas in it. Now before you start engine (switch off) pull the engine through to lubricate the engine and make sure that engine turns over smoothly..Switch on,,choke engaged, engine started in one pull. Choke off and engine reved up to speed. I used a "Kill-a-Watt" meter (Amazon)to check voltage, frequency and power load. The genset checked out ok. Voltage was right on 120V and 60 cycles.You best have the Kill-a-Watt meter when using Gensets. Best checkout power outputs before you plug an expensive frig or freezer into genset. Also the meter will show the actual Watts being used.The Max had no damage from shipping other than a small dent on the bottom of the frame. I think this was done at the factory as box showed no damage...My old genset (2800W) look like it was made in the factory. It is just scaled down from the Max.One problem I ran into with old genset was that the fuel shutoff value on gas tank has a gasket that swelled and restricted fuel flow and caused a surging of the engine. I drilled out brads of the valve took it apart and fixed the gasket. I drilled out the brads and replaced them self taping metal screws. Worked great. The Max uses the same gas shut off as other genset. So expect a problem might pop up with valve.Don't know about long term use as havent had to use it yet. But what I am reading on the reviews is that it is pretty good...All in All the Genset was a very good buy (be sure to get the dolly)[[ASIN:B00009MDBU P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor]Amazon] is also very important. Amazon shipping was very good and timely... With the way the world is going, I am thinking about buying another one.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	0	I bought this item for the purpose of linking my Directv model R22 receiver to my wireless internet group. Do not use the cd that comes with it. The CD was confusing and would not work anyway. Plug in a computer using a RJ45 cable from computer to the Wap54.Enter the address of the unit in the computer browser 192.168.245. The log in will come up. The factory password is admin and user is (blank).When the setup menu comes up the first is a list four modes of operation. Choose the second mode and it will have a network search button. Press the button. A list of available wireless net works will come up. Choose the one that you use. The unit will automatically configure itself with the security codes and parameters of the net work. Be sure that the default gateway address is the same as your network router. Note: in the setup menu there is a config backup. Be sure to backup the working config..If the above doesn't work try plug the lan cable into the back of the router along with the pc lan cable.When all is set correctly you should be able to browse the web with the computer plugged in the WAP54. Now it is ready for the R22 receiver.Now plug the RJ45 cable into the top connection on back of the R22 dish receiver. Go to the net work setup menu if it doesn't connect make sure the R22 has the correct default gateway address listed...I first tried to use the WRT54G2 router I could not get it to work.. After researching the web I figured out the difference between a Wireless access point unit and a router. Linksys does a very poor job of explaining it. In fact Linksys has very little information about their products. There is a Adobe manual on the CD that helps a little bit. DO NOT try to load the so called automatic helper program. This thing is a major pig and eats up PC resources and is very hard to remove.. MAJOR can of worms. Plus Linksys tech support is terrible. They do not want to hear from you... Maybe you will have better luck than me..You can get this unit from Directv for double the Amazon price. Why bother. Directv tech support is not all that good either..Good luck...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	The hat was promptly delivered. Best hat I have ever had. I worked in the fields this summer repairing and installing fences. The hat was a perfect fit provided excellent shape and ventilation. I handles the wind very well... No sun burn on my head at all.... Love my new hat...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Arrived in a timely manner. 8% is a bit strong for use. Instructions are included to cut it down to 3% for use on scratches and open cuts on the body. I use it to brush teeth. It kills the bacteria on the teeth and mouth sores... Do Not swallow it... Rinse mouth after use... Food Grade doesn't have the heavy metals for stabilizers as the drug store type does.. Must be kept in the ice box.Many books on Amazon on use of H2O2.Update 10/2011: Don't use to (3%HP) brush teeth if you have fillings. Don't know for sure, but the 3% might effect the glue used to hold fillings in.... But, I spray my tooth brushes before used to kill bacteria.Also, discovered that using 3% SPRAYED ON joint rash (sticky kind) dries it up and takes away the sting.... Works also on under arm odor.Great for killing mold. There is a yellow mold that gets on the bath room sink and shower due to the super efficient water softener and filter system (takes out all the chlorine). The 3% kills yellow mold dead.Just my opinions use your own judgment...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I use the pan to cook breakfast. This my second one. Do not crack eggs on the side. This will eventually cause the silicone non stick coating to break and peal.. Use only the Teflon spatulas or the teflon will chip.. Regular plastic ones will not work and will damage it...Heavy bottom and cooks eggs perfectly with or without oil and will not stick...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	It is a bit confusing to use the menu system is odd...But, it works ok and I use it for marking good fishing holes on a lake. Also good for back tracking to the dock after dark. Practice using it before going out in a boat...Excellent for walking in the woods. Love the compass. Be sure to put in fresh batteries before starting trip. In fact, carry some with you...The manual is well written and easy to carry with you with batteries in a zip plastic bag...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	The ear phones are good quality, but each phone has a wire hanging down forming a "Y". This is clumsy and a pain. Wires get twisted quickly and messy to untangle. Why not one wire to the Phones?.The head band construction is a cheap plastic and can be broken easily if you sit or step on them... Not something for kids...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Excellent knife, blade very sharp and easy to flip out with one hand. I use it to thin slice tomatoes and onions.Great for cleaning fish. I spray the knife with Hydrogen peroxide (walmart) to clean it up..Belt clip works good although it will pop off if you are brush against something.Do not use the knife as a screw driver. Blade is brittle and will not bend...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Nice coffee grinder. You have to be careful of "over-grinding". Beans that are turned into "powder" don't brew very well. They clump up and foul the filter.Pulse the motor until you have the correct consistency. You learn by trial and error...I prefer to brew right after grinding. Sitting overnight on a timer for morning, looses some of the flavor...I looked at other types of grinders but most very expensive. I never buy anything without checking Amazon first... Nine times out of 10, Amazon has the best deal....
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	0	When I got the board I thought It was the wrong one. I was fussing around filling out the return form, when my granddaughter (10) looked at the old boards and said. "grandpa you have it upside down." Yep, I did, and the new board snapped right in. It is hell, getting old..Be sure to use a static strap on your wrist to the computer.. The old mem boards would blow if you looked at them wrong. These new boards are pretty safe, but still better be safe than sorry...My old Gateway NX570(Vista) is really humming now.. Firefox (I remember the Gofer browser) loads much faster.A good test is the new Google Earth 6. The new ground level walk around mode will test your computer... GE works good with the new memory. But, while 1.5 gb is good,,, still could use another GB. Got to order another one.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I weigh 270+ and the stool is rock solid standing on top step. It is very light and easy to carry. The locks are well designed and easy to open. Just be careful and not pinch the skin between the thumb and fore finger.Solid construction with solid rivets. No nuts and screws to work loose. The two bottom steps are aluminum with no slip pattern in the metal step. The top step is a heavy hard plastic with a non slip pattern. The top step is one piece enforced molding underneath The plastic will not bend or wiggle. Solid as a rock.The feet are covered with a tough heavy flexible rubber plastic riveted on. No way can they slip off. Works great on all floor types..If you hate "wobbly" stools of unknown load carry rating,,, you will love this little guy...You will have to keep an eye on this handy stool as it will "walk" off when others are around...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	The heating pad works as advertised. The selector switch is well designed and easy to operate. The large pad makes for easy applications.Good price, (compared to local drug stores).
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Well made with stainless steel and easy to fold and use. I use it for "overflows" when my clothes line fills up...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	0	0	The light is weak, but better than nothing.. It lasted about two hours and went dead... I am not going to send it back. Not worth the cost, time and trouble... Amazon has been very good to me and I will not put them through the expense of returning such a worthless item...I should know better, I have never seen one that worked very long. Twisting the thing puts pressure on the computer USB plug and could damage it.. Best get a clip on led light with it's own battery.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I find it hard to believe that such neat digital scale cost so little. I have been using a laboratory beam scale to weigh silver coins in grams then convert to troy ounces. Major pain. I received the 500 scale from the seller very quickly. Very good service...Now a low cost accurate digital scale that measures in troy ounces, wow! Yes, it is accurate compared to the lab scale... There are some minor inconveniences, but nothing a bit of forethought can't solve.I have a pile of mixed silver coins, now it will be easy to sort them out by weight.If you deal in coins the scale is very handy. Never buy in the open market without weighing! There lots of counterfeit and "short" coins out there..One caution: Make sure the scale cover is on before removing the battery cover. Otherwise you can accidentally damage the scale by too much hand pressure trying to open the battery cover... You must open the battery cover to activate the batteries by removing the safety tab...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Works as advertised. I have used it now for about two months. Be sure to move the line side ways when rewinding. Keep the line form jamming..The line is strong. I use it on the back enclosed patio for bed sheets (one set at a time)works fine. I use the line for all of my stuff to save using the dryer. Power and gas is getting expensive. The girls still use the dryer because girl stuff has to dried a certain way (I guess).A nice side note: The line retracts and is hidden when not in use. It is illegal to have an outside line where I live, go figure that in the days of high energy costs.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I replaced the four 60W (240 Watts total) spot bulbs in the kitchen with the new GE CFLs (4x13W = 52W). The light is beautiful! A nice cool white. I can't detect any noise on my AM kitchen radio (the old CFLs were noisy).AAAAAANNNNDDD, four of the CFLs use less power than one of the old bulbs, WOW!!! $7.95/8,,, Wow again!!!!!Good ole Amazon, If Amazon doesn't have it,, I don't need it...Warning,,, you cannot use this type of bulb in dimmer switch and X10 remote control light circuits. Most X10 switches are dimming and will damage the cfl(I know from experience).The X10 AM466 module should work with CFLs (Amazon). The AM466 module is an on and off switch (not dimming) used with appliances (coffee maker for example). I will test the module when I get it and report back...5/12: I received the AM466 module and replaced the evening timer on/off light with a cfl blub controlled by the module. Works perfectly.FYI: I used a digital micrometer to measure the height of a 60W standard and these cfls. 60W = 108.81 mm and the GE cfl = 120 mm. The cfls will fit in our overhead fan standard globe covered lights. The older cfls required larger globes.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	The issue of Slavery has obscured many historical writings regarding Lincoln. This work explains why Lincoln did not make slavery an issue in the early part of the War.He was an very wise man that did not burn bridges in the political circles of the time. There was an attempt by some to start a war with Europe to divert the succession movement of the South...He side stepped the issue and when his enemies understood what he was doing they became his staunches supporters. It is amazing how the elite of Washington thought of him as a back country rube and they were going to tell him what to do.Lincoln turned the tables on them and when they finally understood they were in the presence of a master politican who understood the world more than they did, the truly intelligent ones became Lincoln's disciples.Come back to us ABE we need you more than ever! The War between Darkness and Light has begun and millions of souls are going to die....
A1AH8033GWKBY7	0	0	The main character is a yuppie bum, whose family parks him in the church to get rid of him... He is an atheist but pretends to believe in the church to get by..The exorcism exercises leave much out and really is just yuppie nonsense.. They had to enlist Anthony Hopkins in the movie otherwise nobody would waste their time to watch it. Anthony must be hard up for money to take a dumb part like this...The better name for this movie would be "Exorcism for Atheists".I watched it on Netflix and it was really just a waste of time...Don't bother...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	It works ok. You must have a straight edge on the roll bags. Cutter is a bit cheap but does the job...Saves money to use rolls of bags...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	This book along with Google Earth will give you a lot of information. Be sure to check medical info on the Islands...
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I had an old unused XT computer so just for fun, I loaded Ubuntu Linux on it (very easy, go to the Ubuntu web site and download it for free), (Amazon has lots of books on Ubuntu). A good one for beginners is "The Ubuntu Beginners guide"; .99 for Kindle.Linux is free and has tons of free applications and most are GUI. Oh yeah, Ubuntu works great in a WiFi environment. It even prints on my WiFi printer. Much easier to set up than Windows.. There is a complete free Office package that I like better than Microsoft Office. Oh one more neat thing is no virus and malware checkers are necessary.. Firefox and others run great on it. Foxie has many of the same addons as fox windows.One program that really stands out is "Stellarium". This is an astronomy program that displays the location and dynamic movement of the stars and galaxies across the sky from any point on our little Earth. Even the constellations are mapped out. I didn't realize that the majority of the points of light in the night sky are galaxies. The program has a vast star catalog that you can download. The program has a pointer that will give detailed information about each point of light and many that are not visible.Ubuntu has opened new doors in computing. It requires very little in op resources. After looking at a demo of Windows 8, I may say goodbye to Windows.This makes reading the book extremely interesting. One thing I like about the book is that it has no modern Political Correctness nonsence in it. You can go to the locations described in the book and look for yourself at the stars.The book, the Star program, and the Linux Ubuntu op system is all free. What more can you ask?
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	I had a coin separator just like this one for 20 years. The major problem was the "C" batteries would come loose in the holder. Tape fixed that problem. The old machine finally wore out.This new machine has several improvements over the old one. The major one is it is operated by a slide switch instead of a coin pressure switch which jammed often and ran the batteries down.The coin separator wheel is designed much better. The old one would put too many coins on the ramp and they would jam.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	Rack arrived on time. No dings in packaging. All parts were present with extra nuts and bolts, which came in handy later.All metal parts of the Rack were electro-painted with no drips or smears. The only hard part of the installation was locating the rafters in a finished garage (why can't someone make a center stud finder that is 100% accurate). Once found, instructions were followed on installing the lag bolts. Hanging the rack was a piece of cake. In my high ceiling garage, when hung at max length, I could stand under the rack.The supports come partially assembled. Make sure the nuts are screwed on so as not to fall off. I lost a bolt and nut that way. There were replacements in the spare parts.The only problem I found is the wire shelf corner bolts are too long and stick out just enough to rip your scalp if you walk under them. A soft plastic bolt cover would be nice.Love it, looks very neat and clean. Now that I know how much space it takes I am going to order more racks.
A1AH8033GWKBY7	1	1	My old Genvaila pot died on the weekend and I have a stainless steel peculator (Amazon) that makes great coffee. A bit of a pain to load but well worth it. Grandma's old peculator on the wood cook stove made fantastic coffee on the farm post WW2. I started drinking coffee at nine y (Hot milk right out of the cow is pretty good also). But a dripper is more practical in today's kitchens.So I found one on Amazon. The reviews on different makers is great. I refuse to play the Wallymart hide and seek game.Arrived on time, considering holiday traffic, that is a wow..Very impressed with the pot. It came with a reusable copper filter, nice, But I prefer the paper #4 brown filters. The best thing of all is the fact that power spikes will not cause it to lose programming, wow!The filing hole is a bit clumsy, but wallymart has a set of cooking funnels cheap, that solves that problem. The coffee pot cover is a snap on, not on a hinge, another clumsy, but no big deal. The pot has a removable water filter that might help if you have crappy water. I didn't install it, we have an osmosis system.Yea, you can program off time from 2 to 4 hours. It is very easy to program, just read the well written instructions. There is 1-4 cup button for small amounts, but not sure how it works. We do ten cups every morning. Also another button for cleaning? I never clean coffee pots the older they get the better the coffee.Ran a pot of clean water through to wash out the plastic oils. The first pot was pretty good. The auto on worked great. The buzzer at the finish was nice. The coffee was hot but not too hot. For drip coffee it came out good. But I think the perky pot is better and the coffee is hot enough to take the hair off a brass monkey. When I want really great coffee, I'll get the perky pot out...
A1AHJ692N0UTNU	1	1	These worked as advertised! I still think the best ones are the Crown Skinless Condoms but I wanted to try these out just too see and yeah they make u last longer than usual. They didn't break or anything either so I will purchase these again but not for everyday use, my Crowns are for that, these will be if I need to be a superstar lololol Go Buy these4 Stars because nothing is perfect, I would have gave a 4 1/2 but no option
A1AHJ692N0UTNU	1	1	I bought used on here for like 5 bucks the Blu Ray version and they're was not a scratch on this disc at all!! VENOM IN BLU RAY LETS GO!! LOL
A1AHJ692N0UTNU	0	0	I would not recommend this product. It is not what I ordered. What I got shipped was Stutz 10000 in a black bottle and its like a aerosol spray. It has a bad/ perfume like smell to it and does not numb..I tested on my hand. I WILL NOT BE SPRAYING THIS ANYWHERE! lol!
A1AHJ86AFOOK28	1	0	Nietzsche was not a systematic thinker and so it is very difficult to construct a book on his difficult thought. Deleuze has, however, successfully accomplished that. A combined reading of this work and Pierre Klossowski's "Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle" would provide an understanding of Nietzsche that is well beyond what is presented in most books on the author. It is sad, but we english speakers have collectively written most of the bad literature on Nietzsche. It was the french after WWII that picked-up the mantle set forth by Nietzsche after the embarrassing abuse of his thought by the Nazis.
A1AHJ86AFOOK28	0	1	Lecercle has written other works that at least deserve a read but this particular book is probably not one of them. Amazingly, Lecercle picks the best quotes from Deleuze but has them pointed in the wrong direction. His continual talk of metaphor in Deleuze misses the subtley of Deleuze's work. The greatest crime however is the complete reduction of Guattari to that of another instance of the machine Deleuze. Guattari's value to Deleuze seems to always be reduced and it is to everyone's loss. If one would read Guattari before he met Deleuze everything in the &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; (at least that on language) is already present. The same cannot be said of Deleuze who was still to much of structualist and Lacanian before he met Guattari.
A1AHJ86AFOOK28	1	1	The only other review of this book is just so sad. So Zizek was mistaken about the WMD because we have found sheels that may have sarin gas residue. Don't you think that Bush and the rest of the team would be screaming about this all day, everyday but they have remained strangely silent. There are problems with this book. Zizek has a tendency to use the same stories and jokes over and over agian. But this does not take away from his ability to critize both the right and pseudo-Left position on the war. He also does a quite amazing job moving from the particular to the theoretical. But his shing moment appears in the formation of a question. The question is not &quot;Are Iraqis better off without Saddam?&quot; but &quot;Is the world better off with the new logic that led to his fall?&quot;
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	What a great collection of stories. I have never read any other Maeve Binchy books, but this one was recommended to me because, well, Christmas has not always been my fav. The stories are all around the idea that the build up does not equal the end result and that sometimes the holidays are just yucky. Some characters have experiences that are better than their usual, just not the picture perfect ideal. I thought they were well written with great characters and interesting situations. It wasn't depressing, just real. A few stories were actually inspirational to a person like me who knows that perfection does not happen just because you wish for it. Sometimes there is just movement towards better. Really, a nice collection.
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	I read this book to prepare lessons for my 6th grade classroom. We were learning about the Terezin Ghetto that was open during WWII in preparation for attending the play I Never Saw Another Butterfly. The book is a collection of poems and visual artwork that were done by Jewish prisoners who were held in this ghetto, mostly by children. The history of the ghetto is amazing and something I was never aware of until I read this book. My students were silent as they read and responded to the poems. We also read large parts of The Cat with the Yellow Star as we studied these poems. The Cat with the Yellow Star is an autobiography of a girl who was in the ghetto and was published in 2007. It helped to round out our understanding of the messages in the poems.
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	This is a tough book. In the beginning the main character, a Palestinian girl, is just realizing she has lost her father. Throughout the rest of the book she is realizing she may soon lose her brother to the dangerous anti-Israeli activities he engages in. The story is strictly told from the Palestinian point of view. The mother in the story introduces the idea of antiviolence as she explains to her son that Islamic Jihad was the group that killed his father, through their actions toward Israelis. There is a bird the main character uses as comfort and as a symbol of flying away from her world of violence. It is an engaging book. If I were to use it with my classes, I would need to be sure both sides of the conflict were presented.
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	Christopher Paul Curtis is becoming a favorite of mine. This book is beautiful. I wanted to cry in the beginning and my heart felt full at the end. He gives a nice talk at the end of the audiobook about how two of the characters are fashioned after his grandfathers. The book is set in the Depression and focused on a boy named Bud.
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	Linda Barry is a favorite of mine ever since seeing her comics in the free local paper. She is offbeat and next to not funny at all in her strip. Her characters are kids who are not at all your average well adjusted variety. I appreciate her honesty in how things really are/can be. I like her characters and feel a connection with them.This novel was so very painful. At times I tried to read faster to get through reading all the pain that happened to the protagonist. I had to remind myself it was fiction. I have read reviews that say this book goes so far as to be funny at times. My brain can't make that leap. Lynda Barry is amazing. However, the pain in her strips is easier to take, in the short bursts of it. This novel requires endurance, at least by me. I am glad to have read it. I do have to say, she made me fall in love with the child who spoke the story.
A1AHM4VME7OMO4	1	1	Um, wow. This story is mostly about a 9 yr old boy who has lost his father in the 2001 terrorist attacks in NYC. There are stories of many other blended into his, mostly that of his grandparents. The other stories are about the people he meets along his healing journey. I found the boy character to be so lovable as to be real, a misfit only child from a loving family. There were parts that were heart breaking and parts that were laugh out loud funny. An amazing story about people and their quirks, and love, and pain.I listened to it and found the narration to be highly enjoyable. As always, the print experience may be different.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	Got this for finding those 'bad-dog' spots in the house--it worked! The black bodied light is the one you want for this purpose because it has the 370nM UV lights that seem to work better for finding urine. Remember not to look directly into the LEDs when you are using the UV emitters. UV exposure can damage your eyes. I also purchased a pair of UV-blocking goggles, which may be overkill, but is erring on the side of safety.High build quality. Why not 5 stars? Price a bit high, the Xenon bulb is only medium bright by today's standards, and it's a big light, with 3 C cells in it.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	My toddler loves this light. It's a wonderful nightlight and "calming" device for a toddler who isn't sure she wants to go to sleep. A variety of changing colors to keep her occupied as she gets sleepy. It shuts itself off after a few minutes so it doesn't run down the batteries. Seems durable, too. If something were to happen to mine I'd replace it immediately--I can't live without it.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	This is a good gun. Need to get the settings right; they are not adjusted from the factory at all. Here's what worked for me, after MUCH experimentation, when spraying Zar Ultra Max Urethane.'X' marks the spot:AV (Air Volume) at bottom of gun:Open / Down / Increase 0 - - - 1 - - X 2 - - - Closed / Up / DecreasePA (Pattern Adjust) on left of gun:Open/CCW 0 - - - 1 X - - 2 + Closed/ClockWFC (Fluid Control) at upper back:Open / Out /Increase 0 - - - 1 - - - 2 - - - 3 - - - 4 - - - 5 - - - 6 - - - X - - - 8 - - - 9 - - - Close/DecreaseRegulator on gun: 45 to 50 psi, and on the compressor itself, 95-100 psi (see mfgr's recommended limits for the gun).
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	Using this book, I have tutored students for less than an hour, and have then watched their paper scores go from "C" grades to "A" grades over the course of a week or two. It can dramatically improve one's writing. I still recommend this book to my college students, even though I don't teach writing anymore.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	0	0	Lots of people purchase this product as a ratchet lubricant. My review pertains ONLY to that use. While it smooths out the ratchet considerably, it does ooze quite a bit, leaving red gooey stuff all over the box or drawer--thus the lowered rating for a ratchet lube. I no longer use this product for ratchets; I use a competing product based on lithium grease.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	A presenter needs a watch rugged enough for extended abusive travel, that has an alarm, and is simple enough to almost "read itself" as you take a nano-second glance at it during your presentation. After months of searching, this is the watch that met those requirements. Additional plus is that the titanium doesn't arouse the interest of the airport metal detectors.Owned it for a year without a hitch. If something were to happen to it I'd immediately replace it with another just like it. Quality Canadian made.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	This small mill has a big following among the home shop machinist crowd (both US and international) due to its unique "small-medium" size, its reputation for decent quality and good durability, and its square column which makes it a much easier machine to mill with, compared to a mid-sized round-column mill-drill which must be re-trammed whenever the head is raised or lowered. It has a surprisingly good envelope size for its weight. Buy a machine with double its weight, and you might get another inch or two in the X, Y, and Z directions.The X3 is considered a benchtop mill at 360 lbs, and has gained a loyal following, despite being snubbed by serious machinists who own 2000 lb Bridgeports and the like. It's manufactured by the Chinese firm Sieg, and its official name is the Sieg X3, but it's rebadged and sold by Grizzly (and used to be sold by HF but no more). The Grizzly rebranded models are often recommended, because Grizzly is thought to have more strict quality control procedures than some other importers. Sieg also makes the Super X3 model (Grizzly calls it the G0619) which adds some electronics and a tilting head. Sieg also makes two smaller mills, the X1 and the X2. Recently Sieg created the full-CNC version of the X3 called the KX3. There's a considerably larger X4 in the works, I think around 700 lbs, sort of a Rong-Fu 45 type machine. There are active Yahoo groups devoted to the X3 and the SX3 mills, including "Sieg-SX3-C6B," "X_Series_Mills," and "X3_small_mill." You can also find some Sieg owners at the Home Shop Machinist forum. But don't try to discuss this mill at the Practical Machinist forum; they won't discuss Chinese-made mills. Rather than write a lengthy review of my own, take a look at the many thoughtful reviews that can be found at the above groups, and what you can find with a simple web search on the name "Sieg X3."If you are looking at this machine, you are probably comparing it to the SX3 and the RF-45 (or clone thereof) because you have "space issues." It took me a long time to make my choice; I finally went with the X3 for a variety of reasons, such as higher spindle speed, longer quill extension, and its lack of "extra" electronics. So doing, I gave up the SX3's tilting head, 1/4 more HP, and electronic displays. And the RF-45, nice as it is, is twice the weight.If you will be moving this machine around yourself (and you probably will), spend some time preparing for the move. I bit the bullet, sistered the joists in my garage, and installed a reinforced lift point directly over the bench where the X3 sits; this has made life with the mill a whole lot more bearable, and the mill much easier to work on.I consider the G0463 to be almost a kit. To get it in good condition, you really want to take it apart, clean it, adjust the split nuts, stone the ways and mating points, lubricate, etc. Search the internet for "X3 Preparation Guide" for help. I am sorry to say I had to send my first X3 back to Griz because its column was leaning so that the mill was out of registration by over .010 in just 5 inches of vertical travel. The second I received was *much* better and is less than .001 over 5" after adding a .002 shim under the right side bolts. So when you get yours, be sure to check "tram" on your machine by setting up an accurate angle plate on the table, and then raise the Z axis as you run the DTI along the face of the plate. If the column is leaning one way or the other you'll need to pull the registration pins at the base (insert a 4mm screw to pull them) and then cut various shims until you get it right. Even better, lift the head and column and get that mating joint flat and clean. Note that you need to do this angle-plate measurement before you sweep the table with an indicator. (That's because the indicator-sweep method doesn't detect the possibility of the head being rotated to compensate for a non-plumb column.)A machine with lots of advantages for the space-conscious, but also expect to dedicate several days to set it up, if you are concerned about accuracy. Some folks are not, and just use it as it comes. To each his own. I am happily making chips on mine, and have completed several projects already.EDIT June '10: All good so far, and have just ordered the Griz 6" rotary table. This mill is very handy and I wonder how I made do without it.EDIT December '10: Still very happy with it. This is becoming my favorite machine in the shop. It can solve so many problems!EDIT Aug '11: I'm still very happy with the machine. I think it's my favorite machine in the shop. Not the highest quality, but so useful I can overlook the rough edges.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	0	1	Grizzly gave themselves such great reviews on this mobile base that I was fooled into purchasing one. (I usually purchase HTC bases). I hate this mobile base, it's really bad. First, compared to HTC bases, this Grizzly base has big, obtrusive outriggers for the wheels, that you are constantly tripping over. (On HTC bases the wheels are close set to the frame.) Second, they left the outriggers sharply square, and you WILL catch your ankle on one sooner or later. Man is that painful! If you buy one, be SURE to round the corners on those nasty square wheel mounts with a grinder. Finally, the magnet system for the leveler pads is weak. The leveler pads will fall down during rolling, obstructing your ability to roll over even the smallest unevenness of surface.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	0	Too bad Amazon doesn't give Country of Origin information. I looked long and hard for a non-Chinese chain hoist and found this Jet (and all of the L-90 series) is actually Japanese manufacture, so purchased one. Will update this review when it arrives.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	This is an excellent tool. The leverage it generates is incredible...if you need to hold something tight, this tool will do it! Works great for plumbing, when you need a really big wrench, but not bulky like an adjustable. Also works quickly (while the water is flowing everywhere) because of a sort of ratcheting action...you'll understand once you try it...it doesn't actually ratchet, but you can spin a nut very quickly, with a quick grip and release motion, much more quickly than with an adjustable "Crescent" style wrench.I like it so much I've now purchased 3 of them. The largest one gives you the most bang for your buck IMO.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	0	0	Sounds like this has the same user interface as the Hello Kitty version of same. The user interface is just downright befuddling...all these extra keys you have to press to get it to send text...you press SEND, but before sending it asks you "P/I?" to which you respond "ICQ CALL"... does any of this make sense? I think buying my kid a telegraph key and teaching her Morse Code would be somewhat easier. I plan to return mine and get something else for an Xmas present for my kid.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	I can't believe the mediocre reviews this router has gotten because "the bits won't release." It is true that upon loosening the collet, you can't just pull out the bit, as with larger routers that have larger collets with multiple relief cuts. With this sort of collet (which has a single relief cut), you need to loosen the nut with the supplied wrench, then tap on one of the faces of the collet nut two or three times, and most bits will then slide right out. On occasion, you'll find a bit that needs three taps, then turn the nut 180 degrees, and tap the OTHER side 3 times. I've never had a bit that wouldn't release after the tap-3-rotate-tap-3 method, which takes what, two seconds? For me, not a big deal. Keep your vice grips and your horror stories in the toolbox--they're not necessary.Otherwise, small, light, powerful, and sturdy. I wanted a solid no frills base, and like this one, with its split-thread design that allows you to easily remove the base, and replace it, and have the micro-adjust working instantly. (I sometimes remove the base and use it as a cut-out tool or a "super dremel.") However alternate bases are available--tilt, and offset.I agree with the previous reviewer who noted it would be nice if a step-down collet were included, so this unit could take 1/8" shank bits also. However these are available aftermarket.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	0	1	Compared to my MSA bump cap, this ERB bump cap has no occipital strap (a strap that rides under the protrusion at the back of the skull). That means it relies on tightness around the circumference of the head alone, to stay on. Knocks off more easily than a baseball cap. Just not secure enough.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	1	I installed two other brands of safety gates and was thoroughly frustrated with them...one in particular required both hands to operate (meaning I had to set down everything I was carrying to operate the gate), yet my young child figured out how to defeat it easily!Finally I tried the Kidco Safeway and...it just works. Easy for an adult to get through, tough for a kid to defeat, easy to install, all metal, sturdy, and low profile.At one point we moved and I lost an essential piece of hardware for the gate. I called Kidco, they shipped it quickly and at no charge. How rare is that? Kudos to this company.
A1AHSLKOKA3MC3	1	0	Fan of Plano plastic boxes. I go out of my way to buy Plano...the plastic is tough and feels quality. Never had problems with Plano boxes opening by accident. And they aren't difficult to open like the plastic boxes sold by HF.
A1AHVGA96GP0GM	0	1	This toy would be great, if only it stayed together. I got it for my 2 1/2 yr. old. The farris wheel comes off so easily, you could blow it off. The rest of it isn't much better. I need some really strong glue.
A1AHVGA96GP0GM	1	1	I love that there is only one piece. No little parts to get all over the house. And no batteries. I love things that are neat, easy, and simple to understand for my preschoolers.
A1AI0T54817QAU	1	1	I bought this machine (Hobart Handler 140) more than a year ago and have put it through its paces. It comes with the regulator, switch and hose so you only need the tank. Of course you can use flux core without the tank. Remember that you can get away with welding stainless with Argon but Trimix or an Argon/CO2 mix it recommended. I already had a helmet etc. so another $120 for a new full R40 Argon tank and I was MIG welding aluminum.This is a fully functional MIG welder that runs on 115V (20 amps) current. It is well made and I haven't had any problems with durability or malfunctions, it is quite reliable in that respect. It is quite portable and I like the safety switch which is only live when you're actually welding. I also called support once (about the liner) and they were prompt and helpful. It does have one tiny annoyance that the door latch is made of plastic and doesn't usually latch properly, but since the door hangs down when closed anyway, it really doesn't matter.I've welded various thicknesses of mild steel, Stainless and Aluminum with it and, for the most part, it has performed as advertised. I've also used both the 1lb roles and the 10lb rolls. One tiny problem, the spring is a bit too long on the small rolls and you have to put the lock nut for them on backwards in order to get low enough friction if you're using aluminum wire.The machine does indeed weld 3/16" steel in one pass if you go very slow and have a smooth technique. If you are looking for something to weld heavy steel often, get a stick welder for half the money, or move to a 220 machine that will run heavier wire. With respect to heavy steel, I wanted this machine just for occasional smaller welds and it delivers there. On light sheet, it is like a glue gun for metal and fully in its element. It comes with Miller type tips but I actually prefer the shorter, flat nosed, Lincoln tips (which fit perfectly) for steel.I've also welded a lot of stainless in the 12-18 ga range with it and it has been great at that as well.Welding aluminum with this machine, as with every MIG except a spool gun in this power range, is a tedious process. On thinner material, you need to be very fast and very smooth. On thicker material, it can be really good IF you have good karma, think happy thoughts and have everything right - see below. If you're buying it primarily to weld aluminum though - this is not the appropriate class of machine for you. Depending on what you want to do, look for a 220 machine with intelligent speed control, or a TIG, or even a henrob torch or Al "brazing" rods. No matter how good you are, it is a pain and you'll end up with at least a few bird's nests per project with this machine.How to weld heavier aluminum with this machine.1. use a .045 tip. The machine only takes .030 aluminum wire and they recommend a .035 tip for aluminum but it isn't big enough. You really need to move to the .045 tip for aluminum or you aren't going to weld more than a couple of minutes before you start a bird's nest factory. Tips are only about a buck a piece.2. Keep the gun hose very straight, especially on the machine end. This is tedious and difficult sometimes but it makes a big difference.3. Use 5 series wire (e.g. 5356 - app. $5/lb. from several online sources like weldingsupply) instead of the 4043that you see at home depot or harbor freight. Especially at the highest amperage, the 4043 is virtually unuseable in this machine (at least without a lot of headaches), even with the nylon liner. One annoying thing is that the 5356 is harder to feed near the end of the role and will be more prone to kinking. The 5356 does seem to require a slight bit more heat so you need to always push the weld and go slow on thicker material - ideally with the material flat. This machine rates at 5-10 amps more than the other machines on the market (140 vs. 130-135). It doesn't sound like much of an advantage but I read elsewhere that you can't get penetration with the 5356 in 115V machines and that just isn't true with this machine. I have a 450 gal 1/8" aluminum hot tub to prove it.4. Use a nylon liner if you plan to weld a lot of aluminum. They are $17-$25, mine is from Miller. Also make sure that it is perfectly cut and aligned to the drive wheel.5. Make sure that the aluminum is very clean.In general, it is a good machine with good support and versatility. In its niche, it is a very good choice in relation to the other brands. I don't give it all the stars really only because they should be a bit more up front in their advertising that while it does weld aluminum, the machine (like others in its class) really isn't a great choice for that.
A1AI0T54817QAU	1	1	I bought this grinder more than a year ago and have used it weekly with periods of daily use. It is an 8.5 amp, 10K rpm single speed machine and one of my favorite tools. I'll admit it. I don't treat it nicely. The guard was set aside the first day I used it. I now generally keep a 5" grinding wheel on it and it does eat them quite voraciously but that's its job. I also have a third party sanding back (from Home Depot) that is nice for finishing metal or roughing wood. I've also used the flap sanding wheels but they are a bit pricey. I like the spindle lock on it because you can reach it with your thumb, thus allowing the replacement of wheels without tools for some people.The only time that it has ever failed me was my fault for putting it in the vise (by the body). It refused to turn on. When I took the case off to see what was wrong I noticed that I had pinched the cable connecting the brush to the motor and it had jammed the brush. A quick flick and the brush popped back in its place and all has been well since.I have had it running for as long as 4 hours straight and it just continues to run without complaint. The lock on the switch is plastic and is starting to show a tiny bit of wear but it still works so I'm not complaining. I've ground down hundreds of ugly welds, sharpened a lot of drill bits and chainsaw blades, and cut off a lot of heavy steel bars, bolts etc. I've never stalled it, it has scads of power.Basically, I've given it a good workout and it is still going strong. Enough said.
A1AI0T54817QAU	1	1	I bought this sander about 6 months ago and have used it on several projects ranging from composite board bookshelves, to an aluminum hot tub, to an Oak enclosure for the hot tub. It has really done well on everything. I would likely use a harder pad on Aluminum if I were doing a lot of it but the OEM pad was perfect for the hardboard and Oak. The sander cuts well and is balanced well enough to produce a nice flat surface or finesse a perfectly rounded edge.The 6" paper is harder to find than the more common 5" and you don't usually see the same kind of selection or volume discounts on it locally - although Grizzly does sell both in bulk. Hook and eye paper is a bit more expensive than sticky paper but it wears so much better, and I really like being able to use a disk half way and pull it off to use a different grit, then reuse it later.This is definitely not a detail sander and doesn't cut like a belt sander but it was a good tradeoff for me. The front handle is removable but really doesn't stick out enough to be a problem. I had a minor problem with the detachable handle getting loose but simply removing it completely and re-installing it fixed that. The threads may have been dirty. I tried a few similar sanders before buying this one. It isn't the brute that the Milwaukee is and it isn't as petite as the Hitachi. I needed something in the middle and opted for this one and it works. My shop has open sides so dust collection isn't usually an issue but a major failing on many sanders like this is the dust collection and I have to comment that the dust collection on this thing actually works very well and doesn't get in the way. It is a good tool.
A1AI0T54817QAU	1	1	OK I'm updating this review again and I'm happy with the rating.I bought this from ToolsbyNet through Amazon and for under $180 with shipping = a great deal I thought. I saw the same model on online auctions for $70 more and just got a catalog from a major discount tool house in which it is $349.As I said originally, it's a great drill and appears to be very heavy duty except for the side handle which I don't use anyway. The only real problem arose after a year of occasionally driving screws and other medium duty work when I decided to try the hammer drill feature and drill some 1/2" holes in my concrete floor. It worked great for about 3 inches and then stopped. The motor overheated I think and just clicked for at least a couple of hours afterward when I tried it. A few days later, I cleaned it out and tried again and everything seems to be fine. If it was just overheating then it is probably good that it shut down but overheating after only 3 inches of concrete doesn't seem to be very heavy duty. New update: it died again. New update II: it has been another year now and a lot of hard use, no failures. One person commented that it must have been the batteries but I have two and tried both so it is not that. In any case whatever the hiccups were, I think that they are over and I really like the drill.
A1AI0T54817QAU	0	0	I bought this in 2006 and it worked as advertised, taking about 20 charges over 18 months, then it got to the point where it would last only a minute or two and then wouldn't take a charge at all. Stay away from this one if you want it for more than a year.
A1AISB4FU33CNY	0	0	(Spoilers, I'm afraid, for this one.) I really did enjoy Season One, even more than Downtown Abbey, which was its main competitor. But oh my sainted aunt; oh my paws and whiskers! What DID they do with Season Two? The characters are simply unrecongizable and the narrative goes from realistically uplifting to quite unbelievable trash.Hallum changes, with no warning, from a noble person with brilliant international insights to an idiot so enslaved to his nether regions that he sleeps with his sister-in-law and allows her to extract information for the Nazis, toward whom she is still sympathetic; Percy goes from being an understandably confused and spoiled adolescent to practically a psychopath. When it finally looks like Pritchard, that kind man, finds love, it is ripped away and he descends into alcoholism; the driver, who had rejected his Nazi leanings, now becomes a blackmailer and potential deserter; Beryl, who had begun to respect her mistress for her better understanding of the servants' situation, turns spiteful. And Eileen Atkins, alas, is put on the shelf (literally) and replaced by her sister--a very sensible, endearing, and wise woman, who, it is clearly implied, has romantic preferences for her own gender (stereotypically very male clothing, etc). Hardly unusual, but here it has to be drawn out and detailed explicitly with a lost lover and a bedroom scene or two. With all this, throw in a botched abortion, equally detailed, and the series becomes, as Lady Agnes puts is so succinctly in the end, "a sordid affair." Not that these issues should have been ignored, but it seems a great deal of valuable narrative time was was wasted on drawing them out melodramatically as a suddenly major focus--while viewers, I suspect, were wondering how the children refugees were doing, the step-daughter at school, etc., all of which were just dropped.Johnny, the likable footman lad, and the sweet housemaid with glasses, seem to be the only two who stay their kind and believeable selves (though Johnny is listed as 1-A for conscription, so of course such a good-hearted and outdated character will be killed in the war), along with Hallum's disabled sister, who makes a couple of charming appearances. At least the Indian manservant and the cook stay sensibly level-headed, while everyone else devolves into raving bonkers and you wonder if they will all be carted off to Bedlam Hospital. Agnes, in the end, decides, unselfishly, for the sake of the children and her household, to stay with her husband; but her love for Hallum, now esquery for the Duke of Kent after resigning his position at Whitehall, is extinquished.The last scene, with guns, attempted murder, and suicide--all neatly swept up by the returning Pritchard with an amazing lack of emotion for what has just happened--approaches farce; and is such a sad contrast to the first scene in the series, where the children's refugee home is established. The very fact that a viewer can actually sit through this second series until the end is due entirely to the truly brilliant actors, who had very little material to work with. It is almost as if the scriptwriters were taking their revenge for the series not being continued. Poor Jean Marsh; they really ruined her revival in Series Two. We wish her the very best in her recovery from her stroke, but I doubt the second series will help. She is a genius; these writers were, alas, not.
A1AJAD2B9K0DMV	1	1	I like it. Fits a lot of stuff. Great for a 3-day weekend or lugging around stuff to a pickup game at the park. Ball compartment doubles as a bike helmet pocket (at least for me). Nice idea right? I think so. Good bag overall. No problem with shipping.
A1AJAD2B9K0DMV	1	1	Just the right size. Soft and comfortable shape. Hits all the right spots. Instantly does it's job ;-) Waterproof. Does not have a bad synthetic smell (it actually has a nice sugary scent). I am very happy with this purchase. I'm surprised that I am the first one here to post a review. I'm sure the next ones would also be positive reviews.
A1AJAD2B9K0DMV	0	1	I got it in medium based on a previous reviewer saying that she is 125 lbs and around 5'2" (which is my height and my weight), and the medium size is too loose! The waist band goes up way too high, I think I can pull it over my chest if I wanted to, so I'd wish it were lower waisted. The leg length is too long, and these are tights, it's not like you can fold them if they're too long. I didn't bother returning them. I might give it away to someone else. But the material seems pretty thick, but can get see-through if stretched.
A1AJAD2B9K0DMV	1	1	This bag is the perfect size for my Panasonic Lumix GF1 camera. The GF1 is a digital camera with an interchangeable lens. It is smaller than a DSLR because it got rid of the mirror box and optical viewfinder, so the design is ultra compact, but the picture quality is pro-level. This bag fits the camera body and the 14-45mm lens. If you have the pancake lens as well, it will fit in there too. There are pockets to place memory cards, spare batteries, lens cleaning paper, etc. In storage, I put the charger and other cords in there. It comes with a built-in all-weather cover (to cover the bag during extreme weather), but the packaging says that the outside lining of the bag itself is already water resistant, so the included weather cover is a plus. I'm happy with the bag. It is constructed well, and it feels sturdy enough to protect my camera during travel.
A1AJAD2B9K0DMV	1	0	I bought this last year for my Vespa along with an OnGuard chain. I do street parking. I loop the heavy chain through the back wheel (recommended by the Vespa Store) because it is harder for thieves to remove the back wheel, then I loop the chain around a pole and lock it with the OnGuard Boxer 5047 lock. This morning when I unlocked it, I noticed that it was scratched up bad, like someone was trying to cut it. But it was mostly surface scratches. So this thing is tough! If it weren't for this (and the OnGuard chain), my Vespa would have been stolen off the streets of Washington, DC. See customer pictures, I will upload some.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	0	0	Since when did Darwin look like Fabio--what is with the hair?The portrayal of Emma Darwin was insulting: the doting, concerned wife with no real understanding of what Charles was doing ("What is it, Charles?"). In fact, Emma was a genius who spoke several languages and helped edit Darwin's texts.The only good thing I can say is that it was nice to see Down House; and the opening scene in which Darwin receives Wallace's paper and promptly throws up was nice too.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	0	0	Only the desperate can watch five seasons of this dreadful show. The sensation of warm brains drooling out my ears was wonderful.A better title for Angel would be "The Lonely Losers No Luck Club".The tired theme is "LA is Hell and lawyers are demons".Two good episodes out of five seasons from my estimate.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	1	Herzog makes a Lynch film and the hybrid is bizarre. Not one of Herzog's finest films but still offers images unseen. Ostriches, flamingoes, guerilla filmmaking, and a midget. Utter madness.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	1	The adventures of the 7th Doctor and Ace are some of my favorite Doctor Whos of all. Silver Nemesis throws the kitchen sink at you: a living metal statue, a witch from the 17th century, Cybermen, and Neo-Nazis. What's going on? Ask until the end and you still won't know--how can someone write like that? Doctor What the hell was that? I love the older Who shows for their lack of story continuity and sheer nonsense story-telling.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	1	Apparently, the episode "Threshold" (ST: VOY, Season 2, Ep. 11) is regarded by many Star Trek fans as one of the worst episodes ever, and some fans have even gone so far as to suggest it be removed from the canon. But this episode fulfills, as no other episode has, the optimistic vision of future evolution. Tom Paris and Captain Janeway are mutated into the far future descendants of humanity into large mudpuppies, living what appears to be a serene life in warm swamp water and breeding happily in tropical jungle. I can think of no better existence. We once were very similar to the creatures portrayed in this episode, and I have always looked back on that existence with a mixture of envy and evolutionary regret. We are now bipedal apes with swollen brains, filled with emotional and rational conflict. The projection of our evolution into these creatures is one of the boldest adventures Star Trek has ever offered. The optimism of such a future state of our species is compelling science fiction. Usually, sci-fi, and especially Star Trek, suggests that we will evolve into beings of pure energy and consciousness after some intermediate version that incorporates technology into our biological being. Instead, "Threshold" offers an alternative, more naturalistic, vision of returning to something much like what we once were hundreds of millions of years ago. I find this alternative vision of our future evolution refreshing and optimistic in the extreme. I would much rather be a mudpuppy than a manifestation of pure energy consciousness. To breathe through my skin again and lie placidly in a warm swamp is the most optimistic future I can imagine.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	0	Of all Herzog's documentaries, this film most closely follows actual events without the director indulging himself in "ecstatic truth"-telling. Neither is he the flat-brained teller of the "accountant's truth." The horror of both the crime and capital punishment need no poetic or operatic treatment. This is not an anti-death penalty film as some have accused. Herzog does state that he is opposed to capital punishment, that he respects human life, but that is as far as he goes. He does not overly empathize with the accused. In fact, his film is dedicated to the victims' families.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	0	Coupland's novel will appeal to the 21st Century geeks as much as it was written about the geeks of the '90s. Anyone who is educated in science and engineering and has had his or her hard-won talents twisted by corporations into slavish poorly compensated labor and the bottom line of company profit will immediately recognize the plight of Coupland's characters. However, Coupland's obvious love of LEGO and belief in the ingenuity and creativity of young geeks give hope for family relationships and the power of friendship in an otherwise digitally meaningless world.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	1	1	"Trash Humpers," in my opinion, is Harmony Korine's best film. He meant it as a comedy, and it does work on that level, but more importantly, "Trash Humpers" is an allegory for the 21st Century and the meaningless search for "freedom" in a world of garbage.We are all "Trash Humpers," mindlessly humping the remains of the American Dream. Like a dog going at a velour beanbag, we rub ourselves raw on the filthy trash of pointless violence, the day-to-day nightmares of existence, and revel in our decadent world falling into economic and environmental ruin."Trash Humpers" is the greatest statement in film, yet made, on the horrors of 21st Century life.
A1AJAHGTH1ILEM	0	0	I have never seen any episodes of the sixth Doctor, but of all the Who I've seen, Jon Pertwee is the absolute worst. He takes himself so seriously that the inherent absurdity of "Doctor Who" is reduced to a ponderous and tedious trial of the senses. His total lack of humor is so at odds with the goofy plots and ridiculous monster costumes that it is impossible for me to enjoy his episodes. I think he saw himself as a "Danger Man" character, and he portrayed the Doctor with all the seriousness that Patrick McGoohan did in his series. "The Mutants," in particular, is so long I couldn't make myself finish it when it got to Part Six. It's not that complex a story, and could have been wrapped up in the conventional four parts--three, if there had been any mercy. Jon Pertwee--worst Doctor ever.
A1AJC545TFC2SL	1	1	In Yurkovich's world, all the superheroes are unionized. All the good ones that is. The main characters are the Philidelphia-based supergroup Threshold. They are not unionized. They are also not a very strong group. Sort of coasting on the reputation from a fight they won a long time ago, they spend most of their time loafing and making snacks.They live in the shadow of more powerful, corporate groups, like the A-list supergroup New York Superhero Syndicate .When Threshold has to fight the supervillain The Stamp Collector, all heck breaks loose. Will they defeat the Stamp Collector before the mayor caves in and signs for the NYSS' medical benefits package?Less Than Heroes is awesome. I bought it at the San Diego Comic Book convention, and got it signed by Yurkovich while he was there! It is great, and so it the Broccoli Agenda!
A1AJC545TFC2SL	0	1	The puffy part completely shredded in my teeth, and even trying to remove it ended up jamming fibers between my teeth and gums. There's not enough to grab to pull out; I had to use another floss product to pull shreds out, one fiber at a time... I can feel it with my tongue behind my bottom teeth. I can't just leave it there because the fibers will collect food and plaque and basically be a rot-sponge.This is torture. It's after midnight and I have to be up in a few hours. I just wanted to clean my teeth!
A1AJGCSB6DBHHA	0	1	I came to this site specifically to purchase MS Streets and Trips 2008. After learning that I can only use it on one computer, I have changed my mind. Like many working/traveling people, I create my routes, maps etc on a desk top at home and use them on a laptop on the road. The one computer restriction is very inconvenient for me and a deal breaker.I am off to research "Plan B"Thank you, everyone, for writing the very informative reviews. You have saved me a little money and a lot of hassle.
A1AJGCSB6DBHHA	1	1	I first bought "How to Master the Art of Selling" by Tom Hopkins in 1993 and then recently purchased the updated version because I am re-entering the world of sales and wanted to see how the author had updated/revised his approach.In my opinion, Hopkins' strongest point is the attention to preparation. He outlines many specific scripts and strategies that are easily adapted to various situations. This is the best "how to" book I have come across.While the fundamentals of selling are still basically the same (perserverence, follow-through, shameless self promotion etc.) the author did a nice job of bringing his approaches into the 21st century.The book is well worth the money, both for the updates and the re-read.
A1AJGCSB6DBHHA	1	1	The Berklee guitar books could very well be the best comprehensive method out there. This is the first of three books. The DVD is a big help because it lets the student hear and see the exercises along with reading them. Anyone who takes the time and exercises the discipline to give the Berklee method adequate attention will emerge an accomplished legitimate guitarist.The Berklee books are geared to the serious student. Those who are looking for a few hot licks to amaze the garage band or the folks at the club should probably look elsewhere.
A1AJGOGL0QAQ4U	0	0	I was kinda looking forward to listening to Madrid. Disc 1 is okay not quite what I expected of a spanish inspired house, but still decent and enjoyable. Disc 2 is a total disaster, it's the type of house that I call "overdone trash". I started listening to the each of the tracks hoping to get some variation of the dull beat to no avail.
A1AJO0RADWSXAD	0	0	I got the right card from Amazon, that must suck for those other people. But, like some of the other people posting, this Delkin card will crash my computer every time I insert it. The ony way to make it work is shut down the computer, insert the reader and the card and boot up. Then everything works OK. This happens on a Dell Laptop and a Macbook Pro 15".
A1AJO0RADWSXAD	0	0	Yes, a AA battery will fit inside this thing.No, a AA battery doesn't last very long compared to a D cell battery.I bought one of these for a baby bouncy seat. AA batteries don't last a day, when Ever-ready rechargable D cell batteries lasted a week or more.Not a product problem by any means, but the whole idea ends up being not so great.If you've got something that takes D cell batteries, probably whoever designed it figured out the smaller, lighter, cheaper AA batteries wouldn't do the job. Don't second guess the designer. Use real D cells.
A1AJO0RADWSXAD	1	1	Some reviewers complain that it's milky. It's actually quite clear, about what you'd expect from thick plastic. Not clear as glass, but certainly what I would call clear and what I would expect.

A1AJP74GZ3OVXF	0	0	Ordered this book with High hopes.......Immediately it became clear that this is just another mistaken person in attempts to define and locate the mind.Statements like "The mind is what the brain does" is SO far off the mark!!!....I recommend that Mr. Pinker read The Implicate Order by David Bohm.I am Certainly not after lofty definitions of the mind....just useful ones.The computational theory of mind misses the mark in a big way.It Almost has an argument viewing from the point of Emergence and the Hierarchy Principle.....almost....But that too misses the mark.....at least you can see why one would give credit to that argument. Mr. Pinker's book...i found to be dull, unimaginative and so far off the mark that i cant believe his position at MIT....it is scary that this is the prevailing thought on the subject. A poor waste of time. Some interesting thoughts and information....but the attempts to tie that into a larger theory makes some pretty wild (and ignorant) assumptions....
A1AJP74GZ3OVXF	0	0	I've heard detailed descriptions of Mr. Bohm's theory before ordering the book. At first....it was Very exciting to start delving into Mr. Bohm's incredible work.But halfway through the book....it was painfully obvious how poorly written this book is!!....Hard to follow..Shabby consistency....NOT friendly reading.I Still have the upmost respect for Mr. Bohm's theory of the implicate/explicate order...just wish this book was written clearly...could have been a facinating exploration.Instead...was a frustrating trip.Too bad....again....Much respect for Mr. Bohm....this book misses the mark though..

A1AJVOZXG8TCT5	1	1	Simply put: you MUST read this book! It's the best I have read in a very long time. You will not be dissapointed.
A1AJVOZXG8TCT5	1	1	I really never wanted to quit smoking. I liked it. A lot. Then my 56 year old dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given 18 to 24 months to live "if the chemo works". Time to quit.Reading this book made me want to quit more than I ever thought possible. It really works.One thing I will say is that you need to keep this book. I have had to go back to it a few times to remind myself why I don't need or like smoking anymore.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	This is another one of those movies that you either love or you hate. I seem to be in the minority. As a fan of musicals I was looking forward to the film, and definitely to the rebirth of the movie musical. I was quite disappointed by this film though. First, it represents everything that is bad about postmodernism. The quick cut editing (a la MTV and Michael Bay) doesn't lend itself to a musical - or at least a traditional musical) and before you say it isn't a traditional musical (which I realize), understand that musicals rely on staging for effect. The director is so quick to change the shot or angle before the audience gets bored that he never allows the actors to truly perform. At times it becomes even cartoonish and while an accurate approximation of a vaudville musical, it's hard to generate any sympathy for Nicole Kidman or to even begin to care about the love story when Baz doesn't care enough to develop the characters beyond two dimensions. With only one original song, the soundtrack sounds like a well done greatest hits of pop songs with elaborate orchestration. Kind of like The Boston Pops does KIIS 97 FM (The best hits of the seventies, eighties, and nineties). While Luhrman certainly has an eye (reminiscent of Terry Gilliam in many ways) it doesn't lend itself to a musical - and without his help this production (as beautiful as it is) collapses under its own weight.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Hey this is the album with the hit Black Metallic. Certainly a milestone in the whole shoegaze movement. Say what you want about Catherine Wheel, they had a pretty cool song with that and that's more than most bands. Though the time for this music has passed and I doubt any new listeners will appreciate what these early nineties bands like Ride or M.B.V. or Catherine Wheel had to offer. Tis more the pity.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	If you aren't a Kinsey fan and you're looking at getting into the series - you should probably start at the beginning. Not that you couldn't enjoy this book by itself. In my opinion, its the best of the books since at least K is for Killer - the series had started to sag once Kinsey's family got involved - and Kinsey is once again in fine form. This time on the hunt for her ex-husband's attempted murderer - the book has a satisfying (yet somewhat contrived) conclusion. With the requisite wit of any Millhoune mystery - this one satisfies, and I'm definitely looking forward to the rest.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Never being a fan of the show and having only seen a few episodes - I went to this movie expecting very little and was pleasantly suprised. As an x-files novice I had absoloutely no problems following the film and found it to be so enjoyable that I started watching the show right away. I bought the DVD and was underwhelmed at the actual content. I know it claims that there is extra footage - but its mixed in with the making of featurette. Still, the movie is worth the price of the DVD and its something that I can watch even when the episodes of the show cease to be interesting. Rob Bowman's direction is spot on - creepy, nice to look at - and much better than his work on the weak Reign of Fire.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Personally, I believe that this movie got a really bad rap when it came out in the theaters. Even Gene Siskel said it was great - he said that James Woods should have been nominated for an Academy Award (and even though he had a brain tumor at the time I don't think that his opinion is any less valid). And it is a really good movie - certainly one of the best Vampire yarns of the 90s (and much better than Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula). Okay, so it does have Daniel Baldwin. But he really isn't that bad. And so what if the ending isn't completely satisfying - that's part of John Carpenter's charm - his movies end without much resolution - it leaves the audience wanting. Plus, you get a great scene of vampires killing a room full of hookers and guys toting guns - slicing one guy in half - and you can't get better than that. May not be one of Carpenter's best - but it is far from one of his worst.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	As a follow up to the first Everything is Nice - this newest of Matador compilations features some pleasant new music to enjoy. Running the spectrum from Pavement with two quite nice songs (including an alternate version of Grounded which is, in many ways, better than the original) to the always pleasing Boards of Canada hit Roygbiv and the flash in the pan Burger/Ink - there is almost certainly something for everyone here. And with three discs for under twenty dollars, it's hard to go wrong with this purchase. I could have done without some of the Arab Strap and Bardo Pond songs - but once again, something for everyone.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Writing a review of this album is like writing a review for Thriller. If you're a fan of the pixies you already own this, if not - you won't be reading the reviews. That said, while this isn't the &quot;best&quot; that the Pixies have to offer, it is certainly the most accessible to non-fans just getting into the Pixies. It was my first album and I had no problem running out and picking up all the rest right away. Granted, this album has most of the hits and even the most in the dark music listener would recognize Debaser or Monkey Gone to Heaven. It's sure no Surfer Rosa - but it really is a crowd pleaser. You can't go wrong with this album.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	If you haven't heard of Jim's journal and you ended up here because as a fan of the Onion you wanted to see what Scott Dikkers once did, then you're in for a pleasant (or unpleasant time) people are completely polarized by Jim - either you love the strip or you hate it. I love Jim. Don't bother buying any of the single collections when you can own the whole Jim Treasury. Also included in this book (and missing from the other stand alone books i.e. I got married, I made some brownies) is an introduction for each of these books in the collection. Plus you get various insight into the characters and strip from Dikkers in some revealing passages that are both laugh out loud funny and kind of sad. If you are a fan of meta comedy - i.e. comedy that is funny because it is done in such a blank fashion that its hard not to laugh - if only for the absurdity of the whole thing - then this book is for you. If the idea of a comic strip where the punchline for a strip is "when I woke up from my nap I was even more tired than I was before" leaves you scratching your head - then you should probably buy some Marmaduke or Garfield. Maybe a collection of Hagar the Horrible would be best. On the other hand, if you like things that don't always make sense - buy this book. You'll love it.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	If you are an Onion fan and you've been wary of buying what you can get for free - I have to tell you that you must be really .... Why not drop ten bucks for a book that has all new Onion stories to enjoy? Now, this isn't one of those stupid books that merely reprints old comic strips ... or stuff that you've seen and then you get home and feel .... No way, this is a book of all new Onion stories - the Onion from 1900 to the present (1 paper per year) with all of the sick and fun parody that the folks at the Onion are known for. ..., this book will help tide you over until the next issue is up online - and you won't feel burned in the process.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Its as good as the worst Smiths album, and that's saying a lot. Has the requisite crowd pleasers like Suedehead and Everyday is Like Sunday. If you already have all of the Smiths stuff and you don't own this album - its definitely worth picking up. However, if you're still listening to the Smiths in this day and age chances are you already own this album.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	An excellent examination of consumer culture and the way that corporate America has tried to deal with, understand, and co-opt youth culture (or did youth culture co-opt advertising?) Frank gets to the bottom of it all in an always entertaining look at advertising from the Madison Avenue years through the sixties. His examinations of various ad campaigns - such as Volvo who insisted in their ads that their cars were ugly and at least not as filled with defects as the cars they used to make - are insightful and well researched. In fact, this book is a necessary primer for anyone doing research on youth culture. It helped to change the way that I think about these issues and has become a text that I refer to often.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	I can't believe that it's been ten years since John Lurie made this series and it still holds up. Great comedy fishing show that isn't over-the-top. Its more crack a smile humor most of the time but certain episodes are clearly made just to make us laugh - the episode with John and Jarmusch comes to mind (every time they show a school of fish they use the sound effect of a bunch of children playing) - and other episodes - such as the one with Tom Waits - are more thought provoking. The locations that are used - Montauk, Vietnam, Canada - are all gorgeous and are far and above any run of the mill fishing show. Even if you aren't into fishing at all - this is the show for you. Its a fishing show that isn't about fishing at all - just a guy hanging out with his celebrity friends and occasionally catching some fish. That is, until he and Willem Dafoe find themselves snowed in and unable to catch anything and they go insane and die. There aren't any fish in that episode.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Like a mixture of Jerry Springer and Candid Camera - Cheaters made me happy to own a television when it premiered in 2000. A classic show that chronicles what must be the wort moment of someone's life. If you like watching people put in uncomfortable situations like being busted cheating on a spouse - and you think that watching someone having to watch a tape of their boyfriend having sex with another girl - then this is the tape for you. However, many people I know just find the show and the whole idea behind it distasteful. While I'm a fan of the show, I think that this DVD may go a bit too far, it becomes pornographic at some points and even slightly disturbing. But if you really enjoy reveling in the pain of others, then this DVD is guaranteed to please.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	A decent EP from the last album from 90s supergroup Pavement. It was nice to see Gary Young show up for what was the group's sad swan song - and this EP leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth. Highlights are Stub your Toe and Malkamus crooning in the cover of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's Killing Moon (also featured on the first Matador anniversary comp.) I could have done without the Casio inspired version of Major Leagues - even with the &quot;You Kiss Like a Rock/ But You know I need it anyway&quot;. In all a good ep - so sad it was their last.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	One has to ask why anyone would want to remake Rollerball in the first place. Aside from the rather interesting James Caan in the starring role, the flat direction by Norman Jewison and the almost laughable story guaranteed this film a place among the greatest cult films ever. Perhaps the makers of this version mistook its cult status for popularity when they imagined that this remake would appeal to today's audience. As if it was an indication of how the film would do, it was pulled from its original release date and "retooled" (Hollywood speak for shelved) before new trailers were made and the film was given a high profile launch earlier this year. It was all for naught, it seems, as this film couldn't be any worse. The DVD version is the R rated cut, giving teen audiences the blood and bare breasts that they missed in the PG-13 theatrical version. The slight glimpses of Rebecca Romjin-Stamos' breasts and some slight gore don't make up for what is ultimately a car wreck of a film, that fails to achieve on any level.Chris Klein stars as Jonathan, the new superstar of Asian supersport Rollerball - the sport of near future kings - a combination of motorcross, Jai A'lai, and roller derby. With a clumsy opening credits sequence wherein an enthusiastic american announcer (played by a guy doing a Rowdy Roddy Piper goes to Pittsburgh accent) explains the rules of the game - we are introduced to our first taste of the sport. That the sport is as chaotic and violent as it is - what with motorcyles and people being hit with metal balls, etc. - it makes one wonder why anyone would bat an eyelash at people being killed during the matches. However, Chris Klein and co. become suspicious when they suspect that fatal accidents are being arranged to help boost ratings (incidentally, in this future a giant scoreboard reports the ratings numbers stock ticker style so the game's owner - played with bored detachment by Jean Reno - can immediately see how these "accidents" help boost the ratings. And, in another odd bit of out there movie reasoning - the second something dangerous happens in the game, these numbers jump by hundreds of millions of viewers (how such a fickle fan base manages to tune in at a moments notice is puzzling - but I digress).As a fan of McTiernan's other films (Die Hard, Die Hard With a Vengeance, Predator, and even the Thomas Crown Affair) I expected that no matter how bad the story was, the Rollerball scenes would be well executed enough to hold my interest. After all, we never liked Die Hard for Reginald Vel Johnson - did we? Alas, it seems that John McTiernan saw the futility of the project and gave up long before shooting began. The action scenes are flashy and flat - sacrificing a well built scene in favor of the quick flash of less than impressive effects and stunt laden glitz. Its almost as if Mc Tiernan handed over control of the film to a second unit director itching to get his hands on a real film. Of course blame should be shared by cinematographer Steve Mason, whose camerawork shows that he doesn't have the imagination to shoot make believe sport films (add rollerball to the equally treacherous BASEketball of a few years back), his lensing of many scenes feels made up on the fly - and many times it doesn't work. This is espescially true of a long nighttime chase sequence shot through a green tinted lens that gives the scene the look of being filmed through night vision goggles. Equal parts distracting and headache inducing, it is one of the worst cases of a crime against cinema in recent memory.Not that the actors do much to help the film along. Chris Klein, bless his heart, is so out of place in a film where it is required that he exhibit emotion or act like anyone other than Chris Klein. It's as if the rest of the cast and crew went along with making the film so as not to make him feel bad. I felt like a parent at a 3rd grade school play, watching someone else's kid butcher the production. Suffice it to say that when L.L. Cool J is forced to carry the film - the film is in trouble.Rollerball is bad. It will never be revered as a piece of bad cinema to be enjoyed on the level of Showgirls or even Ernest goes to Jail. Rather, it will eventually find its way to the [price] reduction bin at [local store] - and even then its probably not a good purchase.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	When I first saw this film in a theater with a broken heater suffering through a 103 degree fever, I believed that it was either a twisted flu triggered dream or one of the most delightfully insane films ever made. After all, could I attribute the presence of a mermaid Russ Tamblyn and a tabacco chewing talking cupcake to anything other than my own cooking brain. It seems that the filmmakers were under the same spell when they made this delightfully hilarious - yet horridly absurd film that has seemed to attract a legion of followers (and an equally strong army of detractors). Showcasing the talent of former Late Night with David Letterman regular Chris Elliot - fresh from the mixed success of his sitcom Get a Life (which managed to survive at Fox until a new head of programming decided he hated the show and vowed to cancel it despite decent ratings in even the worst time slots) - brought his charm to the big screen as a "fancy lad" who signs on as a cabin boy on a ship of crusty seamen after he manages to get the regular cabin boy (a great cameo by Conan O'Brien's own Andy Richter) knocked overboard and killed. Hilarity ensues as Elliot manages to upset the crew in every way imaginable - with absurd results. Full of cameos from favorites like David Letterman and Ann Magnuson - the film coasts through its 80+ minutes with ease, never stopping to try and take itself seriously. Full of extraneous bits of absurd humor and anachronisms galore - the film is like a live action episode of The Simpsons. While most Hollywood films pretend to try and make sense, its nice to have a film like Cabin Boy that completely defies sense. And Chris Elliot is so affable an actor that he manages to bring humor to even the most unfunny scenes. This is one comedy that grows in my esteem with each viewing and I never fail to find something new to laugh at.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Before John Hughes put the sensitive teen film on the map, Bob Clark led another teen revolution in 1982 with his release of Porky's. Based upon his "real" experiences as a teen growing up in the 1950s, the film grossed a staggering 105 million in US rentals and secured its place as one of the most successful comedies of all time - it came in second to Tootsie that year. This DVD release restores the film to its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and provides a rich new print for future generations to enjoy. While not the first film in the teen gross out "genre" - it was certainly a defining film, and its easy to see why. At the time it set the standard for "gross" far outpacing the envelope pushing "Animal House" in terms of bad taste. Much like the influence American Pie had on nineties teen cinema, the influence of Porky's was far reaching.It's sad then, that the sequel wasn't quite up to par. Clark insisted that the sequel was funnier than the first in interviews at the time, adding that the sequel was dealing with important issues while still maintaining the integrity of the original. Alas, while the morality of the first film remains - this time centered around miscegnation and indecency in a production of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream (the correlation to be made between the character's defense of the Shakespeare play against the upset moral majority and Clark's defense of the original Porky's is hard to miss) - the T & A that the first film deftly delivered to the pimply masses is missing. Subsequently, the moral message makes the film more preachy than fun, and the normally acceptable carbon copy sequel strategy doesn't work as a result. However, for the low price of 14.99, the DVD is worth purchasing for the guilty pleasure provided by the original - and the sequel can be enjoyed if only as a way to pass the time until the third film (a decent third entry in the tired series directed by newcomer James Tomack) is released.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	While the first of the Revenge of the Nerds films helped to breathe new life in the struggling teen film market and moved the genre back to college all the while helping to create a newer "hipper" version of the "nerd" character in teen cinema - the same cannot be said for its sequel. Still, it's refreshing to see Jeff Kanew's first successful feature film, as long as it doesn't make you wonder how a director with a gift for great comedic direction managed to lose his way with such dismissable tripe as 1989's Troop Beverly Hills and the flabby Kathleen Turner pic V.I. Warshawski. Nevertheless, Revenge of the Nerds still works as a triumph in teen cinema with a talented cast (led by Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, and a delightfully evil Ted McGinley - before Happy Days, The Love Boat, and Married With Children turned him into a one-dimensional acting joke). Even the normally noxious Timothy Busfield has fun with his role as the violin playing Poindexter. With a story that celebrates (however problematically) diversity in class, race, and sexuality - the film succeeds on a level beyond merely making the audience laugh. Add to this a touchingly heartfelt final speech by Anthony Edwards, and there is only one way that the sequel could have gone - down.Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise has neither the sensitivity nor the humor of the first film. Directed with heavy handed excess by Hollywood uber producer Joe Roth (you have probably stumbled into a few of his sequels - most notably Young Guns II and The Exorcist III - not to mention his directing work which includes 1990's passable Coupe DeVille and last years America's Sweethearts), Roth manages to strip mine the first film of its humor and originality and replaces its gentle approach to T&A; with a hamfisted collection of fart jokes. It does have some grin worthy moments (such as the memorable zen loogie), but its otherwise a xerox of the first film, faded and uninspired. It may please die hard fans of the series, but I was disappointed at the young age of 14 - and 14 year olds aren't hard to impress.Still, the DVD is worth picking up if only for the beautiful transfer of the first film, which is both impressive in its visual design - taking the production beyond the sitcom modeled standard for eighties comedies. I believe that the second film is packaged with the first because Fox knew that people were unlikely to buy it on its own. I know I would be.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	I never saw this film in theaters. The reason I didn't was because the critics seemed to hate it so much I didn't want to waste my money. The other day, I rented it when I was standing at the video store and it was one of the only things left. I am so glad that I rented this film. I'll most likely go and buy it sometime next week. And here's why:With a resin-caked genius, the guys in the comedy troupe Broken Lizard have made what is one of the most enjoyable and consistently funny films of recent years. It doesn't suffer from the third act unfunnyness that other comedies suffer when they sacrifice laughs and an established pace in favor of trying to wrap up a plot that wasn't that great in the first place. (A good example of this? How about the sometimes painfully bad ending to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - or any other movie where the plot and/or subplot love interest get in the way of comedy.) Here, although there is a love interest and there is a cohesive plot, one needent worry because these elements don't detract from the film at any point. Instead, the film keeps its spirit and pace going - never stopping to take ANYTHING seriously. There are very few gags here that don't work and if you're a fan of the aforementioned Jay & Silent Bob or Dude Where's My Car - this stoner comedy will most likely work for you. The film opens with a scene lifted out of Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke - with a nice twist or two - and manages to maintain the energy throughout the film. Also, Brian Cox is brilliant as the head of the delinquent State Trooper post. So for fans of pot humor or films like Caddyshack or the original M*A*S*H* - this is surely a film you will enjoy. If you aren't a friend of the pot movies though - this film might make you wish you would have bought Serendipity instead.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	0	First of all, as one of the biggest John Carpenter fans (I even kind of liked Ghosts of Mars) that I know, I was both eagerly anticipating and dreading this game. I knew that there was no way for it to live up to the 1982 film, but I was hoping that it would. I am both pleased and somewhat disappointed. As a Carpenter fan I enjoyed the way that the game managed to build upon the film. You do find out who was infected at the end of the movie (was is MacReady or was it Childs) and you get to look at the spaceship that Blair (A.k.a Wilford Brimley) was building - and all of this happens in the playable prologue in a visit to the site of the original film. The nice mood that the game builds up in this prologue (and trust me, its really creepy) eventually winds down into a rather average first person shooter. Now, as a fan of both half-life AND all of the resident evil games (yes, even survivor!) I like first person shooters as much as I like survival horror games - but this ends up being almost too much of the former. While much has been said here about all of the great aspects of this game, little has been said about what just doesn't quite work. Yes, the whole trust aspect of the game is interesting - but there are problems. Certain squad members only follow you so far during levels before they change into a version of the thing and attack you (i.e. they will change just before you fight a boss - they won't go any further - so whether you kill them when they are a thing or save yourself some health and just put a bullet in their head before it happens is up to you. I prefer the latter since it saves ammo and it usually takes off the top of their head in a nifty video game gore way.) Now, I have no problem with this - it was in the movie and so it should be here. However, I see no point in being able to test the blood of your squad if they change into the Thing whether or not the blood test comes back positive or negative. Why even put the blood test in the game? So far, I have had about 5 team members - all of whom who have changed into the monster despite my giving them blood tests in which they tested negative for being infected. So that's a problem.Second, the real time weapon switching (as opposed to Resident Evil, in which you have to switch to an inventory menu) can be really frustrating. Espescially when you are looking for a weapon, scrolling through a list, and getting jumped by five of those hopping chicken things from half-life. I've been killed many times because I pulled up a sniper rifle instead of my shotgun. Also, the weapon icons are so small that its hard to tell the difference between weapons - and since I only have a 29" TV - it can be tough.The controls are much nicer than the "turn and move design of resident evil - however, since (at least on playstation two) the same joystick you move with is also the crouch button, I often find myself trying to run from a particularly tough foe, only to find myself duck walking away in a crouch since I pushed down on the joystick nub while running.All in all this game is great for the gamer who likes survival horror or for the fan of the Carpenter film who has never played R.E. or Devil May Cry or Silent Hill. However, it will never replace R.E. Code Veronica in my collection.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	I love this game. Its a nice mixture between the stealth of the Eidos game Thief and other F.P.S. with the key to success being stealth and problem solving ability. What I like most about this game so far is that (at least in the early levels) you have the option between carrying out your mission stealthily or by going postal and eliminating everyone who stands in your path (infinitely more satisfying). The game features one of the largest arsenals I have yet to see in a game and the weapons are incredibly realistic. The graphics overall are astounding and for a video game, the storyline isn't so bad. With three difficulty settings this game promises great replayability. Additionally, I can't stress how much fun it is to go back to a level you have already played and take out every living thing with a nice shotgun blast to the abdomen. Its about as satisfying as the best rampage in GTA ever gets and won't disappoint gamers, fans of the genre, or just your average sociopath. With a wide array of guns, gadgets, and missions that can be played any number of ways - this game is gaming money well spent.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	At a slim 86 minutes this negligible entry into the &quot;stay out of the dark&quot; subgenre of horror is so bad, its almost unwatchable. Any talent among the cast is squandered as they try and wrestle with a poor script and a monster that looks at times like a tattered garbage bag flapping in the wind. Where Pitch Black used the same premise to good effect by blending it with an at times cliche alien SF story, Darkness Falls squanders it with far too many jumpy moments that only serve to remind the audience that the film isn't quite as scary as it should be. Add to this a small boy that we should be rooting for but ultimately root against due to his line delivery - pronouncing r's as w's so that words like &quot;dark&quot; sound like &quot;dawk&quot; - and you have a film that comes short in nearly every category. Of course, if you have never seen the Fog or your horror memory laspses before 1996, then you might find something to like. For those horror fans with a fond recollection for horror cinema of a bygone era, this film is nothing more than an 86 minute cliche.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	I rented this game because I was never much of a fan of the Rainbow Six series but people told me this game was good. They weren't wrong, this game is fantastic. Along the same lines as other sneak titles like Hitman and Thief, this game requires the player rely on stealth more than firepower. However, that isn't to say that it doesn't have its splendid moments of gratifying carnage. Let me put it into bulletpoints.1) This game has some of the best AI I have ever seen in a game. The enemy actively searches you out and is excellent at taking cover and even at pinning you down. It even has the enemy work as a team at times - which can be frustrating yes, but always fun.2) Graphics are top notch. I really can't emphasize this enough. I'm still astounded by the amount of care that went into designing this game.3) There are so many ways to dispatch with your enemy - take your pick. Grenades, bullets, sniper rifle, various stun weapons, even a bottle to the head. There is definite replayability here.4) Cool, cool gadgets. Including a nice pair of night vision goggles with an infared setting.5) Decent cutscenes - they could have been better6) The fact that you can take the enemy hostage and use him as a human shield was a definite plus.7) Challenging, but not impossible. I usually end up getting frustrated and cheat with most games. Not the case here. The learning curve is perfect - always a challenge, but I never threw down my controller in disgust (okay, maybe once).8) Convenient save points prevent you from getting too far and then dying - so you never need to restart from the beginning of a level. Best of all, its automatic.While the game has its frustrations - sometimes mission objectives can be a bit muddy and there are levels where you can't kill anyone (including a super cool level in which you break into the CIA) forcing you to rely on arguably less entertaining non-lethal methods of dispatching with your foe - overall this is a solid game worth every gaming penny that you might spend. Although I finished the game in a little over a week of solid play, I will most likely buy it in the near future. I'm sure it will only get better the second time through.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	I never thought that I would be disappointed by a Lilys album. I even found much to recommend the Darla Bliss Out release featuring the band of a few years back - despite many fans being less than receptive. So, the way I figure it - even if lead singer Kurt Heasley was bad mouthing this album at shows as being a necessary release of an album to make a label happy - I would most certainly get something out of it. Or, I would grow to like it, warm up to it over time. Sadly, this is not the case. Fans have waited four years for a new Lilys album and unfortunately, they will most certainly have to wait a few more years for a good one.Of course, the proof is always in the music - and the kernel of a new album is here - with the final track 365 giving a glimpse of what might have been. However, the record lurches to a rather weak start with the title track which sounds almost embarassingly like a Morrissey song from a decade back.The second song, Melusina is much better - but it manages to just sit there like a lump of cold rice pudding - not doing very much. The third track, Will my Lord be Gardening, is much closer to having the potential of being a hit (or near hit) and I'm pretty sure that this is the track that will survive this album and be played live in years to come.There is little of the magic that made Better Can't Make Your Life Better such a spectacular achievement - no nannys or elevators or returns - or even anything as interesting as the 3-Ways better songs. It had to happen eventually, that the band would release an album that didn't live up to the incredibly high standards they had created for themselves. With perhaps a good (read acceptable) song here and there - there is a possibility that this album would make a good used purchase - but only the rabidly curious should buy it new. Wait until the (next) new album comes out. Keep your fingers crossed.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	1	So, this is the new big thing. The White Stripes of 2004-05 seems to be Arcade Fire. I will say this, the album art is rather inspired and even beautiful. Someone certainly took their time with the packaging and it shows. Drawn to resemble a funeral program, it even features a nicely composed, gloomy pic of the band in their morbid best. If only this care went into the music. Although I won't argue that they are bad musicians - they can play their instruments and (from what I've heard) they put on a decent live show - I will say that this is one of the more derivative and uninspired albums that I've heard from a band that everyone seems to think is the next coming of sliced bread. From the first track, the comparisons begin - you have vocals that waver between David Byrne and Conor (Bright Eyes) Oberst and instrumentals that are as fresh as a few years ago (and why not throw in a retro (a la Squirrel Nut Zippers. Remember they were the hot new thing a few years ago, right after Chumbawumba. . .sigh) 40s girl on accordion. In the end, you have a band that seems ready for the big time. So for the serious music lover, you can move on. However, if you limit your musical experience to the fringes of NPR "Indie" radio and prefer bands that play to sold out crowds of the newly converted - you might like it. Still, you might want to wait for the "Next Big Thing" and give Arcade Fire a miss.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	If you're the kind of Beck fan that hated Sea Change but loved Odelay and hated Sea Change, then you have reason to be thrilled about Guero. It's not Sea Change. That said, it isn't Odelay either - but it comes close. This album could best be described as an Odelay photocopy done on a Xerox machine low on toner; you know what you're looking at, but only because you know the source. Perhaps it's the input of the Brothers Dust or Beck's own self-conscious need to appease his fans, but either way, this album takes a step in the wrong direction.While much maligned as dull and lacking the ADD infused luster of his earlier efforts, Sea Change signaled a like-it-or-not growth for the singer. Here, Beck decides to "take it back to '96" and creates what can best be described as a collection of Odelay B-Sides. However, it lacks the pleasing caramel center of that album and never manages to do much to stick out. The first track, E-Pro, promises good things, and if the entire album were to follow its trajectory - I probably wouldn't be writing this. However, beyond that track its mostly immemorable and you'll find yourself moving ahead to the next track until you end up back at E-Pro again. There is something to be said for songs like "Qu&eacute; Onda Guero" (translated "where you going white boy") and you'll probably be asking the same question somewhere around the sixth song. Hopefully we won't have to wait another two years to find out the answer. For now, Beck needs to realize that merely revisiting his past isn't enough for an artist who has shown so much potential and talent. And while shout-outs to Silverlake spots like the Cap and Cork may register with those of us in LA, they'll certainly be lost (like the majority of this record) on the majority of his fans.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	but that won't prevent me for giving this compilation 5 stars. It does bug me when bands seem to "reward" the loyal fans who have been paying import fees and scouring the internet for rare singles by releasing them (finally) in the US. Couldn't they have just released them in the US in the first place and saved me the headache and cash"? No matter. Stereolab could do anything and, being the kind of fan that I am, I'd run out and buy a few copies. Still, this compilation is the kind of thing that even the most casual of Stereolab listener (or people who don't even own a stereolab cd) should own. Now, I'll be buying it for the DVD with videos and tv appearances, since I know I'll be delighted with the video work of such an influential and unique band. I've seen a few on fuzzy tapes, and they are some of the more colorful and inventive videos made in the 90s (think more along the lines of sixties experimental films rather than true "videos") and the band always sounds spectacular in their tv appearances. But the singles are really what makes this cd such a treat. This compilation is every cd or single that the band has ever released - some only sold at the live shows - and is pretty comprehensive (it does seem to be missing the material from the 7" free witch and no bra queen) but it does chart the evolution of the band over the last 10 years or so. It includes a spectacular 10 minute version of Nihilist Assault Group - found on the Wow and Flutter single and, most recent, the songs canned candies and moodles from the Captain Easychord single. Still, there's plenty more that could have bumped this up to 4 or 5 discs - there are plenty of live performances, singles, peel sessions, and video floating around. It definitely leaves room for an even more spectacular follow-up to this collection. Enjoy!
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	1	Let me preface this by saying that I didn't like "Sideways". I hated "Sideways". I wanted my money back. I wanted Sandra Oh to suffer for making me suffer throught that film. However, a lot of people liked "Sideways". A lot of people also like "Prarie Home Companion" and think that "Dilbert" is among the great mines of caustic wit. These are the people who will enjoy "Thank You for Smoking". For everyone else, I've written several good reasons for you to avoid this movie.1) The film doesn't work as satire because it's too unfocused and tries to make everyone happy. Why not a scating rebuke of the tobacco industry and leave it at that? Why make everyone and everything (and I do mean everything) a target? Don't believe me? Allow me to whip out my "Easy Target" checklist - TYFS has evil corporations, silly feel-good anti-freedom liberals, politicians, Hollywood kiss-up Assistants, out of touch Left-coast new age "industry types", smarmy lobbyists, whiny intellectuals, and finally THE MEDIA!!! Those unethical journalists who only pretent to love you until they get the story. Like that guy who *said* that he worked for the Penny Saver and told me that he loved me until. . .nevermind.2) The tobacco industry, its influence, and how it's evil? Really? Why not a satirical piece about how we stole land from the indians? Or maybe a satire about the Kennedy Administration? Or the Iran-Contra affair? Probably because they aren't timely and people wouldn't care - and good satire (espescially when it isn't cleverly couched in a more metaphorical context) needs to be timely, even in the case of a film that deals with events past - the subject matter itself needs to be timely (i.e. Three Kings, Barbarians at the Gates). Which is why The Daily Show works so well now, but old episodes (say from 7 or 8 years ago) are as funny as trip and fall down a long, unfunny staircase. This movie just felt stale and its satirical choppers, therefore, had no bite. What remained was:3) Postmodernism - postmodernism, or the grating self-awareness of watching and, in the case of Mr. Eckhart, being in a movie coupled with overdose levels of irony and the big pat on the back to the audience that "you guys all get it. If you laugh at the movie, you get it. You know that corporations are bad and evil and, unlike every character in this film, you are a young, hip, aware, educated moviegoer who is savvy enough to figure it out". Postmodernism makes you feel good for wasting your life in front of a television or knowing anything at all about our culture. Specifically, this film (if you think about it) was fairly devoid of plot - I mean, when you think about it, its all right there in the trailer. In other words, completely by the numbers (but by the numbers of other films that share the same basic structure - i.e. company man who realizes that there are things more important than his evil,evil career helping save "The Man") to the point that it lazily doesn't even bother playing out the protagonist's redemption. Rather, you get the following: freeze frame on A.E. at that critical moment followed by dialogue: "I bet you think I took the job and the money, I didn't. Some things are more important". Cut to shot of his son (A.K.A. creepy child from that Nicole Kidman movie where he claims to be her dead husband) riding in car. In fact, there's no enlightenment in this age of Truth commercials and anti-corporate flag waving. We get it, corporations are bad. They want our money and don't care about us. But a movie about a tobacco lobbyist who's all smarm and teeth. Sweet baby jeebus, it's one Leslie Neilsen away from a spoof.The reason the film worked is because you've seen it before in its other incarnations. Which isn't a crime - a lot of movies do that. But I have a tendency to not call out the ones that do it well. This had a few well placed jokes, but it didn't have any teeth. I didn't leave feeling enlightened, and didn't feel that A.E. was some kind of power lobbyist. For example, that he won over a Senate hearing with the line "High cholesterol kills more people than smoking, shouldn't we have that label on cheese" would, if presented as argument in a real senate committee, draw raised eyebrows and the simple counter "cheese isn't directly related to the deaths of its customer base and, if you check the facts, smoking is a large factor in cases of high cholesterol". But in the film, which has been written, we take for granted that A.E. is a wunderkind Svengali snake-oil salesman who can convince ANYONE of ANYTHING, despite the fact that he only debates people whose couldn't form a counter-argument to genocide. It's like trying to sell me on someone being the greatest boxer in the world, but they only fight old women and four year-olds. Don't just tell me the guy's the world's greatest arguer - show me. Have him convince me of something other than the laziness of the screenwriter.4) If Katie Holmes was set on fire she couldn't convincinly play a person on fire.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	0	0	1) Did you go to art school and now are embittered by your career as a book store employee who's only artistic outlet is positioning stickers with a price gun?2) Do you enjoy sitting with friends at the coffee house surveying strangers and breaking them down into hyphenated stereotypes that lack insight or creativity?3) Did you *LOVE* Ghost World and insist that those people who found it dull and grating just didn't get it?4) Do you gleefully describe yourself as alienated from society and spend an inordinate amount of time cutting yourself and wondering why people haven't left comments on that poetry you posted on Livejournal?5) Does a film lacking in everything other than a schizophrenic desire to sloppily hit all of the bases ultimately resulting in a watered-down genre-collision appeal to you?6) Does nothing make you happier then when you watch a film and can pat yourself on the back for "getting a joke", perhaps having the opportunity to whisper to your companion, "that's so true."If you answered yes to these questions, then Art School Confidential will certainly meet all of your expectations and confirm that you were right all along and aren't alone in this world.For everyone else, while you'll get the requisite number of chuckles (using a sliding scale, probably 4 or 5 more than you would get from a Dana Carvey film) and leave the theater with the stink of wasted opportunities following you home.Art School Confidential isn't a *bad* movie. In fact, compared to most Hollywood comedies, it's relatively sharp and insightful. However, it's also unfocused, cluttered, cheap, and just feels rushed. If anything, the script could have used one or two more passes. The characters are bland and one-dimensional. Max Minghella, while an attractive young man with idealism written all over his expressive face, can't quite pull it off as a leading man. John Malkovich, spectacularly underplaying a jaded, defeated, teacher and wannabe "Celebrity Artist" never has any moments in which he is allowed to do anything with the character. The same can be said of Jim Broadbent and Steve Buscemi, both capable actors stuck in roles that lock them into uninteresting and stereotypical characters of no depth.It seemed, on some level, that the filmmakers knew their audience (i.e. those of us who have attended art school, or taken our share of art/film/theater classes) and decided that they had the option of scaling back the effort, since our memories would fill in the blanks. The result is a film where the scenes play out like short vignettes, meant to evoke laughter rather than building character or advancing the paper-thin plot. While not a problem in more accomplished comedies, here the "bits" are often unfunny, more observational than comical, and they end up signaling the audience to the missed potential for a really spectacular comedic moment.As an example, early on a student returns to the school, now a celebrity artist, and is interviewed by a pompous, long-winded, James Lipton-esque teacher in front of an auditorium of students. The alum then insults the teacher, and the attending students in an unremarkable, certainly unmemorable way, and the scene ends. It was in this moment that I realized what was happening. I wanted to laugh with this film. I wanted it to be funny. I wanted to recognize my younger self and those I attended art school with, and laugh at my own expense and naivet&eacute;. More than anything, I wanted to like the movie. But it didn't happen. The stereotypes were far from amusing, and lacked insight. I.e. The student who kisses up to professors, or the film school student who has all of the accoutrement of and acts like someone who's already working in the industry. These stereotypes aren't localized to the world of the art school. You run into the same thing in medical school, law school, and really any school. I mean, I'm sure that there's a guy at some forestry school in the Northwest who always follows the professor after class telling him about the time he went on an expedition to tag bears in the Alaskan wilderness. Broad stereotypes and bland characters don't mix for good comedy.In the end, the film falls flat with a murder-mystery element that seems tacked on and a mixed message that seems to say "Stay true to yourself and idealistic and your dreams can come true. Oh, but they won't so you're just wasting your time, ha ha." But considering the rest of the clutter here, it probably won't matter.If you're under the age of 23 and you really haven't experienced much beyond the sheltered world of college and parentally subsidized "emergency" credit cards, then this film will likely reaffirm everything you think you know about the "art school experience." For everyone else, you'll probably find this film to be as useful as a bachelor's degree in sculpture.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	First, I'm a fan of the Hitman series. I played the first game on my PC back in 1999 and then moved on to the console versions with Hitman 2 and beyond. Being such a fan, I'll admit to a bland dissatisfaction with the series, even as the games grew more complex and looked better and better with each sequel. To me, one of the biggest problems with the game has always been its inability to create a game world that wasn't cold and distancing. To me, the Hitman universe was about as real as the world of Half Life or Halo. In other words, Hitman always felt otherworldly and slightly unreal. Immersing myself in the Hitman series was almost always impossible, since there was never much of a coherent storyline to begin with (especially in the previous installment Hitman: Contracts, that had the gamer replaying some of the missions from the first game with an unabashedly tacked on "flashback" framing mechanism). Add to this the sometimes stupid, often amnesiatic AI, slightly counter-intuitive control scheme, and limited replayability (limited as far as there being only one or two ways to dispatch your victim in true Silent Assassin fashion) and you have a series that was disappointing in it's potential to be so much more.But not anymore.As a true fan, I am overjoyed to announce that Hitman: Blood Money finally - FINALLY - gets it right. This time, our steel-eyed, morally grey, Liddy-esque clone finally gets a game worth spilling some blood over. The best parts of the original games are still here, but things have changed. Really changed. For example:*The weapons - More than he's ever had before, including multiple SMGs and assault rifles, a myriad of pistols, his signature Silver Ballers (with optional laser sight and scope - as you can use your ill-gotten gains to customize your weapons and purchase different types of ammo, such as bullets that can blast through doors), and anything else that you can pick up as you're wandering around the vast environments. Nail gun, anyone?*The kills - While the Hitman games of the past have always rewarded you for stealth with that Silent Assassin rating, there was always a "right way" and a "wrong way" to complete a mission. The "right way" usually involved stealing a uniform, changing into another uniform, and then another uniform, until finally you were rewarded with a chance to remote detonate a bomb or snipe your target from a few hundred yards away. The "wrong way" meant going into an environment and killing everything in sight, horses included. The problem was, that there was never much in the way of benefits to playing either style. True, in Contracts you were rewarded with special weapons if you finished the game with a "Silent Assassin" rating, but there wasn't much else in the way of incentive. In Blood Money, the game designers want to remind you what the game is all about. If you enjoyed blasting your way through previous installments, good luck doing that here. For one, the AI works cooperatively and, while they will walk into your line of fire, they will work together with such force that you won't get far. Add to this the lack of the ubiquitous, video game "health pack", and you'll soon discover that stealth is key. This principle is further reinforced by a notoriety system that is determined by how stealthily you complete your missions. At the end of each level, a newspaper headline announces your success and failure. Complete your mission by making a hit look like an accident, and the headline will reflect as much. Get it done by killing everything in sight, leaving witnesses, and getting caught on camera and the front page will read something like "Psychopath kills 32 in bloody massacre" with your picture front and center. Further, the higher your notoriety the more likely you are to be recognized in later levels by the AI henchmen who still pick up the morning paper. Since you're going to find killing necessary, you'll need to dispose of bodies so that your company doesn't have to send in a cleaner. Manholes, dumpsters, freezers, and even the backs of garbage trucks make hiding bodies a snap. Unlike in previous games, when you drag a body to one of these locations you are prompted "Splinter Cell style" and are saved the trouble of having to drag a body over a manhole, hoping that gravity will take it down the hole. This will improve your chances of not being discovered, since the AI is tenacious and will do EVERYTHING to track you down. Leave a gun at the scene, and the AI will likely find it and the guards will become suspicious. Even passerby will report suspicious happenings (such as found weapons, lights turned off) to security forces - and that's just bad for business. So if you're unlucky enough to be spotted by a passerby while using your fiber wire on a guard, then you've got witness problems, which can either lead guards to your trail or, at the very least, give the police an eyewitness account with which they can produce an artist's sketch of 47. When that happens, trust me, it ain't pretty. Finally, the series gives you a reason to teach those nosey, "innocent" bystanders the meaning of the phrase "in the wrong place at the wrong time."*The Locales - Gone are the sanitized, eerily bland and forgetable locations of the past games (remember military prison? How about drug dealer's mansion? No? What about um. . .I'm thinking). Blood Money takes place (mostly) in the good old US of A and sees Agent 47 slinking about beautifully designed levels in places such as an abandoned Amusement Park, an Opera, an Insane Asylum (okay, they did an insane asylum before, but the only way out of this one is if you're dead), a Las Vegas casino, the suburbs, a pre-Katrina Mardi Gras in New Orleans, a Riverboat on the Mississippi, a hillbilly wedding in the Bayou, and even The White House. Still think that you can shoot your way through the game? Try it on the White House level and you'll quickly discover why they're called the Secret Service.*The Story - While nothing special, it does provide greater insight to the cipherous past of Agent 47. Told through a framing device involving a reporter getting "the story of a lifetime", the tale weaves back from present day to 2004, as Agent 47 completes his jobs for "Agency" while simultaneously being hunted by those who believe it's time for him to retire. So, while completing his missions, 47 ends up running afoul of other hitmen - sharp-aiming, hard-working folk out to collect the price on his head or, at the very least, make his job more difficult by taking down targets 47's hired to protect. It makes for some interesting, quirky, and even surreal moments (have you ever wanted a game in which you stalked a love-triangle of hitmen dressed like man-sized, black crows? If yes, then your game has arrived).Also new to the game is an online ranking system through Xbox live, the ability to play the game in a FPS mode (but why would you?), and new disguises (nothing says fun like strangling a mobster while dressed as a party clown), and the myriad ways in which you can dispose of your victims - no longer restricted to your choice of weapon. Additionally, the game no longer pauses and jumps to parallel cut scenes. Rather, when an important event is taking place, the screen splits into frames, a la Brian DePalma films or "24", allowing you to continue playing while the parallel event unfolds. In fact, everything about this game is so close to perfect, that it pretty much trumps everything that the "Top of the Class" sneaker "Splinter Cell" has done - without simply aping SC's moves.This game is a must, it looks beautiful, plays incredibly well, has enormous replay value, and a story worthy of a great series. If anything, this game is set to solidify the Hitman series as a contender in the next-gen future.Now all Eidos needs is to figure out a way to make the series playable on Xbox live - a difficult task to be sure. However, seeing what they've done with this outing, it's hardly out of reach.
A1AKDW4P8V72R4	1	1	Look, this movie is one of those movies that you watch and at first your like wtf is going on here? Then you show it to a friend, then another, and then, before you know it, you are screaming its praises from the mountaintop. It has everything you want in a movie. Prisoner dong - check. Live action adaptation of Pac Man directed by a Swedish director and filmed in a fish restaurant - check. Courtroom scene filmed in an empty indoor swimming pool - checkitycheck. Girls on their period. Yes indeed.Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. Buy a VCR first because this will never end up on DVD. Because the world is unfair like that.

A1AKMBM6OMH6V8	1	1	Peter Diamond mysteries continue to be most entertaining. I have read nearly all of them and can't wait for new ones to be published. Thank you.
A1AKMBM6OMH6V8	1	1	This has been one of my favorite scents for many years. Many compliments come my way whenever I wear 24 Faubourg parfum. It never gets old. I hope it will be around for many many more years.
A1AKMBM6OMH6V8	1	1	Bought as Christmas gift. Liked the reliability of Timex brand. Needed large easy to read numbers. Sure it will be perfect.
A1AKVN53NQHINM	1	1	This is a great product for those who do not have enough internal drive mounting in their computer cases, but have all those extra unused external optical drive mounts. I have a Thermaltake Xaser which had only 3 internal hard drive mounts, but had 5 optical drive mounts. (I still wonder why so few hard drive mounts, and who needs 5 optical drives?) This little box helped out a lot; I was able to install 4 drives just as advertised. The whole thing slid right into the case using Thermal-Take's tool-less mounting slides. The fan kept the drives cool without making noise that could not be masked by the rest of the case, and the rubber isolators made the drives almost silent. To top it all off, Amazon had the best price anywhere, with free shipping (as part of a larger order). I love it!
A1AKVN53NQHINM	1	1	A low cost blood pressure measuring device. I don't know about its accuracy, but it's consistent enough that you can use it to check your blood pressure on a regular basis for trends or any other changes.
A1AKVN53NQHINM	1	1	It's sort of amusing, making puppets that look like the members, auditioning for a ruthlessly critical talent scout. It was much shorter than I expected. I think I had all the other music videos already.
A1AKVN53NQHINM	1	1	This product (and its companion 65224) is a necessity when you're tuning your carburetor, and have to get into it every other day. Holley's blue gaskets are designed to glue themselves to the carburetor body after just a couple hours of use. They claim that it seals better that way. But it can still leak, particularly when their gaskets are some times not well made. These are very well made, and well worth the cost.
A1AKVN53NQHINM	1	0	I've installed this part before, and maybe I messed up, because 5 years later, the oil pan is leaking again.I do have a complaint about how Amazon is doing things. I got an opened box, and the wedge seal was missing. I had to buy one locally to complete my install.If Amazon is shipping out returned items, they should at least make sure that they are complete.
A1ALBAO1HACCQ	1	1	I was enamored with this book as a child and now I am getting a copy for my soon to be born nephew. It's the most memorable book I had as a child. The illustrations transport the viewer into another world of possibilities with all their detail. It was fun to spend hours looking into the details of the illustrations for more and more creatures and things. It's also a sweet story with a lesson geared toward simplicity and modesty in our desires.
A1ALBAO1HACCQ	1	1	It has points of articulation so it fits in a variety of places on the bike. It is nice and bright. I am happy with it.
A1ALBAO1HACCQ	1	1	Although the one I got was actually black everywhere and not black and yellow, I liked that better anyway. It's a good length to go through both of my bike tires, and it feels strong. It has a nice look, too.
A1ALBAO1HACCQ	1	1	I use it with exercises that my physical therapist gave me. As long as you know the right technique for your injury, this is really helpful. However, be sure you get the right strength, because my wrist outgrew the need for this one quickly as it healed, and I went to the green one which has more resistance. If your injury is only slight you might want to try to figure out if this one will give you enough resistance.
A1ALCN20BJSYR3	0	0	The only writer who should get any acclaims on this book is the one who wrote the jacket copy! It made me interested enough to read it (well, listen to the audio version anyway). There were so many plot holes and conflicting details. And it was creepy, rather then mysterious. Do not read... pick another Patterson book, ANY other!
A1ALCN20BJSYR3	0	0	All the sprayers pointed to the ground, except for a few. It's too lightweight. Taking it back today after one semi-use.
A1ALCN20BJSYR3	1	1	Santa brought this for my son this past Christmas, and unlike for other reviewers, the packaging was in good condition upon arrival and Santa left it in the box so he'd have one less thing to put together! (And the box made for a nice, large display in the background of smaller toys).PROS:- Multiple kids can play at once- Great for birthday parties- My kids' friends are awed with it when they come for playdates- It's very easy to clean up- Makes an equally good indoor or outdoor toy. We use it outdoors on our deck.- Even my 2-year-old can set it up (though needs a bit of assistance since one of the holes HAS to be the center one of the bunch because it has openings on both ends... she forgets this sometimes).- It's even challenging for adults, since it takes a different motion than a regular putt-putt course... you have to consider keeping the ball within the bounds of the track as you direct it. My kids actually do better with this than I do!CONS:- Doesn't do well on grass, since the pieces don't stay together on an uneven surface (the track pieces fit like a jugsaw puzzle, rather than snapping together).- As stated, it's kinda hard to play, but that does add to the fun- The big pieces are tricky to store. We have an outdoor chest and the three "greens" take up most of it, and then we put the tracks, flags, etc, in a construction bucket beside it. You wouldn't want to leave it outdoors all the time because the stickers would come off- Speaking of stickers, you DO have to affix them as part of assembly. Hate that!
A1ALE9H8ASY40A	0	0	This book definitely wasn't up to the caliber I was hoping for. I purchased it due to the urgent need for an ap book after the discovery that the one I really wanted was unavailable. One major complaint was the lack of practice tests. Yes there are practice questions for each section on the test, but I had hoped to take a full length practice test as well as have the ability to guage my final score. This may seem inconsequential, but I did notice a discrepancy in the very tiny grammar review at the end of the book. It seems to contradict itself by first saying the past participle of maldecir is both maldecido and maldicho not many pages later. Maybe this is just some aspect of spanish obvious to everyone but me....I don't know. At this point I can only pray that my five years of spanish experience is good enough to get me through this test tomorrow, since I doubt this ap book will do me much good. However, to give it credit, it comes with these handy CDs with practice listening sections. I suppose we'll see when my ap results come back in July.
A1ALE9H8ASY40A	0	0	I generally enjoyed this series. I liked the first, loved the second, and though I was not fond of the Weyland/Noah twist of Darkwitch Rising, my disapointment did not deter from the reading experience. Though Druid's Sword plot-wise was not too drastic and I believe cleverly done, character development and roles seemed rather falt, and I could not truly care about them. Genvissa-reborn faded into obscurity, and as another poster said, Noah and Weyland's decline was also disappointing. It seemed like Douglass simply was tired of dealing with old or superfulous characters (Coel as Lord of the Faries is reduced to being sulky and ineffectual after all the development in Darkwitch Rising). However, even though the novel focused on Grace and Jack, their relationship still seemed rather stilted.I'm sorry to say that towards the end I cared so little to know how it would be resolved I only read to finish it so I could read something else. It started out well but lost its steam too soon. If you read the first three I still think you should read it. In anycase I hope you like it more than I did.
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	1	I found this book to a vivid account of the Persian Wars and the events (on both sides) that led up to the conflicts. I've read a lot of other history accounts and this one has the major advantage of keeping you awake.
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	0	0	LKH has done it again. This book is the second horrible betrayal of her long-time Anita Blake fans. LKH is completely stabbing her fans in the back for a second time. If this system would allow it this would rate a 0. She can be such a great writer and used to make us care about the characters in Anita's world. Why would an author of a long-running series thumb her nose at her fans like this and trash her characters?
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	1	This was a pretty good read. Especially if you are like me and are depressed about the way LKH has proceeded with the "Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter" series (i.e., LKH has destroyed it and doesn't even have plots anymore). At least Kim tries to put together a real story with a plot and everything. &lt;sad smile>
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	1	To-date (may soon be overturned as I'm trying a new one from Tim Powers now) -- this is the best book Tim Powers has written. I have tried some of his other stuff and it has been like he is a one-hit wonder. The Anubis Gates is a very good read that he has not matched again in my view. Here's hoping that my current trial of another of his books comes close to this one.
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	1	This is one neat album. Almost all of the tracks are great.
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	0	I took a chance on Grant Geissman's "Say That!" and it has paid off with dividends. For the last couple of months it has kept coming back into my CD playlist and it still sounds fresh.
A1ALF72BQ4RIEL	1	1	I will admit that my wife dragged me to this movie (it was her turn to pick anyway &lt;wry smile>). I was afraid that I would not enjoy this at all. What a nice surprise -- it was just plain fun to watch! Give it a try if you haven't already.
A1ALLBWYWFVZD2	1	1	This is a great introductory text on the major religions of the world. It is written in clear, understandable manner with many excellent photos. While it does not go into any great depth on any one religion, it makes an easy way to grasp the fundamentals of many religions in an interesting manner.
A1ALLBWYWFVZD2	0	1	I teach introductory philosophy at the college level and was assigned this book three years ago. While it does have a multi-cultural approach it is very expensive, the introductory sections are not all that good, and it fails to have a section by itself dealing with the issue of death, which is comparable to having a text on religion without a unit on God. There are better, much cheaper books that are better suited to beginning students of philosophy. I am changing using this text after continuing complaints from students about its difficulty and cost. Students are the best consumers here. Perhaps a two semester, more advanced course in philosophy might better use this text.
A1ALLBWYWFVZD2	1	1	This is a haunting, well written novel, one of the few I have read twice then kept where I can read again. It leaves one occupying what feels like another dimension. Perhaps that was his intention.The Brief History of the Dead
A1ALO93Z117X3W	1	0	As other reviewers have commented this post-Civil War novel explores parts of post-war history many are unfamiliar with. I opened this a second time and went to the end - something only second time readers should do! The last three pages are the thing...Please don't skip ahead.
A1ALO93Z117X3W	1	0	Nothing to add to these very positive reviews, except the real ending. It's a year or so later in the village, hint, hint...
A1ALP0TQCV7SA1	0	0	If you're looking for something new on Barry Bonds, skip this book. The Sports Illustrated excerpt has just about everything in it already. Bonds takes up may 1/3 of the book. The rest is focused on Victor (yawn) Conte, Greg Anderson, and the track & field olympians.Some of the chapters repeat incidents earlier mentioned. There are no smoking guns. You already heard what Bonds' ex-girlfriend said, and there's nothing more in the book about her. The "leaked" testimony... if you followed the story, you already know it. Bonds admitted nothing, Giambi did, Sheffield blamed Bonds.There is virtually no first-hand investigative reporting in this book.
A1ALP0TQCV7SA1	1	0	Of course it's gross, of course it's not Shakespeare, it's zombies on an airline flight. If you've ever flown late-night into Philadelphia on USAirways with checked baggage, you'll already have experienced these horrors.Fun, escapist fare.
A1ALP0TQCV7SA1	0	0	If you are reading these books from interest from watching True Blood on HBO, you will probably be disappointed. A lot of superficial story, no depth on interesting characters or relationships. Several "new" characters are simply plot devices that are killed off by the end of this story.I'm getting bored with this series. Consider Christopher Moore's Vampire books, like "Bloodsucking Fiends" as an alternative.
A1ALUBGFJ3DR8S	1	0	This movie isn't the greatest movie ever, but it's a realistic depiction of how we may handle deep space science and the handling of anomalies that point in the direction of the observance of intelligent life out there.This movie captures the same spirit that the original The Day the Earth Stood Still did so long ago in ythe 50's.There's no crazy unbelievable BS (cept for the end for some people) deus ex machina, but it makes me think its the most realistic depiction of first contact.
A1AM27N97XHSYR	1	1	This album is tricky......If you are a first timer to electronica or daft punk this album is not for you. If you are a fan of daft punk you will either love this or hate it. Like with anything daft punk does they always try something different for every album they pump out. Most people claim that the album is repetitive and boring. What people forget is that this album is more of a statement than a album. When daft punk made this album they were trying to find where human emotions reside in music or something like it.This album is very hard to like but if you keep listening to it, after awhile it starts to grow on you.If you have listened to their past hits and are thinking about buying this then I would suggest that you wait for ALIVE 2007. You will probably like these songs alot more mixed up with other hits live than in 5min repetitive loops.
A1AM27N97XHSYR	1	1	Very intense live album.Hits you hard and fast, you don't have to be a fan of electronica to enjoy this. If you are a fan of daft punk you need to pick this up, to prepare for the mind-blowing sequal ALIVE 2007.Prepare Youtself for the Next Level!
A1AMKFFGRY4X6Q	0	0	Wow! How clever of Euro Pro to make a disposable vacuum! No other company has ever thought of that before! They did forget to mention on the box that the vacuum can last up to three months. This is a plus for people who don't want to purchase a new vacuum every month. This one lasts so long (THREE WHOLE MONTHS!) that you only have to buy four per year. At $60.00 apiece, that's only $240 per YEAR. What a deal!Oh, wait a minute. My mistake. It's not supposed to be disposable. But alas, it is. Besides, you could take that $240 and go to a vac shop and get a commercial quality vacuum for about $300. And it would last for many YEARS, not just three MONTHS.After my first Euro Pro cordless went kaput (after three months), I tried in vain to get support from customer service. Euro Pro's customer service is worse than bad, it is non-existent. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a negative 10!Thinking that perhaps I just had a lemon, I foolishly bought a new Shark. (I have a bad back, and it is difficult to bend over and plug and unplug a vacuum.) It lasted three months as well. I thought perhaps it was the belt, and I finally managed to order a belt from the internet, and took the Shark to a vac shop to have the belt replaced. The vac man said it was a piece of junk, but he swapped out the belt. The vacuum will now pick up SOME of the dog hair off the carpet, though not much else, but it is useless on hard surface floors.Due to the complete lack of anything even remotely resembling customer service at Euro Pro, I will NEVER buy another Euro Pro product as long as I live. I sincerely hope that my experience will not be in vain, and that it will help keep others from wasting their hard earned money on this or any other Euro Pro product.
A1AMKFFGRY4X6Q	0	1	When I read this book, I felt as though I was an utter failure as a woman, wife, mother, and teacher. I simply cannot schedule every second of my life, and I certainly do not wish to do the same for my children. While I understand the need for order, "assigning" every minute of the day is more than I am capable of doing. This might work for a very left brained person, but for this right brained poet/musician/etc. it is a concept that does not work with the way I work. As I read the book, I kept feeling that I was somehow not pleasing God because I was not scheduling my life properly. I think that the Maxwells did not plan for "Be still, and know that I am God" in their scheduling book.I am glad to hear that it works for them. I think that some of the material in the front of the book is good, as it goes into why schedules are important. But there are many kind of schedules, including block schedules, and the schedule promoted by this book is too restrictive and controlling. Sure, I can do it on paper - I did it -and if I were planning a schedule for someone else this would be a great way to do it. But trying to actually implement the stringent schedule stifled my thought processes and took the joy out of the day. I will admit it was pretty good for a one week "home summer camp" session that we did. I used the tips in the book to schedule our "camp activities" and it helped us get "back on track" during the day. But we ended up missing out on things because it wasn't "time" for them. Although our schedule was still much looser than the schedule proposed by the book, once camp was over it was a delight to get back to being able to immerse ourselves in our studies and projects, without having to restrict ourselves to only a certain time each day in which to learn and grow and dig deeper into things.The Thomas Jefferson Education method stresses "schedule time, not content", and this is a wonderful way to make sure that you are doing something worthwhile with your time, while allowing for your interests and God's leading in what specifically you study each day. It also allows time for students to become immersed in what they are studying, without having to watch a clock and turn off their brains so they can turn them on in a different area. The same is true if you are not a student. Clock watching does not generally make for the highest quality work.I do wish I had not bought the book, because it has been an albatross around my neck for years. I keep thinking I should read it again, and maybe this time I can "get it right". But now I realize that the Maxwells cannot tell me how to "get it right", because they haven't the foggiest notion of how God made me or how I work best. All they can really do is share what works for them. My entire life I have created late at night: papers for school; poems; music; sewing projects; letters. The creativity is not as strong during the day, and it is certainly not at its peak early in the morning. God did not make everyone the same, and we have to remember that.So now, I believe I will go back and read the first section again. And then I will let the book go. I finally feel free to sell my book to someone else, who functions in such a way as to benefit from the book.I also bought Managers of Their Chores, but I never read it. I am going to let it go as well.Is this book good for others? For a lot of others, yes. I think there are probably more left brained than right brained people running around, and again, they would probably derive some benefit from this book. Again, if I were scheduling for others this would be a great resource. But scheduling is not the same as implementing, and we must keep who and what we are in mind when we are making a schedule that works for us individually. So I am hoping to find a left brained person who would like to benefit from my copy. Then I can finally stop feeling guilty because I don't measure up to the Maxwells' idea of the way people should order their lives.
A1AMV4422DZXCT	1	1	"Life & Works" is an excellent telling of the life of Mozart that primarily uses his letters, the letters of his family and friends, and his excerpts of his music. It is a rich combination that avoids many of the cliches of other biographical pieces (such as not ending with the Requiem)and gives a freshness and vibrancy to his life. The narrator was charming and quite entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed "Life & Works" and recommend it to Mozart lovers and those new to his work!
A1AMV4422DZXCT	0	0	Is anyone else suspicious of the multiple great reviews this program has received? Most of these reviews seem too good to be true. What about that the only seller is 20 versions of SMARTFRENCH? I am suspicious.
A1AMV4422DZXCT	1	1	This is an excellent assortment of Hawaiian music from popular to classical styles. This CD does not represent one type of music but reflects a wide range from Hawaii's past to contemporary sounds. If you want to hear a broad range of Hawaiian music, then this CD if for you! I have a large collection of Hawaiian music and I was pleasantly surprised at this compilation! I highly recommend it for those who are new to Hawaiian music and to those who might want to open themselves up to something a little different. Also, any collection that has Brother IZ on it has to be good!
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	First impressions: what a cast! A superb collection of actors, all fitting neatly into a carefully crafted film. Sets, music, tone - all are excellent, and drag you into the era beautifully.The plot is a neat one, too. Most of the characters (except, bizzarely, Spacey's) are pretty three-dimensional, and the realisation that there is no 'good guy' in the cast helps to give the film credibility. Applause, too, for the climatic scene, which is nicely done, if a little awkwardly ended.Flaws? With the stellar cast, DeVito in particular seems forgotten after the first fifteen minutes, and in general the uncovering of the truth seems a little contrived - was that REALLY enough evidence to expose the conspiracy? Perhaps the book has the answers. Anyway, the significant point is that I want to go and find out - the film has drawn me in that much.Overall, a beautiful and seamless film, with a real sense of emotion.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	To deal with the flaws in 'The Matrix' might take a while. It isn't a high-brow or particularly profound film. What is it? An exhilarating, exhausting, immersive ride through some imaginative filming and unimaginative writing.Complaints about Mr. Reeves can, in my opinion, be more than cancelled out by applause for Mr. Fishburne, who is nothing short of magnificent for the first half of the film. Hugo Weaving is also a great surprise as the inhuman Agent Smith, and should be raking in cash for his next few roles, if there's any justice in this world.Give thanks, please, for the moody and perfectly-placed soundtrack, the clever SFX, and the enthralling fight sequences. Niggles 'The Matrix' may have, but, while you're watching, you won't have the breath to criticise. And that's all you can ask from an action/sci-fi movie. 'Blade Runner' it ain't.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	If this is the death rattle of the Trek franchise, then it deserves to be mourned, because Mr. Frakes pulled something rather special out of his hat with this one. From the moment the truly beautiful score starts up, this film is polished, exciting, engrossing, and slick.Special effects are a tad patchy, but at their best rival anything short of 'The Matrix', with CGI finally pulling Trek into blockbuster realm. Acting is solid, and is raised to extraordinary heights during one scene between Picard and Lily in the Captain's Ready Room, which is simply superlative drama. It may be the best scripted- and acted- scene in Trek.So the humour falls a little flat at times, and the normal Trek mantra of thoughtfulness and caring-sharing gets pushed to the rear. So what? This is a stylish, smooth addition to a legendary genre, and is the 90s equivalent of The Wrath of Khan. If only they could have kept it up . . .
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	As a political student of Reagan's time in office, this book is one of the two accounts of that era which hooked me. Noonan, as a former Democrat, gives a wonderfully readable and absorbing account of a period of time vital to any understanding of modern American politics.It is fair to say that she glosses over the flaws in the White House - the staff feuds, the debacle of the Iran-contra scandal. But in doing so she is merely giving an impression of the presidency from an ideological perspective, rather than a political standpoint.It may not be a political textbook, but it is an eloquent and enthralling autobiography.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	If you mixed 'Fargo' with 'Waiting for Guffman', you might get something a little like 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. The humor's none too subtle (and some of the characters really get savaged) but it's hard to dislike a film that has such a wacky sense of fun.Central performances are strong and stable, with Denise Richards in particular providing a clever main hate figure. Occasionally the humor takes a dive towards the cheap, but overall it's heartwarming and just surreal enough. Good stuff.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	Those Lethal Weapon fans out there won't be interested in my opinion, but for those who are just looking for a fun action/comedy thriller, try this on for size. You've got some 'buddy' comedy which is actually funny (making a change from a lot of tired cop films) and some really well-staged action scenes. You can see the Joel Silver (Matrix) influence.There's always going to be a touch of uneasiness if you're coming in to a franchise late, and the end scenes can get a bit silly if you don't have an emotional investment in the characters. But overall the beautifully choreographed action, low-key and offbeat humour, and general energy of the stars make this a film you should definitely try.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	It really is the perfect combo. Mann, director of thriller-of-the-decade 'Heat', along with giant Pacino and hot property Crowe. Add an excellent supporting cast (including Plummer), a true story with real drama, and atmospheric music, and you appear to have the ideal package.Except . . . except . . . it's too long. And I hate saying that, because I LIKE long movies, but there's just not enough drive in this to make it to the end without a push. Mann also seems confused about his lead - Crowe gives a superlative performance worthy of the camera's eye, yet at the end of the day it's Pacino who gets the closing shot. Crowe's character is cast aside. Is this a veiled comment on Pacino's character's attitude towards his charge?But Mann's accomplishment, in the end, is to create a masterwork which, as you watch, you forget is a film. All the characters and actors seem to be real, and you tune in so perfectly to the style and direction that any other film, watched after 'Insider', seems thin, cartoonish. Two-dimensional. That is Mann's unique gift, and you're missing out if you miss it.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	You know the kind of movie that you really think you ought to dislike? The kind that has trite happy endings, characters which are caricatures and plot twists which are convenient rather than logical? Welcome to the best of the lot.Why does it work so well? Cusack is, as always, remarkably good, forcing the audience to empathize with him in a way no other modern actor seems to have a handle on. Support, from his sister, his friend Tim Robbins, and the rest is also strong, although not ground-breaking.Those who have read Hornby's book (and it's even better than the film, as these books always are) will not feel betrayed. Those who have not will, in spite of themselves, be pleased. But those who expect an American Beauty-style complete attitude revelation will be disappointed.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	Extraordinary. The perfect opportunity for a bad film was here - an emotive story, complex battle scenes, pathos flying in every direction. Yet led by stirring music, polished direction and powerhouse acting, 'Glory' runs away with the Civil War crown.The top four billed - Broderick, Washington, Freeman and Elwes - all play marvellously, fitting into the story as if they've lived it. Washington couldn't have done more to deserve his Oscar, and frankly in most films you'd be itching for his next scene while watching. But not here, because there's so much more to marvel at.They're not out there alone. Zwick handles his budget and extras masterfully (follow the commentary for details) and his production talents make Glory into a blockbuster film. James Horner's score is fabulous, as has been pointed out by others - and if the score gets noticed like this one has, you know it must be special.The last twenty minutes of the film, in terms of emotional weight and power, stack up with anything I've seen in film. The ending really is that good.People who haven't seen this film are missing a tale of courage, honor, and victory-through-defeat that has yet to be bettered by modern film.
A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	1	1	It's not the wire-fu, or the Eastern influence, or anything like that. It's that those movie-goers who aren't familiar with the genre were completely blown away by the epic sweep and polish of the film.CTHD is perhaps a fine definition of the term 'epic'. Count 'em: two love stories, both somewhat forbidden, several huge landscapes, characters with dignity, poise, and adult motivations, and enough eye-popping fight scenes to shake a Green Destiny at. For me, at least, it's the kind of film that leaves you staggering out of the cinema, with your faith in the direction of modern film-making at least somewhat revived. In an era of cheesy TV series remakes, pointless big-bidget action sequels and formulaic big-name romantic comedies, there are at least some films which can feel fresh, young, and honest.And for those complaining about subtitles or flying powers: please don't bother. If films were only about real life, no-one would watch them. Suspension of disbelief is why we watch James Bond, Captain Kirk, and Ellen Ripley. Do this film the same courtesy, please.
A1AN3DIU4RYHAA	0	0	Orchestral music enthusiasts who enjoy cinematic scores will, predictably, enjoy Howard Shore's composition for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the other scores in this series as well. Of the three CDs, The Two Towers does I think show us the greatest range of Shore's thematic elements used in the eponymous movies. This CD is comprised of music incidental to scenes set in Rohan, Fangorn's Forest, and the approaches to Mordor, but it is the Meduseld/Theoden themes that "stay with you" well after the soundtrack ends.The CD does, however, have a major presentation flaw. When played in a computer, there is an autostart web-link that impedes listening. You have to work around the web link in order to merely play the music. The link is nothing other than a garden variety in your face advertisement, and a solicitiation to join their website and otherwise provide them with information that will presumedly be used as an excuse to annoy you with MORE advertising.
A1AN3DIU4RYHAA	0	0	This is a review of the Eureka 2596A "Atlantis Deep Steam Extractor." We borrowed it from my mother in law to clean a ordinary thin-pile carpet. The device has two tanks. One holds hot tapwater (you heat it, the machine has no heater) and the other is an uptake tank for the dirty water. The instant we installed the clean water reservoir the water began to flow profusely into a puddle on the carpet. Changing the flow/shampoo settings and avoiding contact with the "Spray" button did not staunch the tide. The suction was mediocre, recapturing about half of the water applied; saturating a rug with water and recapturing the water WILL get some of the dirt out. But there was nothing "Deep" much less "Steamy" or "Extraction like" about the process. You'd get the same results with a ShopVac Wet Vac and a bucket of hot water.So don't waste your money on this bit of overblown hype. It's little other than a medium-powered wet vac. The "heat" for the "steam" is in reality whatever temperature water you use to fill the clean water reservoir.
A1AN47A2YHQ65I	1	1	Great wetsuit for little kids. Provides enough warmth for swimming lessons, beach etc. Good arm movement, easy on and off with big zipper. Wasn't crazy about color combo...sort of a cross between Ronald MacDonald and a generic Super Hero. But kids seemed happy enough with it and it makes it easy to keep an eye on the little ones. Had one of these for my daughter, I bought it big and it lasted 4 years of swimming lessons and ocean going vacations, would have passed it on to my son, but it is pink! Still in great shape.
A1AN47A2YHQ65I	1	1	This is an excellent item, especially good for ages 8+, or anyone with an interest in Ancient Egypt. It is informative, fun, and easy to use. A guide to writing popular messages is included, such as how to spell out "Happy Birthday" or "Thank You" in the ancient script. My 10 year old received this as a gift and really loves it.
A1AN47A2YHQ65I	1	1	My 6 year old received this for Christmas and it has been a hit in our home ever since. It's a combination of matching and math, but you don't have to be brilliant at either one to enjoy the game. It recommends ages 8 and up, but my 6 year old had no problem getting the concept. Basically you try to collect one of each animal type (there are 7) with the highest number value for each animal (7 being the highest). The hyenas are minus points so you have to try to get rid of those. It's a lot of fun and the whole family has enjoyed playing this game. The element of luck tempers the actual skill of the players so everyone has a chance at winning. Gamewright is an awesome company!
A1ANKVTYZA8OWA	0	0	As a &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; fan, I'm always looking for movies with a &#34;Phantom&#34; theme. When I saw the title, &#34;Angel of Music,&#34; I was intrigued, since the Phantom is referred as the &#34;angel of music.&#34; The description mentioned that it would make you rethink Lerouxs's romantic story, so I knew I had to see it. But after I watched it, I was disappointed.Even though it did make numerous references to the story, I didn't care much for the storyline involving a mysterious cult linked to the novel. The actual &#34;Phantom&#34; scenes were OK, but it was like watching a school production. The acting and action (or lack of) was corny.This version might be better off hiding underneath the Paris opera house or destroyed by a falling chandelier...
A1ANKVTYZA8OWA	1	1	The Marx Brothers were comic geniuses. They always keep me laughing with their crazy antics, physical comedy & Groucho's sly humor. The musical scenes (singing, dancing, Chico's piano playing and/or Harpo playing the harp) are wonderful and fun to watch/listen to. A must for Marx Brothers fans.
A1ANKVTYZA8OWA	1	1	I've never seen the 1962 film version, so I can't compare the two, but I will say that this version is delightful. Matthew Broderick is wonderful as con man &#34;Professor&#34; Hill and Kristin Chenoweth is sassy and sweet as Marian the librarian. Molly Shannon adds fun to the film.
A1ANNHJXPP3AHJ	0	0	Boring!!! His singing is so boring. This song is so boring. If I could vote 0 I would. Don't buy this. His singing is the same run of the mill the Music Industry is trying to shove down our throats. He is not the American Idol!!!!
A1ANNHJXPP3AHJ	1	1	The long wait was well worth it. I just don't want to wait another 11 years for a cd. The songs are Bob Seger. I loved the edge on Simplicity. Great song! He is such a great lyricist. I love this cd. You will not be disappointed.Thank you Bob Seger!!!!
A1ANU3CSE9P8JA	1	1	Motorhead was one of the greatest heavy metal band ever,and without a doubt they're still kicking ASS!!!Lemmy Kilmister doesn't have a killer voice line like Halford or Dickinson, but he definitely got his ball!! What are you metal heads waitting for?BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!

A1AO4R7CRJTLG3	1	1	I have not used this product yet, waiting until the beginning ofthe year. But it was as stated brand new, I'm sure it will bepretty good and I would buy from these people again. And I've hadit so long, I almost forgot I had it, it came in no time. thanks
A1AO4R7CRJTLG3	1	1	As stated the item was brand new, the item they sent was not the item I ordered, but they had no problem correcting the problem, they really stick by their word, and I would buy from them again. thanks

A1AO6T0JFLL6X8	1	1	This is a really great little item for tent campers. Easy to mount with the magnetic base and works very well. I'd recommend it.
A1AO7QEZOOQJ3R	0	0	This book is a relatively simplistic reference guide to getting started on the Internet. It is definitely geared to users of the AOL set; in other words, the uninitiated. While numerous topics are addressed, none are approached with any kind of detail or particular interest, or particular order. It's merely a collection of factoids laid out in print.There are some useful things to be gleaned from the text. For example, good information about how to stay off of spam mailing lists, how to avoid being infected by viruses and how to stay away from some of the Internet's most common pitfalls are provided.The book also promotes some stereotypical behaviors that are generally associated with being taboo on the Internet. It is also written from a blatantly Windows-centric point of view. While not every book can be about Linux, MacOS? or other non-Microsoft technologies, Mr. Dvorak seems to be particularly dismissive of alternatives, citing high learning curves and lack of support, neither of which is really true anymore.For the most part, I found little to endear me to this book, though there are a few genuinely interesting nuggets of advice and examples of useful computer- and network-related technologies interspersed within the monotony. Someone browsing bookstore shelves will probably be more attracted to a &quot;Dummies&quot; book than to this one. If I were standing next to one so inclined, I don't think I would try to dissuade them, either.
A1AO7QEZOOQJ3R	1	1	When first embarking on a new journey into a programming language, the average traveler might want a map and a compass to show them where they are, where they're going and how to get there. If where you are is Java newbie and where you want to be is programming Java apps on the Linux platform, then _Java Application Development on Linux_ is a map and compass you can use to get from here to there.This book is another in a long line of great technical reference books from Prentice Hall's Bruce Perens' Open Source Series. While some of the previous books I have revied from the series tended to be more in depth, this one has the benefit of starting out slow and covering all of the bases. You can know little to nothing about Java as a programming language and come out with a solid understanding of the fundamentals after the first few chapters. Anyone who has an object-oriented programming background will zip right through the opening pages, but for those that don't, spending a little more time will bring them into the ranks of the initiated.All of the programming basics are covered, from constants to strings, from arrays to variables, and all of the fundamentals and not-so-fundamentals of object-oriented programming, like classes, methods, objects, properties and polymorphism. Then the reader is steadily moved along into more involved topics, like putting your Java classes into JAR files, how to use the Java debugger, the software development kit and so on. At the end of each chapter, there is a small section on what the reader still doesn't know. The purpose of this is to keep the reader clued in on their progress, explain what is to come and keep things moving along. All of which makes for a fast-flowing read. Generally this is hard to find in a technical book, many of which tend to be dry and boring for the most part with the index being the most read section.By the end, the now initiated reader will explore programming applications for various interfaces and APIs, including Swing, SWT and JSP, and will even find out what JavaBeans are and how to use them and what JNDI is and how it can work for you.With all that said, this is a fundamental resource book for anyone who would want to learn how to program Java applications under Linux. Much of the information can be borrowed to develop applications on other platforms as well. The introduction and first few chapters of this book are extremely informative and give the reader an excellent comprehension of Java as an object-oriented programming language and all of the fundamentals he will need to go further as an application developer. The later chapters tend toward information overload, and while the information is good, some things are skipped over to save time and space. It may have been better to separate this book into two different volumes, giving the second half twice as many pages and more room to breathe. But overall, this is still an excellent technical book and adequately achieves its main goal of making a beginner application developer out of a Java layman.
A1AO7QEZOOQJ3R	1	1	OK, so you've created your first web page with PHP and MySQL and it's all right--it does what you want--but you want something more. Something in there is lacking. You've been searching for the best way to get your object-oriented applications working properly, or you need to find a better way to assimilate your data graphically for your boss and the only computer technology he understands is the World Wide Web. Welcome to the world of power programming with the latest version of PHP.One of the latest books in the Prentice Hall's Bruce Perens' Open Source Series is this one called "PHP 5 Power Programming." Written by Andi Gutmans, the lead PHP 5 designer, Stig Saether Bakken, the creator of PEAR, and Derick Rethans, a key PHP contributor, this book is a self-proclaimed tome of wonders which contains insights into all the key features of the latest version of PHP and the keys to unlocking all its wholesome goodness.After spending a little time showing the evolution of PHP, the authors dive right in. They only devote a brief introduction to the basics of PHP. Clearly, if all you've done is convert a six-line BASH script into PHP, you might check out a less involved reference first. You're expected to be tired with the PHP basics already when you dive into this work, because it's barely a chapter gone before you start getting involved in advanced constructs like iterators, object polymorphism, overloading and exception handling. The best part is the authors never leave you floundering about a simple topic just because they're in the midst of a complicated one. They never let you forget how to unset a cookie, while explaining all of the safeguards necessary to maintain a safe operating environment for a published Web application.Some of the topics that can be found in this very involved book are: stucturing and designing Web applications, integration with MySQL for data storage and recovery, working with the GD libraries for extensive graphical manipulation, and a detailed discussion and reference on PEAR, the PHP Extension and Application Repository, which does for PHP what CPAN does for Perl. There are also sections with great insite into using PHP with XML and SOAP, regular expressions and streams. And there's even a detailed chapter towards the back about benchmarking your PHP performance and enhancing its operation. Three appendices provide information on the packages available through PEAR and PECL, the phpDocumentor application and Zend Studio.For a technical manual, this book is surprisingly well laid out. You can use the index in the back to find the topic of your interest, but just skimming through reveals that everything is put where you can find it. Reading the book cover to cover works well also. I doubt the average reader will skip over much as this reference is chock full of good information and written with a style that keeps the reader interested, even if it's a topic he might already be familiar with.For anyone who already has the fundamentals of PHP in pocket, but wants to get into the nuts and bolts of the new version and explore all of the depth and richness of some of its advanced features, this book is definitely a keeper. At 689 pages, it's long enough to contain a treasure trove of information, but short enough not to turn anyone away by its sheer volume. The best part is, all of this information is straight from the guys who know it best, so you can be sure that all of the best tips are included. And by the end of the book it's clear that PHP has evolved a great deal more robustness than it's original title and function of hypertext preprocessor had likely ever imagined.
A1AO8AZNPSA84K	1	1	This watch gets a lot of compliments. When I opened it I was a bit put off by what looks like a "plastic band." The band, however, is Copperhead snake! It didn't seem so plastic after I saw that! My only complaint is that the hands are pretty thin and it's a bit hard to accurately read the time since they don't contrast terribly well with the workings of the watch. Or it could be my eyes are getting old. All in all, a very nifty watch.
A1AO8AZNPSA84K	1	1	The Sand & Kleen MT800 was simply great! It took a horrible, messy job and made it reasonable. The sanding screens tend to tear and I used about 6 of them sanding about 800 square feet so pick up a supply at your local hardware store before you begin. Make sure you read the instructions to understand how the valves on the unit work so you get the right amount of suction. Having a clean filter in the shop vac is also very important.
A1AOCEXTKM1D7V	1	1	Metroid Prime is the best gamecube out right now. It has some of the best graphics i've ever seen it is easy to play and fun to play. Some people might think that its a copy of Halo but isn't that a good thing? Anywayz instead of just shooting all the time the game is much more about exploration. You get lots of cool stuff on the way too you get four visors:Combat,Scan,X-ray,and Thermal. Yu get to turn into a morph ball and you get different kinds of beams and missles. Trust me if there is one game you getting for gamecube get Metroid Prime.
A1AOCEXTKM1D7V	1	1	this could be the best PPV of 2002!! with a incredible main event The Elimination Chamber Match that match alone is good enought to get the PPV!! Othe matches were: Los Guerreros vs. Edge and rey mysterio vs. angle and benoit for wwe tag team championship, Big show vs. Brock Lesnar for the wwe champisonship, Victoria vs. Trish Stratus hardcore rules for women championship, Billy Kidman vs. Jamie noble for the cruiserweight championship, Jeff Hardy and the dudleyz vs three minute warning and rico
A1AOCEXTKM1D7V	0	0	At this point i have completely given up on WWE SmackDown! This was simply one of the worst PPVs from the WWE i have ever seen, I have not seen one as terrible as this since the mid 90's. This entire PPV was a joke with the main event as The Undertaker vs. the Dudley Boyz? dont forget JBL winning the the title from Eddie Guerrero. I hope this PPV gets a 0.0 buyrate maybe it will be a wakeup call to the WWE because Smackdown is sucking bad right now.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	0	0	... Mostly unenganging, poor on historical details, and basically your boring coffe table book about BMW. I got the feeling while reading this book that this must be your standard issue info book at BMW's musseum in Munich. (I got as close as the Olympiad Colisseum so I cannot testify to that personally.)On the plus side, you get a list of BMW's internal model codes. That you'll need in anyway in order to follow the book's poorly written structure.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	I got Outlook '03 from a preview copy of Small Business Server 2003 and I can say it is worth the upgrade from ANY previous version (I am using Outlook XP now.)It will be, however, the only office 2003 product I will upgrade from the time being.Just the Anti-Spam feature (one of the best I haved used) is worth its price tag. I currently use &quot;I hate Spam&quot; (it sucks!) and Norton Anti-Spam (better but not quite there yet) but Microsoft's is more atune and I would say it works at a 90% efectiveness (it is very good indeed.)Also, Microsoft finally got it that it is easy for everyday work to see your messages in readable date formats like &quot;Yesterday&quot; or &quot;Last week.&quot; I mean, let us be honest, how many of us remember what day it is or how long you have left that mail from your accountant in the inbox folder?Fonts are bigger in the message list and the preview pane has been moved to right hand side (from below) so now you have a complete view of the Folder List, Message List and preview pane. Nicely done.Supposedly most of your Message rules (e.j. move all Jokes from Ed to the deleted folder) will now work on the server (not just on your machine) but I have not yet tried this one out. One thing that is just hands down the best thing Microsoft has produced this year is the new Outlook web access in their mail server 2003 software.It will be really hard for you to distingish Outlook 2003 from this OWA. The difference between the new version and the previous one is like comparing windows 95 and Mac OSX. It also has much of the features of Oulook in the browser version as well, a highly missed feature in Exchange Server 2000's OWA. Do tear down your IT Manager's door until they get you this one. You owe it to yourself to try this one out (there is an public online trial version of OWA on microsoft's site by the way: exchangetrial.com).That's it, now press one-click and enjoy.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	I just wanted to add another review of ms's gaming console as there are a couple of reviewers who don't have a clue about it. I have had PS2 since it came out. I was reluctant at first to get Xbox as I am not too kind of MS. I did. The console simply leapfrogs PS2 by far; not coincidentally Sony is desesperately seeking to develop PS3 in order to keep up.Xbox is simply a superior console, but PS2 had an enormous software library and game developers signed on for years in advance, which made me think twice about espending on a console with no software for it.A couple of games changed that. Games like Splinter Cell 1&2; Star Wars KOTR and HALO saw the light on Xbox land exclusively or years before they got ported to PS2. Now look at gamespot's 100 top game list; it is beign dominated by Xbox titles from top to bottom. I have played the marority of these titles, and the reviews are right on their money.When Xbox came out, people concetrated on polygons/sec and hard drive advantages. But Xbox realy shine on other issues: Xbox live make games like Halo and Rally Sport Challenge 2 worth playing over and over again.Another two of my favorite features come in the form of Video and Audio. I have seen xboxes hooked to 50 inch HDTV plasma tvs and their owners have no idea of the console's most favorable topics: the ability to display 16:9 content with 480p or higher resolution.Another funny scene is an Xbox console in the middle of a home theater setup, but set up to sound directly from the TV's speakers. Now why would someone want to do that? The majority of owners do not know that Xbox is perhaps one of the best sources of EDTV content today but also of digital sound. You see, Xbox was designed to play Dolby digital sound not only from the cutout scenes (aka PS2), but also during the actual gameplay. Don't trust me? Try and play the Suffering with a 5.1 surround sound setup and you will get my drift. These features, however, have to be setup from the dashboard (start up the console with no games in the DVD Rom to access.)Since I got Xbox I would only look for games under their umbrella, I just think they are superior in every way possible. Don't get me wrong, PS2 is a fine console with a fine library of games (specially in the Sports department) but if available on both platforms, Xbox would be my choice by far.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	Over the last year I have tried to get my hands on as much movies about WWII as possible. Top on my list was Conspiracy, a very good made-for-TV movie with superb acting and historical data. Taking Sides and Band of Brothers are excellent choices in their own context. Saving Private Ryan is simply a disapointing fictional story about a historical event: I mean, they did have like a thousand stories to chose from, why chose a fictional one? Gathering Storm, a short BBC movie about W. Churchill does not even cover England at war and is not really top on my list.There are some other very importat choices like Inside the Third Reich (a bit hard to find) and finally Hitler's Diaries where you do find Mr. Hitler in real person, not an actor's performance. Although the editing is too biased and the text scroll-ups anoying (not to mention that german praise they used to shout their Furher), you get as real to Adolf as you can. The guy was really sick by the way, and he needed a haircut!The Trials at Nuremberg and Nuremberg do cover some historical background about the tirals at the end of the war and the first discoveries of the Holocaust. Their failure to portray a single Nazi in the first, and too Hollywood for my taste on the later, prevent me from really recommending either one. If you have to choose, go for the fist one though.Then there is Downfall.An openning and closing sequence show real clips of an interview with Hitler's 1942-45 secretary and the movie is based on her account of the last days of her furher. But the movie goes beyond that to its credit and truth to its producer account on the special features, it covers the last days of the regime; showing in detail the outcome of each one of the people that Mrs. Secretary shared those last days with. She suvived the war and the discovery of her bosse's handy work.One of the highlights of the movie is an Oscar-caliber portrayal of Adolf and the excellent desicion of the actor to show its portrayee as a real human being. The actor summarizes this point in the Special Features by concluding that previous impersonations by Sir Alec Guiness and Sir Anthony Hopkins failed to show the real Hitler by satanizing him. This movie shows Hitler with a more realistic perspective: A German dictator that to his last minute was convinced that he had served the human race by getting rid of the jewish people. Whether he was demmented or dilussional was beyond the fact that he was still a human beign and very much aware that he was going to be served in a platter by the Russians two blocks away.What do you at that point in time? In his case he chooses to continue his killing spree by ordering every surviving defector to be shot, (including his fiancee's brother in law,) the destruction of his own country (there was really not much left anyway) and ultimately gets married. He spent his short honey moon in his room shooting Mrs. Eva Brown Hitler and himself.I can't say there is a single bad performance except for Mr. Goring's impersonator; who really does not have any dialog (he ultimatedly surrended to the Americans and then commited suicide in his cell.) He just did not have the precence of the real general, that's all...What distinghishes this movie from all the rest is the truth to the fact aspect of every dialog and setting. According to the producers they went into great pains to get each account right including the bunker's installations. They must have gotten it right as those meeting halls were really small for the once ruler of much of Europe.The movie is available in German with English subtitles and for the first part, I could not agree more. There should not be any historical movie about their subjects in any other language than their own. This is a clear prove of that and the movie gains so much realism for that single fact. If you want to see and English speaking Adolf, buy The Bunker!There are some very good reviews about the movie already posted here, and I congratulate all the other reviewers for providing so many facts about them... specially the guy who wrote all of Gooble's concuvines names. Wow, that was really important. What is also important is to let you know that the movie does have some very disturbing scenes and should not be watched by everybody. Nevertheless that really did happen and the movie presents those scenes in exactly that manner: to what lenghts people went to in that particular time in that part of the world.This is one of the best movies about the war and gets to that point by portraying the other side of the coin; the attackers now on the run and their last days in office. If I have to leave just one movie in my collection, I would not have second thoughts about this one. Maybe the academy should have done the same thing.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	0	1	Funny, got this book mainly to appreciate the White House inside and to my surprise Amazon took most of the pages out bofore sending it! Either as a security measure or a total coincidence all of the photographs from the actual inside of the White House were removed from the book I got which kind of reminded me of the paranoia following 9/11. Also reminded me of that scene in Seven if you saw it.They did leave the pages from the old White Houses though; thank you very much A.Why did i not returned it? Makes for a perfect funny story/NSA Souvenir sitting on my coffee table...!
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	0	0	Regarding the Blue-Ray version, which came free with a PS3 just got and could say only one thing about it: PS3 stays, Movie should go. Worst movie ever; loved all actors, until today. Now if I could only find my trashcan...
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	This is the type of book where hotshots like Clancy get their info from when speaking on CNN. This one though should still be classified. This book centers around America's First Stealth Fighter Jet while covering Skunk Works' entire unbeliavable career. I am not an american by the way but, if America awes the world, Skunk Works is responsable for the better part of that. When Mr. Bush Sr. says war with Irak starts at 8:00 pm; Skunk Works is behing the weapons that made that possible.Unlike any other book I read before; after all, how many books describe how some dead bats on a hanger bay floor proved some general stealth was a reality.Amazing in context and historic details, this one can be best described as a Clancy Reality Show at its best.T.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	The Office series for me would be something like saying 'You had me at episode four.' That was the first season.If I was rating the second seaon, this review would probably have 5 stars above.The third season was awesome; but it left me hoping for a little bit more. It did, however, contained some of the best episodes I have seen in a romantic comedy series ever.I really thought Seinfeld was unbeatable as a comedy and for those of you who still do so please watch 'The Breakup' on this DVD set.In a sense reviewing the Office Season Three is fruitless in that you have to see the first two seasons first; there is no way around it.For a commedy that portrays characters so shallow and single minded, there are extremely important core values at the workplace portrayed thoughtout the season. You also have your cliffhangers and character development, and plot points so beautifully coordinated that it only takes a few short scenes to sum up episodes worth of build up. Now what surprises you the most is the fact that most episodes include scenes and passages that you really don't pay much attention to; scenes that build up to a season cliffhanger that really surprises the heck our of you.I have not seen the BBC version of The Office nor would I ever understand how is that important to the US version. I don't see where you can get a BBC channel other than a 5 star hotel so WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO COMPARE IT?The Office (US Version) is one heck of a TV series. Do watch it for fun, you'll laugh all the way to the end.
A1AOK8IY4F9OKZ	1	1	I just read somebody saying overclocking was for kids...? There must be a lot of smart kids nowadays then. Purchased on November '07 and got the G0 stepping. After quite a bit of fiddling; got it stable at 3.333Ghz using 800Mhz DDR2s and a EVGA MOBO! This processor is VERY, very good. Got it running Crysis at 1900x1200 with ALL options at high settings and 4x Antiasling! Frame rate at that level is not acceptable, it is amazingly playable. Just read a gamespot review the couln't get the QX67xx with a 600MB nVidia GTS 8800 to run at 1600x1x00 with the options at high. I gues that's where my SLIed 8800GTx2 got into play. I would suggest for the money this is a extremely smart choice. Overclocking IS HIGHLY recomended (not overspending on the QXs...) BUT DO get a smart motherboard. My EVGA 680i A1 was not quite up to the task.I am feeding it 1.5Volts and 2.1 to the memory chips. As a whole, I am within factory specs and my temps at 44x4 while idle. On demanding tasks they are just shy of 60 degrees C. I guess this is wallet savy choice and with a very good peace of mind on your investment.
A1AOK9FTHLDYN	0	0	I only paid $12.50 when they had this for a daily special but it wasn't even worth that. Maybe the tea was old, that is why it was so cheap. The flowering teas don't flower and float at the top. Nothing like the picture. The leaves soak up the water and puff out and fall apart. But that I can live with. The tea is completely tasteless. Just like drinking hot water. I have tasted many teas, bags and loose leaf and nothing as bad as these. But the little glass teapot is cute. And it IS tiny.
A1AOK9FTHLDYN	1	1	I bought all the books in hard cover in the Left Behind Series by Tim Lahaye. This is the first book in the series of 12. I found they were wonderful, something a little different that keeps you turning pages, book after book. It is one series I will always remember and will reread one day, if I ever get them back. I keep loaning them out. After reading one or two of these book, you will want to keep reading to the last book to find the outcome.
A1AOK9FTHLDYN	0	1	You have to be careful about ordering from Quintin Publications because they are not a company that takes care of business. Reprints come with pages missing, or they send the wrong books or overcharge you. I have had so many problems with them but I still order from them. Not anymore. It is safer placing your order through Amazon. They would make sure you got what you want and can return. At Quintin, all sales are final, so if you get something wrong, they just ignore you.
A1AOL0OH55ARZI	1	1	Castlevania Curse of Darkness on PS2 and XBOX. Hector fought all monster and dracula. I know Trevor Belmont from Castlevania III Dracula's Curse on NES. I know new Castlevania on PS3 and XBOX 360 later this year or future. I have Castlevania, Gradius, Pac Man and Classic Video Games different since 1985. I know NES, Genesis, Playstation, PS2, Gamecube, Nintendo 64, Xbox, and different console. I like to new castlevania on PS3 and Xbox 360 future. I likely new castlevania different monster. I like to Dracula. I know really scare the monster. I know real frankenstein from electric. I know dreadful monster.
A1AOL0OH55ARZI	0	0	I know naked two women in room. I found nudity really. I know two women without clothing. I know naked lesbian. I know a man look naked woman on the hall near the room.
A1AP775QVO6GR	1	1	This device works great. Our laundry room was always quite chilly in the winter, what with the dryer vent letting in cold air, and it's on the north side of the house to boot. With the Heat Keeper, no more. This thing delivers as promised. It feels great when you're doing laundry in the winter now. Unlike some of the other comments, I think it provides just the right amount of humidity also, especially in the driest days of winter. (That may depend on where you live, though.) Furthermore, installation was a breeze. In fact, the one end fit right into the outside vent tightly; no clamp even necessary. For the end attached to the flexible vent pipe from the dryer, I just used the metal squeeze clamp I was already using, and so didn't bother with the plastic clamps included. Well worth the low price I paid.
A1AP775QVO6GR	0	1	The previous reviewer is correct - all of the episodes mentioned have been released previously on DVD. We have every Backyardigans DVD, so I can state this definitively. I'm not so kind as the previous reviewer to give it 3 stars though. And I also take issue with the "not-so-nice dragon" characterization. "Mighty Knights" is one of my daughter's favorites, and the dragon is not scary at all.
A1AP775QVO6GR	1	1	I am glad to see this is back in print. It was not available for many years, and this is an album that belongs in the all time great new wave music pantheon. Unfortunately many people only know of Wall of Voodoo as a "One Hit Wonder", that one hit being Mexican Radio. I respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that if that's how you know Wall of Voodoo then you should stick with the Call of the West album. I actually think this album is closer in spirit to Mexican Radio than Call of the West. They share the same wry, sardonic, twisted Stan Ridgway humor, while the material on Call of the West other than Mexican Radio is a bit darker, but without the humor.This album is actually an expanded version of Wall of Voodoo's first EP. That EP consisted of the first six songs on this album. The rest has been padded out with a bunch of live tracks. And I do mean padded. Many of these tracks are not too memorable, but there are a couple of gems, most notably the medley of Spaghetti Western themes. A tip: If you want to save some money, just get that along with the first six tracks. In fact, of the original six tracks, two, Struggle and Granma's House are instrumentals. I always kind of liked Struggle as an interlude between the two best songs on the original EP and Granma's House always brought the record (yes, I still have the vinyl) to a somehow appropriate close. But the two best songs are the criminally overlooked Can't Make Love, and the brilliant cover of Ring of Fire. I seem to recall reading somewhere once that June Carter Cash really liked this version, but I won't swear to it. Play the sample of Ring of Fire and you will know instantly if this is for you.Here's another tip. If you like this, pick up Stan Ridgway's first solo album after leaving Wall of Voodoo, called The Big Heat. Not as good as this album, but a satisfying listen nonetheless, and it would be a better second album than the aforementioned Call of the West.But above all else, buy this before it's out of print again.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	This book is magnifique. Elizabeth II is Beckham.u. She s'epous.u within the tree, the cross and the daa. The book is reading Russia U. It is English 2.u.

A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	This show is rated principal type u. Ross is NOT JFK jr, which is what they constantly refer to, in his poor marie a Carolyn Christine Stie. Joey is the sharp eye.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	This movie is tru. Elizabeth is Ekaterine Stie Sorbonne deu. She is aujourdhui. "Court" tries to mutilate her. "My Swan Life." Elizabeth II is doll 2 u. She is cyclu Spenser A, gepetto. Ballet is Spenser Stie. The movie is a little /My Swan Lake. Ladies in Waiting are not "serve me." They try to kill the Queen. This is what the title means. Robert is the C. He is the first Harry Wales, in a way. The cross comes to deu. "Will you marry me Christine?" Cletus. The soccer man. The movie is really serious, because it is holy deu, and cross you2t. La Sorbonne is cycle Stie. She is Saint. This is a large part of the violence that you see. The Hat House. Cambridge comes teu. Thus the doll comes teu. As violent as it may be, it is also benevolent, because it is le mort d'Artur. Ultimately, Elizabeth just goes up to her bed and reads her books and does her ballet. She waits for Robert to come to bay. The doll is the final see aujourdhui.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	Princess Diana Althorp is still here. Spenser is blossom deu. This is how these pictures come into the room. They are not photoplate u.Spensers are garden u/ 2iu Queen Christina of Sweden is swan u. Queen Christina is Spenser u. They are "relativity." Diana is literally soi b, meaning siren 2 tre. Prince Charles Philip Arthur George married Althorp. He is not a Spenser man. Mon capitain.tre. He is very happily wedu to Diana Spenser Althorp. (Duchess Camilla Parker Bowles is epousu to une autru. She is Althorp teu.) Prince Charles left the tree when he epousu Diana Spenser, and he is still free to be. This is why Charles and Diana are so interesting. Elizabeth II is the mother 2u. She is Queen deu QE2, Ekaterina Stie qui soi b epousu2e David, the criminal next to Christ on the cross. David is Beckham ace. He is the first Harry Wales, le mort d'Arture. There is no sucua. There IS a Queen of England,every deu, just like meme que King of France and the Netherlands. It is aujourdhui.This book is fascinating. Diana is literally underwater. It's her Spenser life, which is holy deu.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	You are seeing the real life and times of the real Countess Hyacinth Bucket. smilee. She's sometimes plaited by an actor, but she really is a Spenser, and she is suddenly really in place. Onslo, Daisy and Rose are also Buckets. They are Good, meaning the Good Chap Onslo, the Good Daisy, the Good Rose. Richard is Ritu Honorable. This is the joke with the Proctor's Pickle. Richard is not a Count. A Count would slay a Proctor's Pickle. The show is darling. The joke is the garden rose and Marshall Petin. Is she in the bucket or the bouquet? So why is she a Countess? She does recitals. Just to know, the Queen responds to EVERYONE and every deu. Royal deu responds immediately and in kind. What do you deu? Do you make greeting cards? Do you deu little paintings in pen and ink? (Think of Odette de Crecie in Swann's Way.) This is why Hyacinth is a garden rose. She is honest. She draws and writes darling invites and she can sing. She is not a fake. She is not posing. It doesn't matter if anyone comes to see. She's a Countess. Emmett is in business. Hyacinth needs a piano tune. smilee. The program is much fun. In the box set you really see the garden deu. It really comes through to you. It is a cardboard box.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	Jerry Seinfeld is Count Duke Archduke Prince Will. This is the fever of banishment. "The King beheads you and you go to bad TV." It's tru. Elaine is Kate2u 1 and 2. She is a Duchess tre. She is avant u. She is NOT Catherine Middleut. Seinfeld is "council you." It is something of war u. People may have thoughts or ide maie no whu may2tre, in other words, just because you think of killing someone doesn't mean that you act upon it. They are crazy with committees and confession. Seinfeld is good TVu. I would definitely recommend it to readers. T
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	Elizabeth II is cloister u. She is solit.u. What does this mean? She's Queen de Stie. She is an impress. It becomes about sphere 1 sphere 2. Where are you? She is rather exciting because she is still doll u. she is still young teu. Her sister u is Beatrice Stie, which is the Isise see. She is a touch of frost and deu. She is ballet teu. She's plagued by Arab whores, which is the doll war. They try to take her face and put in a man's face, which is why Prince Philip goes to war. He is card u. She's rather fantastic reading, because the doll box is the jewel box, thus the crowns come in. The light dust. The gepetto sin. Elizabeth I soi b la reigne.e2u. It becomes about the alphabet and you. She is still Princess Elizabeth. She will still surprise you. Like every other Elizabeth livre, this one is a must C.smilee.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	The King and Queen of Sweden, France and Lithuania are bed wed every deu. They have une enfant.tre. They are le mort d'Artur. The Queen soi B la blanche Yseut. She is Countess Prima Ballerine Christine. David Mark Beckham Ace is Gustavus. He is the soccer face. They are the right crosse.tre. This is why the royal wedding is good. La blanche Yseut has a new dress every deu, September teu. She simply appears in A2a.u2tre, which is a deu see. It's rainbow u. This is the madness. She is simply walking through her living room in deu. She appears in a garden. She opens her porch u. There are no "watchers." All of the "pomp" that you see around the dress is "protocol" u. It's basically everything that Cletus does not want you to deu. This mania is known as the "spanish geu." Part of the sustained annoyance with the royal wedding, when it rolls around, is that it is authored teu, but TV news does not "agree with you." You do not see the actual authored face card. You do not see the actual tree. The cover of this book is a feature of the card u, which is definitely good news. However, you do not see Countess Queen saa /2Oui. It is gorgeous and sweet. The King just meets her outside her door. TV/al quadtre fight for a spanish march, which is why the wedding goes away. The chapel pla.u is insane2u. You literally see doll carriages which is not "i love you teu." The dolls are lovely...but they are their own course. smilee. The Countess Queen makes her dress, every dress. This is why you see the House of McQueen and Vera which is Danise. It's deu. Definitely buy the book and enjoy it. Yet, know that politics are in the same store.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	This book is "Roman Spring." Catherine of Aragon is not the Queen. She pretends, which makes her a hideous liar. This is why Henry is strangely bad but good. The book is hallmark u. There is always a pageant around the day, which is something that these livres kindly say. The "wives" of Henry VIII are crazy. The 8 refers to the tree, not judie, which is something you see. You see the cross burn go around the deu, sky and stars and trees and u teu. It's a good book.
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	0	Sarah the Duchess of York is really not good for you.smilee. Draw a tree. Because of QE2 you see too many Duchesses. A Duchess is just wicked. They also tend to fall into the hag C, because their violence...Bridezilla has nothing on the Duchess of York. It is becoming very exciting again, the royal T, because of Prince Wills and Duchess Kate of Cambridge. The Duchess U is The Duchess of Malfi. 1+1=u. Basically when you see several Duchesses in the King's bay, they "play" the Duchess of Malfi! Run away! Princess Diana tacie Duchess Diana Althe. Sarah's daughters became Diana's sons! This is "hail principe." Princess Eugenie is also Prince Eugie. Princess Beatrice is also Prince B. Because of the Queen's meu, this book is in English 2 and in Flemish u. The sky divides in the Duchess treu. This is why you see Princess Queen Catherine de Medicie at loyal u. I would definitely recommend this book to any royal readers. It's one of the essentials. T
A1AP7YY7136AFG	1	1	Angelina Jolie is a few different "acts," meaning quite a few "originals" are Angelina Jolie on the screen. The Angelina Jolie you see in Salt is the top one. She's also Lisa in Girl Interrupted and in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This Angelina Jolie is not in film. Lara Croft is film. So you see a different Angelina Jolie "play." This Angelina Jolie, the girl in Salt, is height weight ratio. She was discovered at Yale University en route her Sorbonne doctu.tre. Direct- to-you needed her right eye and her left ear for "movies without angles." She's prima ballerine the Russian National Ballet. This is why she looks and moves the way she does. She leaves the movie when the "General" is en route. A man literally steps into Salt's shoes. After Russia it turns into conflict Korea. It's a great movie. They are unscripted. It is actually dangerous.
A1APC5MTXORDR2	0	0	I bought this vacuum cleaner hunting for a steamer vacuum. Well what a joke? I started wondering where is the steam? Then I learned that this is no steamer. Why the hell did they name this product a steamer to make fool of people. Even though I cannot argue with its performance (Was good) but in the end I was disappointed as this was no steamer. I was hunting for a genuine steam vacuum cleaner and got fooled by its name. I returned this product the very next day.
A1APC5MTXORDR2	0	1	I checked out this bag online ans was almost about to buy it before I headed out to the nearest Walmart store and checked this out for myself. If you are planning to carry your lunch box in this, then this is the right bag. This is outright bulky and large for a camera period. For about 10 bucks I found a much better choice, Lezura Camera bag. Also if anyone thought that Sony made this bag then they are in for a big ride. This bag is probably made by some Chinese company and Sony has chosen them as their official supplier and command a undeserving high price tag. Don't fall for it and visit a Walmart store near you to get the right bag.
A1APC5MTXORDR2	1	0	I purchased this bag in 2006 and again in 2011. An amazing quality product. It has room for a 15'' laptop and much more. It has several compartments meant to keep different things like pen, USB drive, portable hard drive and many more. Unfortunately I think the makers have stopped making this product. The comparable replacement does not quite match the standards of this one. Hence I decided to get another one before they run out of stock.

A1APF6OC1805BA	0	0	ok.. i love atreyu. seriously.. i have an atreyu tattoo.. but there is NO NEED for a GH album already.. seems like they just want some quick cash. the album cover sucks.. and this really just isnt neccessary!
A1APF6OC1805BA	1	1	This game is really fun to play. It's pretty quick.. took about 5 hours to beat. I just got a Xbox360 and I actually put that down to play the 'old school' psx dino crisis games for a few weeks. Dino crisis 2 is much better than the original (though the original is fun too).. the weapon layout and game play is wayyy better in the second one. There are way more dinos to take out and more area to explore. The graphic are slightly better and the menus are laid out better. Game play is just as fun as newer games imho. If you havent played these yet.. just imagine resident evil 2 with dinos instead of zombies. Only thing that kinda sucked was I did get enough 'dino points' to buy the best weapons & supplies till the very end. When you start a new game there was no option to keep them.. maybe I just didnt save enough. Oh well.. def pick this game up!!
A1APF6OC1805BA	0	0	I've always been a big Stabbing Westward fan. Ungod is an amazing industrial/rock dark album. Wither, Blister.. has it's moments. Darkest Days is excellent. My favorites sometimes switch between Ungod and DD. This self titled piece of crap is a sorry attempt at selling out and not making it. Filled with mostly soft acoustic tracks that lack any lyrical depth leave the earlier SW fans confused. I might have listened to this album once.. And to be fair I had high hopes, but I really can't imagine anyone who likes the other SW albums to get into this.
A1APMHP8DPIS3G	0	0	Just flat out bad, bad bad. I've been waiting for the next set of movies since 1983 and boy did this fall on its' face. Growing up with the original three movies I always hoped that GL would finish up the story-but this outing failed horribly. If you want it, wait for the dvd boxed set that will eventually be released after the EP III is released. Bad....bad....bad.....
A1APMHP8DPIS3G	0	1	I always buy a guide for the games I purchase because I don't want to spend 8 hours running in circles trying to solve a puzzle...a guide is great when you are at a deadend. I pulled out my old Nintendo 64 and Super mario 64 for my son to play, this guide was packed away with it. I was amazed at the lack of details in the guide. The guide will allow you to complete the game, but there's not much there about the extras - where do I find the flying cap etc... Sometimes the instructions are a little vague, without the details you can still spend a lot of time trying things over and over and over...The guide will get you through the game, but if you want details look somewhere else.
A1APMHP8DPIS3G	0	1	I bought two these for the WII so my kids could play Mario Cart with the controllers, combined with my original Game Cube controllers 4 people could race at once and had a lot of fun (more fun than with the steering wheel/remote combo). The first Indigo one stopped working after about 6 months. We stopped playing the WII for awhile and then started playing again, I replaced the Indigo controller with a new official Game Cube controller so 4 of us could play again - 2 days later the other Indigo controller stopped working so I'm now back to 3 controllers... grrrr I'm going to buy another real Game Cube controllerI'd suck it up and by an official Game Cube controller, my originals still work fine.
A1APMHP8DPIS3G	1	1	I was looking for a nice wood checker set and there are a number of them out there, some quite expensive, most far too expensive for me. (I wanted a real wood checker set, not an electronic version, or lousy plastic set). I came across the M&D set on on Amazon and read the reviews; a common complaint was the ability to distinguish the red from the black checkers but the price seemed reasonable. So I searched around for a deal and I found my set on Ebay for a great price and decided to purchase it. The set that I received it was very easy to distinguish the red pieces from the black pieces. Quality-wise the checkers have some weight to them, and the board is of a heavy, solid design, and visually appealing to the eye. The only complaint is that the checkers don't "stack", they just sit flush on top of one another. Regardless of the minor complaint I noted about stacking the checkers, my family loves the set. If you want a nice checker board that is reasonably priced I would HIGHLY recommend this one, it's attractive set with a nice tactile feel.
A1APMHP8DPIS3G	0	0	Like the all the other bad reviews. I used it a few times and it worked fine, and then I went to use it one day and it would only display "HI". Oddly I bought this to replace the same model that I had used for years which also stopped working with the same "HI" error, but because it lasted so long I stayed with the brand, but the second one was clearly of lesser quality and didn't last very long at all. I will not buy this model again. Try someting else.
A1APOKK3M4RCDM	1	1	Ditto with everything "Shucker" stated in her review. This is the best nursing bra I've come across. I wish I'd known about it for my first child. It's extremely supportive both as a bra and during nursing. The opening is such that there's no need to hold or prop your breast in order to nurse. This is a HUGE plus for those of us who are bustier. The sizing is a bit off as I found the cups run a tad bigger. However, I just ordered a cup size smaller and it fit perfectly. This is not a sexy bra, ladies, but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in function. The only negative comment I have is that the clasp is difficult to open and close with one hand. All in all, this is the best bra for the bustier mom!
A1APOKK3M4RCDM	1	1	I've been doing Tae Bo for years and this is one of my favorites. It's a great all-around workout that definitely gives you a bang for your buck. No bands or weights involved so you don't need any special equipment. Though I'm a huge fan of the Boot Camp series (bands), I really love doing this face-paced workout. It's a lot of fun and will produce results.
A1APOKK3M4RCDM	0	0	These sheets are awful. They are very scratchy and not comfortable at all. Disappointing since I've bought Renaissance sheets in the past and been happy with them. I will not be buying these again.

A1AQ1A4MJ3XV40	0	0	Although several reviewers here have stated that this book isan imaginative and compelling read, I have to disagree. While therewere a few moments scattered about here and there where the storybecame somewhat engaging, for the most part this novel was bland andpredictable. The characters were (for the most part) one-dimensionaland difficult to distinguish from one another, the plot the essence offormulaic, and the romantic interplay between Mandine and Key was flatand dry and routine. Likewise, the world lacked any real depth ortexture, seemingly little more than a loose collection of workingnotes without any substantive development or coherent vision. Whilecertainly not the worst novel I've read (indeed, its not even in thetop ten), this one is nonetheless pretty dull fare. If you can get itcheap, suffer from insomnia, and have nothing else to read, you mightconsider picking this one up. If not, however, I would suggest youget your hands on something by George R. R. Martin, J. V. Jones, orKate Elliot.
A1AQ1A4MJ3XV40	1	1	What a tremendously delightful and much welcome surprise! Its very easy to get bored with the standard plot lines and two-dimensional characters so often found in the majority of contemporary works of fantasy. Indeed, sometimes one even begins to question whether shelling out hard-earned cash yet again for basicaly the same old drab stories simply dressed up in pretty new book jackets is really worth it. Fortunately, every once in a while it does prove to be worth it -- and sometimes, on even more rare occasions, as with this wonderful new novel by J. V. Jones, it proves to be far more than worth it. Jones paints a world of rich texture and surprising depth. Her characters are psychologically engaging and emotionally captivating. The story is gripping and suspenseful with startling -- though perfectly believable -- plot turns and twists. I've read some of her other work, and while I enjoyed her efforts, this book is by far her most impressive and skillful production. There are only a small handful of fantasy authors whose work has so captured my imagination by its originality and poise that I have been inclined to read them more than once (e.g., J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, Kate Elliott), but this wonderful story by Jones has most definately been added to the list.
A1AQ6K7D0H48MK	1	1	It took me two viewings to understand what was going on in the first half of the film -- a dark and confusing period in the lives of the two artists. On a second viewing the whole thing came together for me.I found the rendering of the historical period to be splendid --as convincing as Rossellini's &quot;Louis XIV&quot;, though not otherwise similar in spirit or approach.The actual creation and staging of the Mikado (in the second half of the film) is likely to delight anyone familiar with the works of G&amp;S -- or anyone who has ever struggled to put together an effective theatrical production. The poignant illnesses and psychic suffering of the Savoy actors -- as well as the suffering of G&amp;S -- set one up for goosebumps when they soared triumphantly into song on opening night.The language and witty word play in many scenes were like the first stages of a multi-stage rocket that ultimately hurled Gilbert's wonderfully silly and witty libretto into artistic orbit. (Forgive me. I am an intellectual chap.)

A1AQ6K7D0H48MK	1	1	Once again I enjoyed the whimsy, the silliness, Eugene Levy's and Andrea Martin's strong characters, John Candy's incredible metamorphoses, Catherine O'Hara's dead pan goofiness. It is, I think, fresher and funnier than SNL has been for years.I am still waiting for two episodes to be released:One in which John Candy portrays Divine as the guest star in the Mellonville summer theater's production of Peter Pan. I still wonder how he did it.The other is the classic parody of "The Towering Inferno", the Charlton Heston disaster film in which a lot of very important rich people are trapped in posh restaurant atop a burning office tower in San Francisco. They are there to attend the grand opening of the building, designed by architect Heston, who runs around with with blueprints trying to find an escape route. In the SCTV version, a fire breaks out in the cocktail lounge atop the new SCTV mile-high television antennae, filled with the elite of Mellonville, which is already swaying quite a bit in the wind when the fire breaks out. When the little Mellonville fire truck arrives down below, the fire chief (John Candy) stands scratching his head as dummies start plopping around him. Plop. "Ooooh! Plop. "Oooooh!" It is of course a send-up of the phony Hollywood film and phony emotion.
A1AQ6K7D0H48MK	0	1	President Bush credits Natan Sharansky with clearly describing the reasons the United States now seeks to bring democracy to the countries of the Middle East.Sharansky argues that it will be very easy for the United States to force democratic reforms on the Arab nations of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Egypt, because authoritarian regimes are inherently weak. After all, he says, Ronald Reagan brought about the downfall of the Soviet Union "without a shot being fired".In the course of a recent debate on Meet the Press, conservative Pat Buchanan brilliantly stripped away the humanitarian mask and forced Sharansky to admit that he favors Israel's ongoing military rule of the Palestinians and opposes withdrawal of Jewish settlements from Palestinian territories. In the end, Sharansky claims an exceptional status for the "Jewish state", which is presumably to be left free to discriminate on the basis of religion and ethnicity, to be exempt from human rights concerns, and to be free to employ violent tactics -- until the Palestinians stop resisting the Israeli military occupation and colonial policies.It seems the Bush-Sharansky policy boils down to using America's wealth and power to make trouble for Israel's neighbors, including countries the U.S. depends on for oil and strategic assistance.Thinking that they themselves are purely good and others are purely evil, Sharansky and Bush are unable to admit that their provocative speech and actions feed the very fire they say they want to extinguish.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	It was one of those books whose every word delighted me. I know Hunter's books garner hundreds of reviews which rave about them, and I have to add my own five-star two bits. From the very first paragraph Lamar Pye absorbs with his ferocity but it is not mindless. Somewhere in his brain he has near-human insights about his own situation in life. He just gets through his lot as best he can in his own violent way. The man kills without thought yet sometimes has a moment afterward when he almost regrets having done it. His damaged cousin Odell is murder on mindless wheels and Lamar loves him as much as he is able to love anyone. Richard, the third of the boys, is glad to go along with the prison break because the alternative is much, much worse: without Lamar to protect him he would be a broken toy at the hands of the other inmates. This aspect of being a prison inmate is brought up again and again and makes me wonder how any released prisoner can ever fit himself back into the outside world. On the outside, the three rampage madly and get into Bud Pewtie's sights. I love these names, including Ruta Beth, who comes into the picture. These characters are all too real, and Hunter's skill make the most of them in the most telling writing. No long expositions could do better.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Her prose is so lovely it makes you settle deeper to enjoy it. We all know farming is tough work but seen through the eyes of a city woman suddenly faced with running her farm all alone makes it all the more daunting. She has in-laws, oh yes, to help or harass. I would go for paid help, myself. Farther along the scene is a female forest ranger whose peaceful solitude is ruptured by a hunter, the nemesis of her goals of nurture. Of all regions where coyotes dwell, they appear on her territory and she defends them fiercely, lust for her hunter notwithstanding. Kingsolver depicts these coyotes as golden-furred and somehow noble. She informs us that the harder they are hunted the faster they procreate to replace their kind. And again farther on, a crusty old naturalist who uses pesticides lives next door to a woman whose living is organic fruit orchards. Imagine how the two get along. We learn from Kingsolver that moths have no mouths to feed, that they must mate within a day or two before they die, and that in the early 1900's America's chestnut trees have died of a blight and only a few survive. The curmudgeon is crossing them to produce a blight-resistant tree. All the stories hold their land and the celebration of nature in common.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	0	0	While I was as eager as anyone else to enjoy the unusual premise of the movie and hope for retribution for the killer, there were two glaring flaws that turned me off. Didn't the police take fingerprints in the hidey hole? There were certainly enough objects the killer handled there. The other was the heavy safe that took two men to roll ponderously over the ground to the dump. How did the killer get it up (or down for that matter into the underground hole) from the hole, onto his truck in the first place? Where were the brains behind these scenes which were so obviously illogical? Other than those serious glitches, I applaud Stanley Tucci for his performance. Tucci has played disparate roles in the past as Julia Childs' fond husband, the wardrobe master for Meryl Streep, and was superb in each. Did anyone else notice these two points I set out?
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	What can I say after the previous 193 reviews of this marvelous work? Connelly brings Harry Bosch to life as his heart slowly breaks while he tries to maintain a not-so-delicate balance between departmental politics and hunt for the killer of Howard Elias. The victim is a black attorney revered by the black populace of Los Angeles and hated by the LAPD. Bosch's boss is terrified of inciting another race riot that might rival the Rodney King debacle and, despite his direction to Bosch to find and nail a white killer, Bosch minds his own direction to get the right one regardless of race. His wife is pulling away from him and life is looking bleak but he does his job in the only way he can. Bosch is always the respected maverick in the department and Connelly holds to his own read of his man in a riveting story.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Hard to believe this is a first novel, because the author, Brig.Gen. Edwin Howard Simmons, understood that the best way to present the narrative was to do it from a personal viewpoint, that of Capt. George Bayard. He put the pain, the uncertainty, and the post-action recuperation time in Japan in the light readers can relate to. How else to show battle except with the grunts in the mud and snow? When Bayard gets to know his men, the loss of each one strikes to the heart. Also important is the depiction of how the engagements are being fought. We ask: Why was there not more air support? Why were squads reduced to such undermanned levels? Supply, weather, and planning would be the reasons, which frustrate us almost as much the grunts themselves. In the middle of the book the war with North Korea appears to be over, and then...the Chinese come into it and prolong the carnage. The writer shows us why a soldier away from the front can no longer relate to civilian life. He cannot trust anyone else at his back except his fellow soldier. Life at peacetime and the people inhabiting it are superficial. George Bayard in Japan feels he is in an alien landscape, and his decision to act then becomes the only logic he can cobble together.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	0	This is a new kind of haunting in that Professor Dale Stewart meets his childhood enemy, now grown into Elm Haven's sheriff, and another, a woman who all the kids in his school lusted after. As a middle-aged adult, she is still dauntingly sexual. Dale Stewart goes from Montana to Illinois to live in his dead friend Duane's house. His marriage has failed, as has his affair with a student, Clare Two Hearts. He thinks he loves her insanely and her breaking with him has pushed him over the edge. Having attempted suicide (he thinks) he is still half-mad. Had his mind not been already turned, the apparitions in Duane's house, the one little black dog who became five and daily growing in size and ferocity, Dale would have realized it was time to get out and return to Montana -- or anywhere else. He holds a kind of daily dialogue with his ThinkPad computer, at first in Olde English, and then in plain English.The fact that the novel begins in the first person as Duane, the 11-year-old child genius who died under a combine on the farm, preps the reader to the role he will play in the story. You wonder if Duane will show up in the flesh as well. Dale forges on trying to write a new book on the theme of his childhood in Elm Haven and here Duane lets known his opinion (on page 161) that had he lived, "I hope that I would not have become a literary critic (or its idiot sibling, a reviewer of books)." This is amusing and one takes it as an intrusion of author Simmons' opinion of book reviewers.The five Hounds of Hell are supplemented by five skinhead youths from the village who taunt Dale and escalate their threats into murderous fury. Their final assault nearly kills him and here Dale's demons show themselves in horrifying reality. Duane here remarks that Dale's efforts at writing his book may turn into "lit'ra'chur." So which book reviewer poked you in the eye, Mr. Simmons?
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	This is my first encounter with Captain Jeffrey Fuller, who got promoted to Commodore in this book. Fuller appears to be Superman of Sub warfare. Not only that, but he can outthink any adversary, even after going without sleep for 36 hours. The task he has been given here is to coordinate and lead a deliberate misunderstanding with Russia, who while remaining neutral is helping out Germany. The Axis--Germany and the Boers of South Africa of all people--is reborn in the current war with the United States. Joe Buff throws technical jargon at us without apology, and we accept all of it. The commandos who go ashore in Siberia are an 80-man band of brothers who know few of them will come back. They are, as well, supermen. Together, Commodore Fuller and the commandos must pull off a dicey bluff or plunge the world into Apocalypse. The read was worth the feverish attention I gave it, but I will need a good long respite before i pick up another Joe Bluff novel.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	That Thornton wrote and directed this film proves he has as much going on inside himself as there is inside the so-called retarded main man of Sling Blade, Karl. Karl appears not to have noticed or heard what is said or done but it always comes out later that he heard and saw all. He is obviously autistic, yet to my mind not as impaired as other apparently normal people. I am somewhat dubious that he could have found persons, on his release from the mental hospital, that were sensitive and tolerant of his oddness. The fix-it man who gives him a job, for instance. It is surprising to find such understanding and delicacy in a rural town. We do not see Karl meeting more people than we are shown in the film, and those he does meet takes calmly his admission that he killed his mother and her lover. No one looks at him in suspicion and fear, and in this sense I think Thornton has kept his cast shrunken in order to maintain simplicity. I wanted a better excuse for Frank's mother to allow her abusive boyfriend to keep coming around. Seeing how the boyfriend was scarring her son, whom Karl has befriended or who has befriended him, I wished Thornton had built a sounder reason for the boyfriend's hold. But the boy Frank is a winner. He comes across as sweet, articulate, and one day a worthy adult.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	As soon as I delved into this collection of Simmons' early work I felt the power that would evolve into a multitalented writer. You can see where he would develop some of his stories into full-length works, as in "Carrion Comfort." Many of these stories appeared to be fragments of a fuller vision, which he would later develop to satisfying completeness. I loved his contempt of televangelists. Simmons goes from Civil War ghostings in "Iverson's Pits" to a morality tale of a teacher and his fragile student. Torn by tuggings from his private life and the strong need to give the boy something to survive by, the teacher finds a compromise, and the reader hopes it will sustain the child as he grows up. In sum, Simmons goes everywhere in his dreamings. The $1 I spent on the used book was the best money I ever invested.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	I first read the Outlander series 20 years ago and I have paid them a huge compliment by beginning the series all over again. Gabaldon's depiction of 18th-century Scotland has to be honest and true, or I will never believe another historian's version.Her main characters Claire and Jamie are satisfying as lovers and partners in intrigue and battle. I know my latecoming review is not going to add much to the hundreds of others before this, but "Dragonfly" has provided two weeks of intense entertainment not experienced in reading for some time. I do not even regret my strained wrists in holding this behemoth of a book. Gabaldon has crowded her story with such vivid people that I wish I could travel through time myself so I could meet them. Knowing what I do from the 21st century, think of the insight and perspective I would gain or offer to these people. But that would be interfering, which Claire correctly tries not to do. Except for her attempt to deter the major event of Culloden Field's massacre of the Scots, that is. Jamie is a figure that looms, towers above all other heroic figures. I believe Gabaldon is producing a new work. Hooray!!!
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Here I am, rereading Gabaldon from the beginning and now just finished with Voyager. What a treat (except for the strain on my wrists). There truly are few equals of Gabaldon at characterization and scenic descriptions. The story of Claire and Jamie continues to satisfy, and she does make him a figure worthy of traveling backward through 200 years to rejoin. Jamie has all the attributes of a braw fellow -- brains, looks, honor, a warrior. Lucky Claire. In rereading, I found I had forgotten the passages in between their historic reunion, and that made the rereading almost a new experience.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Gabaldon must have a huge team of researchers--medical, brewing of alcoholic beverages, and herbal. I know there are reference works out there about herbs, but Gabaldon takes this to new lengths. I enjoyed the read, especially the foreboding of the revolutionary war against England to come. And Jamie and Roger Mackenzie at last meet, violently at first. The thing is, I think the author is beginning to write by rote. Every few paragraphs she must bring in her signature descriptions of smell. Always in threes. This is taking the writer's manual of sight, sound and smell to a tedious extent. Why don't her editors give her a nudge about these habits?
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Having read the final volume, "An Echo in the Bone," then gone back to the first, "Outlander," and all the way through to "A Breath of Snow and Ashes," I am catching my breath and learning to read some other type of writing. It's not that Gabaldon isn't very very good at what she does, but I noticed she had begun to fall into habits when depicting emotions, i.e., there is at least one shiver or shudder every two pages, or the hairs on her arms prickle, or her stomach clenches. You begin to notice the frequency of these descriptive devices and wish she would ease up on them. Then she describes smells in threes, "He smelled of wood smoke, wine, and lavender." It's the writer's rule book about setting atmosphere gone crazy. The story itself is enjoyable but would have been better without those repetitions.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	0	0	I have admired Jodi Picoult's skill in the past, but The Tenth Circle spreads all over the place, ending up in Alaska. I learned a few things about current-day teenagers, though. They are so precocious and adult in their party games I wonder if the teenagers I know are like that. I plowed through to the final page, but very likely will not venture into another book of hers for a while.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	Wilbur Smith tells all about the upheaval in South Africa that leads to rule by true Africans. The Boers are slipping in power, and the British Commonwealth is canceled. In Parliament, Sean Courtney fights the change and becomes a reluctant partner with Manfred de la Rey, the Afrikaner faction. Sean's wife Tara becomes an ally of the Africans and falls under the spell of Moses Gama, an imposing man who plans the overthrow of the Boer government. Mixing historical fact with the adventures of the Courtney family, RAGE is a monumental story of intrigue, passion, and bloody rioting that changes Africa forever.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	This is a great big, nugget of a story. FBI agent Joe Lucas, a hardened operative at age 29, goes to Cuba to team up with Hemingway's amateur spy team, The Crook Factory. With Edgar J. Hoover's edict to indulge Hemingway's "silly" ideas of actually being any use to the United States war effort in 1942, Lucas finds himself doing more than indulge Papa, as Hemingway likes to be called by his intimates. These include movie stars Gary Cooper (though he is not heard saying Papa), Ingrid Bergman, and Marlene Dietrich. At Hemingway's table, Lucas also meets a suspected German spy and his lady. These two cruise around in a destroyer-size yacht purporting to conduct deep-sea studies, which Hemingway is convinced are a cover for spying activities. The Crook Factory actually spots a German submarine surfacing near the yacht. Lucas learns that the Cuban police are largely corrupt, that they take money from the German Abwehr intelligence organization as well as the Americans.The words coming from Hemingway's mouth sound authentically his. Simmons throws in more spies who are seemingly innocent. The marvelous thing about the book is that, as Simmons claims, 95% of the incidents and undercover incidents are factual. And Hoover comes off as a paranoid man concerned mainly with defending his power against perceived threats. That he did not pass on intelligence of the Pearl Harbor attack when he learned of it one week before it occurred, is now recorded history.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	This lady is prolific and appears to maintain a high standard throughout her works. I enjoyed The Villa, the good dialogue, the facts of wine making, and the portraits of several weak, evil men. Fortunately, she balances those losers with some winners. Sophia Giambelli is a high-powered PR person for her family business; her prowess in her trade is almost unbelievable, yet I went along. Why not? Tyler MacMillan is rugged, attractive, and devoted to growing good grapes. The matriarch is La Signora, always addressed as such by her employees, her husband is Tyler's grandfather. Plots to sabotage the product and murder abound. I look forward to my next read of Nora Roberts; she is worth my time.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	How people can endure that kind of hardship is beyond me. Not only the freezing weather but a beast lurking on the ice. Glad to read about it and not experience personally.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	She is extraordinary. She never overawes the screen but melds into it. She IS the character she plays. I could see this film again and again and still be delighted.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	I had never read this writer before and was surprised and pleased to find myself engrossed in Promise right to the end. Evans' depiction of Eliana's Italian husband is an unattractive concentration of all the male-dominant traits to be found in Italian men, and right at the beginning the reader rejects him. And so we root for the mysterious American Ross Story to win out over the man. This outcome is never in doubt, but Evans takes us there in caring style.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	1	This view of coed college is a revelation to me, for I did not grow up in the United States. Tom Wolfe showed me a frightening kaleidoscope of life on campus amongst the privileged, hormone-stuffed, drunken scions putting in their obligatory four years. Wolfe does not show much of the other side, the real students who care about studying and being worthy of the degrees they will earn, but of course why would we want to read about them? I enjoyed the depiction of Charlotte Simmons as the genius from the North Carolina mountains who finds herself lost amidst a totally alien landscape of snobs with shallow values. The coed bathroom was another astonishment for me. Good Grief!And then the student-athletes who will eventually call themselves college graduates as long as they have maintained a C+ grade average do not surprise anyone else but me. But of course! Fact of life. Halfway through Charlotte's first semester she falters in her proud stance as the brain with better morals than those around her. Her gingerly friendship with dorky Adam Gellin introduces her to the intellectuals of the Wave, the campus newspaper, but Hoyt Thorpe, the coolest, handsomest frat man who wouldn't spit on intellectuals, Hoyt Thorpe woos Charlotte! For the most part though it's beer beer beer, four-letter-words four-letter-words four-letter-words (to steal Wolfe's prose style). Charlotte has her inevitable crisis and Adam has his, and justice is served all around. Tom Wolfe is something special.
A1AQDSTEBI8BB2	1	0	Mary Karr deserves her PEN award and more. She manages the trick of speaking like an earthy seven-year-old in adult terms, and details her life with a maniacal mother and "low-rent," goodhearted father in a manner to make your head spin. Yet Mary and her older sister Lecia do not grow up to be mental cases (or do they?). Mother pickles her liver with fervor and at one point loses her mind and is institutionalized briefly. Father hangs on and cares for his girls and regales the Liars' Club with amusing, tall stories. This seems to be his only amusement. We see Lecia as a mature nine-year-old and Mary as a precipitous one and somehow the two of them weather the turmoil of their home life.As almost a sideline, Mary reveals that father is mother's fifth or sixth husband, and mother goes on to acquire another after Mary's and Lecia's father. The cause of these seemingly casual marriages are revealed at the end and it is a pathetic and hopeless one. Later, as an adult, Mary's voice is subtly changed and her writing images are no less captivating.

Unfortunately my hairpin loom arrived bent. It was shipped in a bubblemail envelope with no protection and I have not figured out how to straighten it out.I did contact the seller and my money was refunded but I still have a bent hairpin loom and no confidence in ordering another as it will likely be shipped the same way, in an envelope instead of a box.

The quality of thepaperback is poor and print so small as to be unreadable bythis senior citizen. It is 295 pages in length, and I note thatother versions have more pages, obviously because the font sizeis larger.

Each Chapter is so completely different and about the right length to read before bedtime each night. It definitely has whetted my appetite to watch carefully when there are quality 99cent specials to download! Keep it up Kindle!
A1AQHBSV09O95D	1	1	I really enjoyed reading this novel and the author has a great command of the English language. At times the surprisedetails were a little too far fetched, but the novel certainly keeps the reader right on the edge of his chair during theentire reading.
A1AQHBSV09O95D	1	1	This e-Book was really thrilling to read and kept me on edge until the end.The author writes with imagination and the tale was so different from what Ihad expected.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	This book can appear daunting, but Bryson's writing style makes all the difference. As a science educator, I can see this as wonderful supplemental reading for most highschoolers and some middleschoolers. In school, students are giving various facts and are expected to put it all together to get the big picture. This book will help with that big picture. An intire course could be taught with this book for advanced students. For adults it's wonderful at reinforcing knowledge, and putting things into perspective. I see there is now an illustrated version, which I may check out, but this original version is written so that it's easy to get mental images. I have heavily highlighted and footnoted my copy for future reference, as it is so chocked full of information.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	I saw this on TV when it came out. I'm sure it was a made-for-TV movie, and it should have stopped there. I remember looking forward to seeing it, then was totally bummed out. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the original, but geeze, it shouldn't be allowed to have the same name or main character. Totally different plot, totally corny. Was this made to be a chick flick? Someone mentioned what's his names blue eye's, and the woman in peril. If I remember he has to drive through Utah to Idaho and plays chicken with the cops. No cop is going to play chicken! Why doesn't he buy a freakin' plane ticket? Instead he tries to kill himself so his wife has nobody. Arrggh!
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	Why isn't it cold in the Southern Hemisphere? Quaid draws a line on a big map and says that everything above that line will freeze solid (looks to be about the 42nd parallel, I would think a scientist would say north of the 42nd parallel). Why is this massive weather system only in the Northern Hemisphere? The Earth does have 2 poles afterall, and global wind and ocean currents. Being a science teacher, it's difficult to watch a movie like this without finding all the flaws. Then they report that the temperature is dropping 10 degrees per second (600 degrees per minute? is that C or F?). Even though buildings are freezing solid and crumbling, Quaid and his buddy are comfortable in a tent. Then in the library, there are about a dozen people trying to heat up a room the size of a movie theater by burning books. Don't they know that it would be much more efficient to heat a smaller room? Remember when they went on the Russian ship? I was thinking that they could all move into that, and use all the diesel fuel, medicine, and food on board. Dang those poor wolves had a lot of energy considering they were starving to death and half frozen. The special effects were more comical than realistic. If anything, this movie would have a negative affect on the global warming problem, since people can't take this seriously. Two stars since it was somewhat amusing and my wife kinda liked it.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	This is a film about a dysfunctional family. Even the littlest thing, like forgetting the tartar sauce causes the parents (Cage and Davis) to go at each others throats, sending their kids to cower. Cage tries to be a caring parent, but he shows no real emotion when dealing with his kids problems. Cage (weatherman Spitz) is a "dick" as pointed out by a stranger in a bank. I hate movies when seemingly respectable adults can't form a sentence without using the "F" word. Even his ailing father (Caine) throws out the F bomb occasionally, which just seems wrong coming out of the mouths of senior citizens. As others point out they kept waiting for the movie to get better, and it really didn't for me. About the only thing with suspense is whether or not he gets the job in NYC. I didn't totally hate the movie. Its quirkiness is interesting. He seems like the last person you would imagine as an archer. I would only recommend this movie to people who totally like Nicolas Cage, like I do, but it's not his best role.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	This movie was a fairly realistic representation of life aboard a British Navy ship in the Pacific Ocean west of South America. You could almost smell the stench of the crew, and their food looked less than appetizing. The cinematography, editing, costumes, story, acting were all top-rate. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. There is little if any offensive language or sex. There are realistic battle scenes with appropriate violence which may not be suitable for children. The humanistic side of the movie was wonderful, for example the captain and doctor playing their music. Russell Crowe was a brilliant captain who has to make tough decisions.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	0	As another reviewer stated, it has no special effects (other than a few fake animal closeups, and editing magic). Made the way movies used to be. The plot is unplausible and lame, the acting could be better. A movie of Irwin and his wife carelessly playing with dangerous animals. I gave it 4 stars because my wife and others liked it. I thought it was amusing and held my attention at best. As an animal advocate Irwin should realize it's a bad idea to leave a rope tied around a croc's mouth mouth with a good possiblity that it will escape and die. I am bad at over-analizing movies. Kids should enjoy it.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	Don't plan on using this camera to make 3D lenticular prints. This camera is 15 years old and printing not available. Buy it only as a curiousity.EDIT:Note that the above was written in 2007. Since then there have been lenticular printing service come and go. There may be services now, but plan to pay more than the camera is worth to get processing. Best use of the camera may be to scan your processed film and do what you want with it. This is the second camera from Nishika which they sold though multi-level marketing. The first camera (N8000) was a total joke with it's fake pentaprism, paper lcd screen, and a piece of lead int the bottom to give it heft.BTW, I've bumped my rating from one star, to two, but the N8000 still gets one star. If you are serious about 3d photography there are better choices.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	I found this movie interesting. I can't call it entertaining. It's not scary. I guess it could be classified suspenseful. But the suspense wasn't enough to carry the film. Was ready to give this film a 1, but decided that it was typical of a low budget, independent film and has a certain strange appeal. It kept reminding me of those "I Shouldn't be Alive" shows on Discovery.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	I had wanted to see a movie by Hayao Miyazaki, and this was on TV late last night. This has got to be one of the best animations I have seen. There is definate Japanese manga influence, but the characters appear to be British, American from the the 1940's. The animation has a wonderful 3-dimentional perspective. Very unique! The story is a wonderful adventure about a 13 y.o. witch on her journey to the big city with her talking cat. What I found interesting, was that the witch's only powers seems to be the ablility to fly and listen to her cat. No evil spills or other witch-like behaviour. Mortal humans are not judgemental against her, but see her as a curiousity.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	1	This set of 4 is selling for $60 more than the new set of five.This should be priced around $90. But Noooo...
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	Just buy a dang lightbulb! First you said it wasn't working, then it was. You turn the light on and off. Just turn it on and wait. The smaller ones take a couple hours to really get going. This big one probably takes 3-4 hours to get revved up. You say it's amazing but give it a low rating.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	When I first watched this, I wasn't aware that it was a comedy. The comedy is so subtle. It comes across as a drama, but is filled with quirky humor. The charaters are great and the acting is perfect. This is a movie that can be watched every year or two and be just as enjoyable.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	This is the last nipple extractor you will need to buy, and it is priced right. You can really twist the heck out your nipples, and extract even the most stubborn ones. This one is 1/2" and should be right for most nipples. I have loaned this to others who have found it to work perfectly also.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	1	I wasn't sure what I was getting, but it looked intersting. The box indicates many form of extreme motorsports, but it is 90% crotch rockets with idiots destroying perfectly good tires for a minute smoke, and trashing expensive bikes, while endangering other bystanders..It is truly amazing what these guys can do on bikes and bounce back for more. I remember driving the interstate through Chicago when this loud roar comes up from behind and passes us going at least 90mph. About a dozen bikes pass with 3-4 doing wheelies. I immediately decide that if one goes down, I'll just have to run them over. I wasn't about to risk my life and my passengers lives and the lives of others, by swerving. This movie depicts illegal, exceptionally dangerous behavior which should not be attempted by anyone.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	0	A very usefull book for engine builders. I sat and read through 90% of the book and agree with others who call this great, however...For the casual engine builder it is probably not so useful as for a person who builds and races. I was hoping for more tips and tricks for a beginner engine builder like me. There is information I can use, but Vizzard assumes the reader is a seasoned builder. As someone else mentioned, the layout is a challenge, as the captions and text kinda run together. The book is chocked full of page after page of dyno-testing as flow-bench readings. Vizzard is very meticulous, and talented.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	0	I have this on VHS and unfortunately I haven't had a VHS set up for years.And it must be played at a good volume through a good stereo.A wonderful video for Floyd and vintage racing fans alike.
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	0	0	Dremel knows this product has problems, which is why it is discontinued.Buy any other model.I returned my 400xpr and within 10 days had a brand new Dremel 4000 model delivered.GREEAAT Customer service!
A1AQKYT6T45UPP	1	1	It easily washes off when wanted. This is the only stuff I've used for 20 years. Don't know of alternatives to compare to.
A1AQNZ3YTSQFHT	0	0	In summation, a huge disappointment. But hopefully one that will be corrected by the authors. Mr. Philbin is a wonderful man. I thank him for his kindness and his efforts to address the concerns of his customers, and I am sure that he will do what he can to get the book revised.That being said ...There is absolutely nothing in this book that Barbaro fans (FOBs) who know how to surf the internet don't already know. There aren't even any original photographs. Believe me; if you are an FOB, you've seen it all before.Typos are painfully obvious. There are a lot of errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that make the book quite difficult to read.It was obviously thrown together at the last minute, but that is NO excuse! The concept behind the book was well intentioned, but in their rush to get the book to press it seems the quality suffered a great deal.I hope this book is taken off the shelves until some major revisions can be made. It has potential, but in its current form it is an absolute disgrace to Barbaro, his connections and his fans. Barbaro deserves better consideration than this. His story touched millions and the effects of his life and death will reverberate throughout the horse industry forever.I was looking forward to receiving this book, but now that I have it I could not be more disappointed. I'm sending mine back. I've been a loyal Amazon customer for years and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to return an item.If it is revised though, I will gladly purchase another copy.So just a friendly warning to all of you wonderful Amazon customers - SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are currently two other Barbaro books available here on Amazon that I think you'll appreciate much more than this one. I simply urge you to think twice before you purchase this, chances are you will be just as disappointed as the rest of us.
A1AQNZ3YTSQFHT	1	1	I bought this collection back when it was first released. I was in line at Target on the morning of November 28th, I had been waiting so long for this set! I was NOT disappointed! In fact I love this set so much, I'm planning to buy an extra set here on Amazon just so that I never have to go without!The packaging is first-class, the tin and lenticular sleeves alone are worth having! What a beautiful way to display your love for Superman! The comic book and the free poster offer are great bonuses! And you cannot possibly beat having FOURTEEN discs of nothing but pure Superman!From SUPERMAN RETURNS, to the RICHARD DONNER CUT of SUPERMAN II, to the LOOK! UP IN THE SKY documentary ... everything you could possibly want is all here in one SUPER set!Even though it was a bit of a hassle to have to send in for the replacement discs the first time, it was handled well and I really am pleased with the level of customer service the WB provided for thousands of fans who called in! It could not have been easier to get the corrected discs. You really have to appreciate the WB for not letting this mistake slide by - because not all studios would have gone to the same trouble they did to do right by the fans.Thanks WB for putting this fantastic collector's set together! I will treasure it forever!If you are a Superman fan and for some reason you missed this set the first time around, DON'T pass on it now! Also, you can't possibly get more of a bargain on all of these films! Even at $100 it is an absolute STEAL for all of these movies, rare special features, and documentaries! This was the best purchase I've made in a long time! :)
A1AQNZ3YTSQFHT	1	1	Extraordinary documentary and a beautiful, intimate look into the life of the Reeve family after the tragic accident that changed their lives forever.Matthew Reeve and company did an amazing job with this film, I only wish we could have seen the trilogy completed. More importantly, I wish we could have seen Christopher achieve his goal of getting up out of the chair and walking again. There is no doubt in my mind it is exactly what he was going to do. Sadly it just wasn't meant to be.Christopher was my childhood hero. He was my hero growing up because of the Superman he portrayed on screen. He was my hero as an adult because of the Superman he became to millions of people around the world when he refused to give up even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Thank you to Matthew, Alexandra, Will and the rest of the Reeve family for sharing these moments with us. Christopher and Dana both have inspired so many people with the example they set and the fearless lives they led. May they both rest in peace, and may their legacy continue through the CDRF and the beautiful family they leave behind.I cherish this DVD and I will watch it over and over again. The documentary speaks for itself. Anyone who is a fan of Christopher, or a Superman fan in general, will treasure this documentary. Anyone who has had to face any type of disability or overwhelming obstacles in their lives also will find great inspiration in their story. The special features, including the extra interview footage with Christopher, are great as well.I know Christopher would be proud of his son's accomplishment.Go Forward.
A1AR0PLAX3QKTM	0	1	I was curious about this movie because it was the number one selling DVD on Amazon, yet I had never heard of it. Thankfully, I didn't pay for it. There is nothing 'groundbreaking' or 'earth shattering' in this movie. It's common sense. If you think negatively, things in your life will continue in a negative direction. On the other hand, if you think positively, positive things will happen. What the producers of this film are trying to communicate is that all of this happens through the "universe manifesting itself." No. Wrong.There's no magical comet in the sky that is the overlord of all that is and was. Things that happen in your life happen because you made choices, right or wrong, to arrive at your destination. This movie tells stories of people battling breast cancer with their minds -- only to have it magically dissolve in 3 months. To think... all those scientists and foundations who have wasted their efforts in the battle against cancer! When all it takes is a chat with 'the universe.' A plane crash 'miracle man' who recovered because he 'willed it' with his mind and the universe responded to the magnetic waves he produced to heal him.It's no secret the human body and mind are capable of some absolutely incredible, amazing things. Giving the 'universe' credit for those things is a joke. Five minutes into this movie and you feel like you are watching some cultist promotional material. All of the contributors have 90 acronyms after their names. Makes you wonder who they are trying to convince. Watch this if you want a good laugh, but don't take it too seriously.In closing -- I think that the contributors of this movie 'sent a message to the universe' through 'visualizing.' That message? 'I want to be rich.' And, so, it has happened -- through selling this incredibly stupid DVD.
A1AR6GL30CTOT2	1	1	This thing is very well built just the the older Maglites. They kept everything the same except the bulb which is now LED and its so much brighter. Definitely worth the money.
A1AR6GL30CTOT2	1	1	Bought this for my mom and she loves it. I've used it a few times and the cork comes out with such ease. Removing the cork from the Screwpull is just as easy. Awesome corkscrew.
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	1	1	This program is included as an extra on Enter the Dragon (Two-Disc Special Edition).
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	0	1	Would like to see this film released by a company that doesn't feel the need to superimpose a large "RE" watermark throughout the entire film.
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	1	1	Once the most syndicated show on television My Little Margie is never shown now and is rather scarce on DVD.Thanks to releases from Synergy, VCI Entertainment and a couple others we get a chance to see this little gem of a show from a bygone era. The Synergy episodes are good quality and compare favorably to other MLM sets - realize though that these are from the mid-1950s and not remastered.I did notice on Synergy's Volume 1 set the episode order is erroneously listed on both the box and the DVD menuswith the fifth title actually running first. The correct order is "The Contract", "Countess Margie", "Honeyboy Honeywell", "Margie's Mink", "Shipboard Story", "Who's Married". A little confusing but it eventually dawned on me that I wasn't seeing the episodes I had selected from the menu.A minor issue to me secondary to having nice quality copies of these rare episodes - just an FYI.
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	1	0	This was finally released last month on Region 1 DVD under the film's original title, Dark Angel. (Previously available only from UK or Australia).
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	1	1	May not win the best movie title award but is actually named after the book so that's how that goes.Disney continues to bring a high standard to it's TV movie productions and this is one of their best.It's about friendship, loyalty, integrity and challenges one to look beyond social status facadesto see the real person.Heart-warming, well-acted and memorable!
A1AR7TJ81Y1V54	0	1	Just give us the matches/programs and spare us the biased spin. Eventually, after Vince McMahon is out of the picture, they'll begin making the old programming available - not just WCW but all the other archives and promotions he's swallowed up and buried in the "Vince vault". On a more positive note nice to see these old matches even in agenda slanted selections and at least this set doesn't just skip an entire year or two like the last one! Just kidding - it does.
A1ARARB4YO0I4J	0	0	The pieces in this book are printed in such a small font that they are almost unreadable. This book is only good as a reference. Also, a book this size should have a spiral binding.
A1ARARB4YO0I4J	1	0	The Gabriel Cosmetics website has colors on it that don't exactly match the actual color of the lipstick. Maybe this is a problem with my (old) computer monitor. It would be a good idea to call the company before ordering any color to find out what it REALLY looks like.
A1ARDY1D7PJ5R1	1	1	This movie is quite simply one of the best told, best produced and most uplifting tales ever made on film. The story of the main character, as told through a series of flashbacks during a vicious police torture session, is as compelling as it is brutal especially to American audiences unfamiliar with the realities of India's deep religious and ethnic rifts. In addition, the superb stagecraft by Boyle and his talented cast and crew gives the viewer a palpable sense of the depth of poverty from which the characters emerge, something very alien and most likely unbelievable to suburban Americans who consider a ten-hour power outage something akin to living in caves. The true beauty of this film, however, is the steely resilience and imaginative machinations once the children are orphaned and forced to eke out a living in spite of "considerable" obstacles. This movie will move you in ways you've never imagined. It left my wife and I exhausted by the magnitude of the forces overcome and it also left us in a puddle of tears. ps- I NEVER cry at movies &lt;wink>
A1ARDY1D7PJ5R1	0	0	This "book" is of such poor quality that reading it from front cover to the footnotes is more challenging than the thought of consuming the flesh of fellow travelers in the mountains. It doesn't even include an ISBN for inclusion in the Library of Congress. The ASCII font was the first tip-off that the reader was indeed trapped in the Donner Pass of literature. The only tragedy was the money we lost by buying this book.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	So Factions was the second in the Guild Wars series of games. It's story line and environment bear no connection with the first Guild Wars (aka Guild Wars: Prophecies) save the fact that a player who owns both games may "bridge" a character from Factions over to the original campaign at about the 1/2 mark (the location called Lions Arch in Prophecies) and the reverse is also true, you are able to bring Prophecies characters over to factions. All the Guild Wars games are linked together in this way to add value and perks for players willing to invest in the entire series and in this case those perks are very good, but more on that in a bit.So with Factions we have an Asian themed world that resembles ancient China. Although personal taste varies, many find factions to be the most beautiful of the Guild Wars series. The environments are vast, colorful and inspiring. Here we have all the original GW character classes plus two new classes. Assassin and Ritualism, both play very differently than previous classes.Regarding the game experience: Factions moves along faster than the first guild wars, there is no "pre-searing" tutorial that last for days in this game. Instead you'll start on a small island that will quickly challenge solo players to seek assistance. You will level up quickly and you'll find yourself around 16-17 before leaving the "beginners" island. Once you arrive on the mainland you'll find yourself with level 20 henchmen with plenty of 3000 xp quest to get them to level 20 (for those that don't know, level 20 is the highest level a character can ascend to in GW. Playing through the first guild wars game, most players will not reach level 20 until 3/4's of the way through the game.While the idea of getting to level 20 quickly sounds appealing it should be noted that it doesn't come easy, you will likely need help to get through these missions and if you want to play the game through it's required to get to level 20 quickly to move on. It's just a very different approach to play that ArenaNet has taken with this game. I believe of the three games available, Factions is the most difficult.Should I buy Factions or Nightfall next?This is the big question a lot of GW players face. My advice is to pick both of them up and to do so before you finish Prophecies. If you can only afford one of the two I would say get Nightfall, because you can bring your can bring you characters over and get Heros (they replace henchmen, you get to keep them), which provide an entirely new play dynamic to the game and will help you out greatly when other human players aren't available. Also Nightfall has better elite skills.The main benefit of Factions is the fast leveling, but again you'll have to work for it.Get them both and you'll have both benefits.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	0	1	So Blizzard has made more money off World Of Warcraft than any game in history and the former Diablo II team members who did not move over to work on World of Warcraft left to form ArenaNet and make Guild Wars (an excellent series of game I might add), pretty much the rest of that team later left Blizzard to form Flagship Studios and to make their vision of what Diablo 3 should have been and that game is Hellgate: London.So how is it? If you liked Diablo 2, it won't take much, the controls will take some getting use to, but the concepts and even a lot of the UI look from Diablo II has carried over here. This is all good, except that the genre has really innovated beyond Diablo 2. Since it appears Diablo 2 will never get a real successor, I would say Guild Wars which came out in 2005 (still alive and relevant today through an expansion and new campaigns) is as good as you can get and it really improved upon several of Diablo's flaws.Hellgate feels a lot like Diablo 2, but it also feels dated. The graphics just a touch sub-par for their system requirements I would say and overall there's just a feeling that the game was rushed. It feels like you're playing a beta product. The voice overs often seem misplaced and plan bad. The map has no compass and reviewing your quest log is a bit of a hassle. The control is tight, but you can be running fine at 60fps and get mobbed my enemies and drop down to 10fps. The problem I have against Hellgate is a collection of little things that add up to make it overall far short of the fantastic title it could have been.You would think at least they got the multi-player part right, but they did not.. and they want to charge for a guild and basic multi-player ideas that are available free in other games.Having said that, if you skip newer games like Guild Wars and go from into Hellgate from (the now very old) Diablo 2, you probably won't realize what all you're missing and may enjoy it a great deal more than I have so far.Overall not recommended.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	I recieved a pair v-moda vibe earbuds as a holiday gift. I try to be very discerning about: speakers, headphones, earbuds etc... My reference points are a pair of $500 studio monitors and and a $300 pair of Ultimate Ear in-ear monitor earbuds designed for professional stage use.I'm happy to report that the V-MODA vibe headphones turned out to exceed my expectations. Although I generally can find something critical to say about a product, in this case about the only thing I can come up with is to criticize the flux leather carry case that comes in the box. Everything else here is perfect and I believe for $100 these are the most well crafted, best sounding ear buds money can buy. Their aesthetics (arguably a work of art in design) are certainly a bonus, but don't mistake these for style over substance, with the vibe earbuds you truely get both.COMFORT:The cushy rubber ends are provided in three sizes in both black and translucent white (for a total of six pieces in the box) the medium size set that came attached out of the box happened to fit my ears best. These are the most comfortable earbuds I have worn. The design of the ear pieces also cancel noise without completely blocking it better than ANY earbuds I have tried.POWER:The V-MODA Vibe apparently house some powerful magnets, I have a set or $60 SONY phones and a pair of $40 Phillips earbuds and they both require a great deal more volume to produce sound levels achieved at low-mid volume with the vibe phones. I would rate them excellent in this category as well.SOUND QUALITY:The sound here is crisp and clear a respectable 12Hz - 22kHz provides a glistening range of EQ without overloading the low end and turning everything to mud as so many ear bud makers tend to do. Would I replace my Ultimate Ears with these? No, but for everyday listening the VIBEs are excellent, much better than the Apple supplied earbuds that came with my iPod, much better than anything else you can get in this price range and the higher priced buds aren't designed nearly as well IMO.SUPPORT:A week after opening them one of my kids managed to remove one of the clear rubby ear pieces. I wrote V-MODA support on a Friday evening and Sunday (on a weekend mind you) I got a response back saying there were sending out a new set free of charge. Again, in the area of product support V-MODA scores excellent.Highly recommended as iPod earbuds replacements or general purpose ear buds (I use mine on my notebook PC and my pod daily).
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	There are two sides of Bruce Springsteen, we have Bruce Springsteen the solo artist who gives us folk albums and then we have Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street which give us rock albums.So on this episode of Storytellers we find Bruce Sprintsteen the solo artist giving us insight into songs (some popular others much less known) that span his career as an artist in general. Bruce treats the show as if his audience are aspiring songwriters. He delves into how he approaches the craft of songwriting more than focusing on the individual stories and I think that's why I really enjoyed it so much.Aspiring songwriters will likely watch this one over and over again, casual fans and fans of the more up tempo side of Bruce may be disappointed.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	Line6 is a company that revolutionized professional grade studio guitar processing in the late 1990's with the original POD... Studio musicians from New York to Nashville began praising this little red box they could carry around in their backpack and into the studio instead of the usual crate of amps... Yes, the POD sounded THAT good. Since it's introduction, Line6 has revised the POD every few years to improve features, the Pocket POD technology (processing chips) are identical to the POD 2.0, the sound you get is the same grade... the only difference is the size of the unit and the Pocket POD is missing some of the more high-end input/outputs (MIDI, foot switch control, etc...) other than that, the Pocket POD is a second generation POD with a budget price tag. So here you get professional studio grade amp simulation and effects for under $150 and you can carry this around in your pocket.Now putting the core technology (which is very good) aside and getting into features. The Pocket POD comes with an excellent set of presets. You can select by BAND, STYLE or USER. As I mentioned, the POD is used by professional musicians, BAND presets are presets created with direct input from the pros. Want to dial up Hoobastanks guitarist sound on The Reason? It's already programmed for you along with about a dozen others artist presets created by the artist themselves.There are many more STYLE presets, style presets are approximation of specific artist recorded tone on specific songs, they have names easy to reconize like: CRAZY TRAIN, JUMP, FREE FALLIN, DUST WIND, SANDMAN, ANOTHER BRICK, WHOLE LOTTA LOVE etc.. Most of them sound fantastic.Just dial up a specific tone patch then use one of the four silver knobs to adjust: Gain, Effect Level, Delay Level and Volume. There are so many of these presets many guitarist will probably never even bother to "deep edit", but for those who want more, Line6 has a free program that you can download for MacOS X and Windows that allows you to build your own presets and store them in the Pocket POD. The Pocket POD connects to a PC through an included USB cable and then the user can select a specific amp head, amp cabinet, add effects, etc... You can build your own virtual guitar rig and then store it in one of the included user preset spots.CONNS:The "deep edit" software I mentioned above does not work on many notebook PCS and will not work through USB hubs. This will leave many users wanting more frustrated. Also, no power supply is included and the battery life here isn't good. User manual is essentially 3 pages printed in many languages, no manual for the software (and how hard would it have been to include it on a CD-ROM in the box?)
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	Some history on this device: The Alesis SR-16 has been in production since 1991 and has gone through only slight revisions to the hardware since its original release. The 16-bit drum samples are still the same today as they were on this unit over 15 years ago. It is regarded as a break-through piece of studio gear and regarded by many studio engineers as the first rhythm machine capable of producing a convincing enough drum track capable of replacing a real drummer in studio recordings for rock applications. (Prior to the SR-16, rhythm machines were commonly used in pop music in the 80's, but it was always clear to trained ears that a rhythm machine was used, the SR-16 successfully blurred the line and made it possible to use rhythm machines in genres that generally frowned upon electronic drums such as: rock, country and blues) You'll hear the SR-16 on many professional tracks by top name recording artist from the early to mid-90's.Today the SR-16 can still be found in many professional and home recording studios. With the emergence of Pro Tools and other PC based Digital Audio Workstations, stand alone rhythm machines have become much less popular today in pro recording, but they are still very popular in home studios and for performing solo musicians around the world.Comparing the SR-16 to newer products: Rhythm machines produced by Roland/BOSS, Yamaha and ZOOM are the SR-16's primary competition, with Roland and Alesis often cited as leaders and innovators in pro electronic percussion (these companies also produce the best quality electronic kits and the same samples are used in their rhythm machine products). Some of the features common to newer rhythm machines not found on the SR-16 include: 24-bit samples, more memory, bass guitar sequencer ability to store MIDI files on device.Ease of use: Aside from its convincing sound quality, perhaps the reason the SR-16 has remained in production and a favorite among musicians is its ease of use. The SR-16 was designed with the non-drummer solo musician in mind and is considered one of the easiest rhythm machines to program. It's interface has been copied (but many would say not trumped) by BOSS, Yamaha and others. The manual, while poorly edited does more than any other rhythm machine owners guide to cater to solo musician who doesn't understand the first thing about sequencing drum tracks and it's A,FillA,B,FillB pattern foot switch configuration makes it easier to improvise with... In short, you don't get much customization with the SR-16, but what you do get feature was is going to be the most popular setup which makes the device much more approachable than many modern rhythm machines and sequencer options. Has a full MIDI in/out through implementation so the SR-16 can be patched in and controlled from DAW's (Pro Tools, Cubase, Live, etc...)Comparing generations: If you're buying previously owned model be aware that some features have changed over the years. First generation SR-16 models (1991-circa 2001) had about 1/2 of the user memory than that of the current production SR-16. Also, the first generation units did not have a headphone jack. In the early 2000's Alesis updated all the preset patterns creating a market for "vintage" SR-16 machines. Also, over the years the price has dropped significantly. The SR-16 was originally marketed as a high-end studio product with a price tag around $400. While the quality of the unit has only improved, the price has dropped as computer parts have become less expensive (also newer units are mass produced in Asia).
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	Only pros here:* Very reasonably priced* Excellent setup/software bundle (I was able to setup 8 devices 4 of which were going through a remote controlled splitter/switch system in about 20 minutes with no frustration from the software)* Create multiple macros (i.e. One touch, everything on and ready) which you can rename using the software.* Great list of supported remote profiles (it was able to support a rather obscure component cable/optical switch device as well as a off-brand Dynex iPod docking station)* Excellent phone supportShort summary: I have eight IR controlled devices in my Home Theater setup with fairly complex configurations (e.g. Blu-Ray player and XBox 360 both going into Video 2 on my TV controlled by an IR controlled switch). The software that comes with the 550 is not perfect, but it is very, very good. I found it easy to locate my devices and then to batch togeather a group of task to be sent and tie those to one-touch keys.After about 20-minutes I now have the ability to: turn on all my device, adjust my switches and imputs in a single click. I can do this for any fuction I want (e.g. Watch TV, Watch DVD, Play 360, Play PS2, Play Wii). This remote did exactly what I was looking for and it did so about 35% of the price I was expecting to have to pay. It's not the most flashy remote on the market, but it does its job well and it's very affordable comparitively.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	0	1	... I understand Bill is an outspoken Atheist in a culture where it is highly frowned upon to be Atheist. I think many of the questions and points he raises in this documentary are important... Religion can be a poison, religion can empower a select few who use it to manipulate, in the name of religion wars have been waged... I understand how to Bill and to other Atheist and Agnostics all religious figures could be grouped togeather, but my understanding and acceptance of Bill's ideas really stops there. I am a Christian and if we met I certainly wouldn't push my views in your face. While I don't have any miracles to tell you about, I can tell you about the things my Church is doing in our community to help single mothers, to build homes for the homeless and to provide food for the hungry. I can tell you that at these events our beliefs aren't pushed on anyone we help. I can you that if you were to pick up a Christian Bible and read the story of Jesus found in the gospels in the New Testament that you would discover a religious figure with some very unique attributes. For example, unlike Buddha or Mohammad, or well any other religious figure we find someone claiming to actually be God incarnate into man and we find that this person didn't like religion much either. In fact the religious leaders of his time hated him. Jesus's message wasn't one of hate it was a message of love. I know that sounds incredibly simple and I'm not trying to insult anyone. I understand if you have a real problem with that from every logical stand point, I would too (I'm an Engineer and a rather logical thinker)... All I can tell you is that my beliefs and non-denominational church give me a deep sense of peace and happiness that it would be impossible to describe. My social group and closest circle of friends consist of people with varied religious views, so there is no criteria for cult-like activity. You are free to believe all my experiences are chemical reactions. I think you're wrong, we could go round and round, let's not. The fact is there are many, many churches that are not the extreme organizations you see here that are a positive force in the world. Has religion been twisted and corrupted and used for a great deal of pain in this world, the answer is YES. Is 'religion' really the path to God? The answer the No. At it's best religion provides a means for like believers to join togeather and accomplish positive things in society and the world in general. At it's worst it's a destructive and negative force. We live in a imperfect world, trying to poke fun at region and only point out it's flaws comes across more than a bit pretentious. Collectively it's religion that moves this world. In fact if you really think about the force of religion, The Agnostic and Athesit point of view is one of pretension and retreat. Just because there is no clear answer doesn't mean it's all wrong. The truth I've found is very simple, God doesn't need religion to reach people and faith in God is a very personal thing that must be detached from religion. Inside each person there is a longing to connect with God. The more logical minded and gifted often react to this with a resentment and 'prove you're real' attitude. But if you stop and think about it, if there is an all knowing God in the Christian sense he's certainly big enough to take your cursing at him and fist waving hatred for him (which actually manifest itself in hatred for believers) He's capable of taking all of that from you ever day of your life then at the very end still loving you... After all, if such a God exist then it would have to understand your logical needs. So how does an Agnostic find this God? I think the answer is in the Bible, Matthew 7:7-8 - Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. (NIV). The problem the agnostic and atheist face is getting past their hate for Christians and God and being open minded enough to accept that something just might be there... Here's a final thought: If this was a God that created everything according to Christian ideology, wouldn't everything we know about Science, Math, Physics, the known Universe seem incredibly small and petty? Would it really be possible to connect with such a being in terms of Science, Math, Physics, et al. that we as humans have come to understand at this point in our growth? Perhaps, but isn't it more likely that everything we have would be so primitive in comparison that we really couldn't qualify such a beings existence. Some of our brightest physicist believe theories of multiple dimensions, who's to say they are wrong and that this God lives in ours... Isn't plausible there are things we just haven't figured out yet and that the things we can explain (e.g. chemical reactions in the brain that provide explanation for religious experience) are the tip of the ice berg and that there is something much more going on that we simply don't have the science to explain...
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	1	My previous viewing of Amadeus was in a college classroom presented on VHS format on a large NTSC tube television. In that sitting the film came across as best it could I suppose, I saw a bit of the genius in Shaffer's screenplay, however it was less than grand and at times very difficult to hear the actors clearly (not to mention a muffled soundtrack). Looking for older movies on Blu I was excited to hear about this film. I knew it had the potential to be an excellent example of why Blu-Ray matters and I'm very happy Warner Bros gave this package treatment worthy of 5 stars.Given the right equipment, a Blu-Ray viewing of Amadeus is incredible. The Doulby TrueHD lossless audio is excellent and the 1080p picture quality almost as good. Considering the lack of quality, properly calibrated displays in theaters when this film was released in the mid 80's; as with many classics released on Blu-Ray, a home theater viewing will be like the first time seeing this film for many.The Blu-Ray book package contains the Directors Cut of the film along with many bonus features on the first disc. It also contains a digital copy of the movie on a DVD (data) disc which is copy-protected Windows Media format standard definition, lastly it contains an audio CD containing some of Mozart's most memorable pieces of music.Some films deserve nothing less than the best quality audio and video possible and this is one of those movies. If you're even a casual fan of classical music this is one purchase you will not regret.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	1	0	I don't think it's any coincidence that the packaging of this 3-disc set is rather neutral and could represent either edition of the film.So my four star rating is in consideration of everything you're getting here: the original 1951 classic film (presented in remastered High Definition: the picture quality and transfer is absolutely amazing) and you also get the new 2008 Keanu Reeves remake. The remake is not a very a good movie. On it's own, I would only give it two stars. This is a real shame as the acting and special effects are both rather good here. Keanu is often criticized, but I thought he played this part extreemly well. But decent acting and great special effects won't help a poor script (and it's actually the changes I had a problem with, the original script is rather good). The ending seems abrupt and almost driven by budget issues. I would imagine the actors involved felt a bit let down by the finished product.For a while I had been considering buying the classic version of this film, this packages cost the same and comes with the remake. When you think of it on those terms it is a good value.
A1ARIIDS0IPYLC	0	0	The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.GuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.Regarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc.. the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)Overall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!Only two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument. Overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed.
A1ARLX8NEBQ55K	1	1	these earrings have such a vibrant wine color and can go with any other earrings i have on. only reason i give it four stars is that it really irritated my ears after a couple of days, so people with sensitive ears beware.
A1ARLX8NEBQ55K	1	1	This ring is so unique style yet still such a fabulous look to it. A ring that takes one look and know then ya gotta buy it. Within the ring had a variety of different ambers, the green is my favorite, but so hard to find, though it's in this ring. Just make sure to get the right size, because the band is real thick and it will take some work to adjust it later.
A1ARLX8NEBQ55K	0	0	I always loved finding cheats for games and so i thought purchasing this would make it easier for me. At first I was amazed of how much good cheats there were and ones I couldn't find on gaming sites. All I had to do was start up the Ar Max, go on expert mode, find the game I had, select the cheat codes, press start, then switch it to the game. When I tried it on one game, everything was fine and cheat codes were really fun. But the second time I used it, I noticed the game was acting funny, freezing and sometimes refused to start up at all. I thought I was playing the game too much, so I tried another game and was using other cheats from Ar Max. This time I played, I was enjoying it until the second play through AGAIN it happened. Every time I insert the game, my Playstation 2 would make these struggling noises and it would refuse to read the game disc. I would check the discs which found no scratches then re-insert them, but ended up with the same results. I was so frustrated of the damage the Ar Max did, so now I have two of my games completely ruined.So don't buy this, it's a rip off, and you will end up with messed up game discs!

A1AS5JILVJQ957	0	1	My four year old really struggles with this scooter. Sure, it doesn't go fast. The wheels seem uptight on purpose. But with the two wheels in the front, and the design of the handlebars, it makes it difficult to steer, too. And when my younger son gets too tired and cranky to propel himself back home from the park, the handlebar is impossible for me to help him out, because I end up mis-steering all over and running over toes.I much prefer theSpider-Man Preschool 3-Wheeled Scootermy older son wore out between age 2 and 5. It had 2 wheels in the back and one in front, with Razor-type straight handlebar, which I found at a steep discount. When he got tired of propelling himself (not often), I could just grab and pull myself. I even got my own two-wheeled Razor scooter that he inherited, and we rode together with me sometimes pulling him along, on his three-wheeled scooter from another brand.I don't recommend the Radio Flyer. I've been disappointed with both the scooter and the tricycle's cheap materials and impossible maneuvering.
A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	I've been using my Titan Freestyle Suspension Pro Scooters for two and a half years.I can easily steer my scooter with one hand as I guide my little boyz' scooters or bikes with my other hand. I've taken my young boys to the park, to school, and to various nearby lessons with it as they ride their bikes or their own Razors.However ... As the other reviewer said, I do have a LOT of trouble getting the latch to unhook. Maybe it's made for giant Titan hands, not normal human beings like me. I tried WD-40: I can't remember it helping much, and I shouldn't have to carry that everywhere. As a result, I never fold it anymore. I just park it standing up.As with any scooter, watch out for your ankles. If you ever have to walk the scooter (across grass, or in a school zone) tipping the steering shaft forward can result in the wheelbase rotating into ankle bones with bruising results. Wear basketball shoes with ankle padding to protect your ankles.I bought two Titans at once - titanium for my hubby and golden for myself. The Titan's 300-pound capacity sold me, even if you're half or two thirds of it. By comparison, theRazor A Kick Scootertouted a 143-pound capacity.Happy with the adjustable height steering shaft, the excellent brakes, and the suspension. Dear hubby changed out the wheel bearings for me so I wouldn't go so fast but would get a better workout. I don't recommend that for everyone, but it's as easy to do as with any other scooter or skate, and you pros may go with even faster bearings but it's not necessary - plenty fast as is.I just wish it was easier to fold and secure.(Hey product managers, what would it hurt to re-design this with a "hole" on the handlebars where we could attach a "bike" lock for use with a bike rack at school or in town? It could double as a hook for a D-ring carabiner or even stunt stuff.)
A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	Erik Davis has proposed that forms of communication shape social and individual consciousness of reality. IMHO, Techgnosis is worth another look now that social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) has spread so rampantly across our culture. The tracks of what we have followed tends now to define what is presented to us.In a nutshell, "Different forms of communication -- oracular performance, writing, print, television, email - shape social and individual consciousness along specific lines, creating unique networks of perceptions, experiences, and interpersonal possibilities that help shape the social construction of reality. From this it follows that when a culture's technical structure of communication mutates quickly and significantly, both social and individual "reality" are in for a bit of a ride. ...The social imagination leaps into the breach, unleashing a torrent of speculation, at once cultural, metaphysical, technical, and financial. These speculations inevitably take on a utopian and feverish edge. ...However much we aspire to embody the rationalism of our machines, we cannot escape this feedback loop between techne [sic] and dream."Categorized under Technology, Techgnosis is rich with the name-dropping, "Spunk and Bite" style, and mystical leanings that may appeal to Grunge crowds, old New Agers, and intellectuals. Oh, and it is of interest to historians, communication and media technology students, information technologists, millenialists, conspiracy theorists, and religious seekers.Keep in mind this was originally written before the turn of 2000, even before the Wachowski brothers brought us The Matrix. I first read it in '98, when it helped me blaze a few new trails in my path. But there's plenty of thought here with staying power.It's a 3000-year history, tracing technology's influence on human thought and expression, especially regarding self, spirit, soul and society. "...a secret history of the mystical impulses that continue to spark and sustain the Western world's obsession with technology, and especially with its technologies of communication." The outline below shows the depth and breadth of this book.Questions worth discussing:Are we automatons? Why? How might we wake up? What would we gain?How has free communication and press advanced or hindered human evolution?Are UFO sightings and abductions our sublimated hopes for utopia, and our dread of the need to adapt?Does physical complexity breed more intelligent consciousness? Can the Net live?Does the Net breed collective intelligence as tribe did collective unconscious?Is biotechnology & AI doomed to go on the fritz eventually?

A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	I am a big fan of Michio Kaku. We see him everywhere now in the tradition of Carl Sagan, while TV documentaries flourish on cable.Hyperspace was my first exposure to Haku. He's an extremely readable science writer. Hyperspace illustrates modern physics for the non-scientist.My favorite takeaway: what we know as God may exist in the 10th dimension or so.
A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	Rites of passage essential to every epic, every religion's basis: call, refusal, trials, atonement, boon, perilous return, mastery of 2 worlds. Explains how the Good News is common to other religions.
A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	The Heroine's Journey draws from epic tales to propose a set of women's rites of passage:* rejecting the feminine* "daddy's girl" identifying with the masculine* road of trials* illusion of success* betrayal or refusing authority* initiation and descent* reconnection with the feminine* healing the madwoman/mother/daughter split* letting go of machisma in favor of completion in sacred marriage* integrating dualityHat tip and recommended reading:The Hero With a Thousand Faces (Bollingen Series, No. 17) (v. 6).Compare to the hero's rites of passage (call, refusal, trials, atonement, boon, perilous return, mastery of 2 worlds), The Heroine's Journey is much shorter and lighter.But there are some lessons here that I would like Pixar, Dreamworks, Hollywood, Blizzard Entertainment, and RockStar Games to digest and present to the world.
A1AS5JILVJQ957	1	1	Every epic and every good screenplay cycles us through rites of passage: separation, initiation, integration, reward, attachment, regression, alienation, and misery/death.Hat tip to and recommended reading:The Hero With a Thousand Faces (Bollingen Series, No. 17) (v. 6)
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	0	0	If you do not mind working with a smaller ball (smaller than the picture and smaller than a basketball) go ahead and buy this Medicine ball. I coach youth basketball and we were very disappointed when we took this little ball out of the box. It does weigh four pounds...however, the pictures were deceptive. I need a ball near the size of a basketball. Very disappointed.
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	1	1	AMAZING. You can not take it all in in one sitting. There is so much to learn and to teach others that you will find yourself returning to this DVD again and again. Highly recommended! Did I say AMAZING!
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	1	1	I was looking for a book on Psalms. I found two un-related books which share the exact same ISBN number:9780842313384I thought you might want to know about this. If you order your books using ISBN numbers, you may get the wrong book.Please, no need to reply. Have an excellent day.
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	1	1	Excellent lessons. Please take your time and pray at every opportunity to pray. Look at how your daughter reacts (reflects) during each lesson. Stop at every chance you see to pray for her soul, her heart, her love for Christ. Don't be in a hurry to finish a lesson. Take small bites. Ask gentle but honest questions. Be patient. Teach our youth to love Jesus. When they love Jesus, and see Jesus in us...they will listen, even when we think they are not listening. We as parents have to live the life we teach. God bless you.
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	1	1	Texture, seasonings, most excellent. The only chip I choose to eat! If you find a store that has Jays Sour Cream and onion Potato chips, email me at mr_mikematthews@yahoo.com! I can not find them anywhere!

A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	1	1	Truly a treasure for all time, all peoples, all to the glory of God. Feast on God's goodness, wrath, power, beauty, faith, justice, judgment......amazing read. A MUST FOR MATURE CHRISTIANS. READ PRAYERFULLY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	0	1	The Fall of Man and the Perfect Salvation................Poor Theology....RUN FROM THIS BOOK! I highly recommend that you buy some other book. If you read this book, and reflect on the scriptures....the exposition is poor. The exposition on the cited scriptures are sooooo spiritual and contrary to solid Biblical interpretation. RUN!!!!
A1ASFNSZ8RLB8B	0	0	[...]I would not recommend this book. Russell does make some remarkable findings, however, his theology is corrupt and he is a party to a cult.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	This series has some good moments, but the storytelling is lumpy (a seven episode flashback?) and the internal logic is really sloppy.However, the deal breaker is that it doesn't end--it simply stops. This is not an exaggeration. When I got the the end of disk 8, I went to the box to get the next one...and there wasn't one. It just...stops. Right before the Big Climax.Unacceptable!Seriously, this is like going to a movie and having the last reel missing. You can't win either way--either you like the series, in which case you'll feel robbed by the "ending," or it's not something you'll like, in which case why buy it?So I recommend you save your money until the alleged next series comes out to complete the story. However, it's been a couple of years and so far no word on another series, so, as Dirty Harry would say: "Do ya feel lucky?"
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	A pleasant enough series, but it does not end--it simply stops. It like there is another disk missing. As such I can give it only 1 star.A pity, but there you go.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	I was cautiously looking forward to the A&E; Andromeda Strain series. I loved the book and the Wise movie, but the SFX needed updating, and making it a miniseries would let more of the story be told.What a fool I was.It's grotesquely bad. Aside from the moonbat content slathered on with a trowel, the original was a SCIENTIFIC thriller. That's what made it unusual and extraordinary..and a multimillion-selling book that remains in print after nearly four decades. So the Hollywood bozos, not understanding the concept, sort of hand-wave the science with a bunch of incorrectly-used buzzwords, and then drag out the PC/liberal playbook for making a generic Hollywood action flick. Men stupid and bad (liberal men are...tolerable). Woman wise and good. Military stupid and evil. Media wise and noble. Bush lied! Save the planet! Etcetera ad nauseum. (Seriously, the amount of PC/enviro/liberal/moonbat crap akwardly jammed into the film is amazing.) The dialog sounds like a bowl of lumpy oatmeal. One of the reasons the original book and movie were so scary is that they tried to convince you it was all real and plausible. So in this lame version, when the chief scientist starts making open-line cell phone calls to the highly irritating reporter/meth-head from a "sooper-dooper top secret locked-down hush-hush underground military bio-science lab," all you can do is laugh. The final straw in part one is the scientists standing in a meeting room and watching a live feed (!!) from the HUD of an F-16 firing a "nuclear-tipped missile"...which then "accidently" goes off.Then I watched the last part, and it's worse, much worse. First, I'll admit to skipping through chunks on 4x speed, but I'll bet I didn't miss anything worth seeing. Basically, Andromeda is supposedly a warning sent from the future to stop us from "raping the planet." The film then disintegrates into hysterically awful SF gibberish about wormholes and most of the ending violates every law of physics and common sense I can think of. Example: the water coolant pool over the core of the nuclear reactor at the bottom of Wildfire is OPEN TO THE AIR (water reactors have to be sealed because they operate at about 70 atmospheres of pressure and 785 degrees F). There's even worse, trust me. I could go on and on and on....All in all, it was the worst SF movie I've ever seen that wasn't made in the 50s (or direct to video), and Michael Crichton has every right to track down the screenwriter and club him to a pulp with a copy of the bloated script.Not only am I annoyed they've ruined this hoped-for update, I'm even more annoyed that because they've pi55ed in the pool and now there probably won't be a good remake of the original for another decade or more. May they sprout a fulminating carbuncle in their nads.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	Itami almost never disappoints and his skills have taken a big leap in this film since the time he made "Tampopo" (another must-see movie). A clever script gives a look inside a world must of us will never know--the high-end tax evasion and political corruption that finance the upper ranks of Japan. I spent several years in Japan (and learned more than I wanted, frankly, about the tax system) but this is a level I never saw, although I heard and read a lot about it, and Itami is not exaggerating here. These things really happen!The actors are all wonderful, cast to perfection and fitting with Itami's slightly slapstick style perfectly.Now if they'd just get "A Taxing Woman 2" out on DVD--it's 90%+ as good as this one--I'd be a happy man. And I'd be twice as happy if they'd re-release "Minbo no Onna," Itami's brilliant film about the yakuza extortion rackets. It got the yakuza so mad at him he was attacked and stabbed outside his home by a yakuza "street soldier."Actually, I was surprised to see his relatively weak 1996 effort, "Super no Onna" is out on DVD, and these other, superior, films are not. Licensing decisions can be a real mystery.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	My old 8000 series Braun got left in a hotel room, so I figured I'd upgrade. However, this model does not shave my beard as well as the older model. My beard hairs grown in all directions and lay very flat. The Pulsonic had a tendency to yank them out, and it took pass after pass to get an area shaved clean. I finally gave it to my Dad (he's got a more normal beard and it works fine for him) and just bought a 8985 model, which works great.So, be forewarned--this shaver might not work well for you, and it's NON-RETURNABLE.However, it's very well made and seems to work great for my father, so I feel I need to give it four stars.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	I didn't expect much, but I bought this album out of sheer nostalgia. Listening to the first track I was horrified, and even thought I might have the wrong CD. But then it takes off and...what fun! Blondie is back.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	0	...so I have to take off one star.I don't have much to say about this true anime classic that other reviewers have not already said. If you like anime, even if you are a recent convert, watch this movie. Like the best of Miyazaki's work, it's truly special.It desperately deserves a new release from a proper widescreen master, but sadly, I doubt it will ever get one. I finally bought the Japanese R2 release just to see it as it should be seen.Finally, while I thought I had seen the worst of Charles Solomon's always incredibly insensitive and retarded anime reviews, this one takes the cake. I wonder who feeds him and changes his diaper? What a clueless bozo. Amazon should be ashamed to continue letting this idiot write anime reviews.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	There seem to be some people who had difficulty following the story. As one of the two translators, I'm in a position to offer some hints (I don't want to simply give it away!).Hint 1: This one is very, very important. In fact, you might try reading it again after taking just this one hint--Look at the time stamps closely. You might be surprised....Hint 2: Not everything moves the core plot ahead. If something seems to you to be a red herring or side story, it probably is.Bonus Hint 1: Consider the primary tenets of quantum physics.Bonus Hint 2: Consider the work of physicist John Stewart Bell--"Reality is non-local."Good luck. It's worth the effort.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	Pretty much what I said in the title. Rated as a martial arts movie, it might be five stars, but the plot is so stunning retarded I had to whack off a star.Not as many stunts as the average Chan film, but the fights are perhaps the best in all his movies. His fight with Benny "The Jet" Urquidez has to be seen to be believed. Some of Sammo's best work, too.My favorite quote:Sammo: "They're tough!"Jackie: "They're SUPER tough!"Sammo: "Let's run!"
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	An amazing film that is inexplicably unavailable in NTSC. I might have to order the PAL and convert it myself, although that is a serious pain. American distributors, wake up!!
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	I'm a big fan of Glass's music (which is why I hugely enjoy reading the reviews that bash his work--they're like reading the spoiled rantings of children who don't understand something).That said, I hadn't heard this recording since I got on on LP. The music is great, but Glass is not the greatest piano player. I look forward to a re-recording by a full-time pianist.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	1	If I wanted music with stream noises I'd have ordered that. Where are the pure nature sounds? What idiot thought anyone would want some dopey new age rubbish "music" added?
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	0	I don't have anything important to add the the other reviews. Great album, too long neglected. I deducted one star for poor audio quality, although that may be a bit unfair.I'd been watching for it on CD for ages and finally gave up. Now, in 2009, I remembered to check again, and it was out briefly, then discontinued, and now $49.95 used.I gritted my teeth and paid it, but from now on I'll check for unissued albums more often.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	In years of study, I've found nothing better than this exhaustive study. I rarely give 5 star reviews, but this book deserves it.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	From the fact that the introduction is written by a notorious socialist and "progressive" activist, you can just guess where the author is coming from. I suspect she had the book half-written in her head before she even set out on her little journey.I'm not going to go into all the problems with the book by example, but try to provide and overall impression.As has been noted by other reviewers, she was amazingly profligate with her money, and seemed to have no concept of budgeting and saving. She seems to have gone into this to try and live a middle-class life on minimum wage and was astonished to find it impossible. Or, more likely, she did everything she could to "prove" it was impossible and thus "prove" her thesis that America sucks and millions of hard-working and intelligent people are trapped like rats in dead-end jobs. A couple of hints, dear: minimum wage is a starter wage. It's not really meant to be lived on. Either you move up through hard work or training, or, what do you know, you get paid like an untrained beginner. As for raising family on minimum wage...what insanity. If you can't afford a family--and on minimum wage, you cannot--then, um, don't have one until you CAN afford it. An astounding concept, I know, but something to think about. I have noted that almost every person I have met who is "stuck" in a low-paying job is not "future-oriented," as they say. This is a nearly fatal flaw in terms of getting ahead in life.And guess what, some people are not worth much more than minimum wage. Some are lazy, incompetent, of low intelligence, or have some other issue that means they'll never make the money a neurosurgeon does. I fail to see why this situation is such an outrage. It just seems obvious.As for people who really need help, America has a half-trillion dollars worth of programs to help, "donated" by people who pay taxes. No low-income earner in America need starve, because we have food stamps. Or go without shelter because we have low-income housing. Or go without medical care because we have Medicaid. And so on.I've been flat broke in America twice, and once in Japan. All three times I managed to pull it together and get back on my feet and start all over again. In the end, I managed to make as an entrepreneur. Of course, it took years of seven day weeks, sometimes 14-hour days, and it was seven years before I took my first vacation. Heck, it took me three years to buy a car! So I know what it takes to succeed, and government handouts are not it. In fact, when I was poor, I never took one, not of any kind.For a vastly more realistic idea of the opportunities America offers for someone starting with nothing, read "Scratch Beginnings: Me, $25, and the Search for the American Dream" by Adam W. Shepard. His experience rings true, because I've been there and lived it.Basically, Barbara (despite her claims otherwise) wants equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity. The blunt truth is that people are not equal. As noted above, some will never be more than minimum wage earners. They need to learn to accept that and run their lives accordingly. And some will have the talent and genius to cut a tumor out of someone's brain. That person will be especially well rewarded, and so they should.I'm sorry if this would make me seem heartless to the people, like Barbara, who seem to be incensed by the fact that people are not equal. But since I have become a success, the amount of taxes I've paid has probably done more to help those in need than all of her books and speeches and ivory-tower musings put together.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	I don't give very many five star reviews, but after careful thought, I couldn't give this film anything but. It set out to do something and achieved what it wanted to, 100%.I had been reading O'Malley's books for years, but when I heard Scott Pilgrim was being made into a movie, I just rolled my eyes. As a friend in the comics business once told me, "They're going to screw your book. Just decide how much you want to be paid to get screwed." Now, this isn't as true as it used to be--a new generation of directors who understand comics are finally producing good work, like Watchmen--but it's still the way to bet. Which I why I was surprised when I heard from Bryan that he was pretty excited about it. Still....I was aware the film was being made but was too nervous to keep track of it. Even after it came out I dragged my feet about seeing it, then finally went near the end of the run.And I LOVED it!Not only is it the best possible adaptation of the book, it is pure 100% fun. I was talking to a comic book artist I know and raving about it. He's a HUGE Scott Pilgrim fan and loved it. Then he said: "Too bad it bombed, huh?" I was truly shocked--I had no idea. I couldn't believe how anyone couldn't like the movie. It's imaginative, original, well-written, well-acted, and awesomely, perfectly over-the-top.And now that I have the BR and have rewatched it twice (plus 3x with all the commentaries) I am still agog that it wasn't a huge hit. (Michael Cera has glumly said "We got blindsided by eight guys called The Expendables".) I think the problem some people have with it is that they aren't willing to just go with the flow and accept the strange reality the movie takes place in.Edgar put his heart and soul into this movie and it shows on every frame. I don't know how many times I'd have to watch it to catch all the references and inside jokes, and the backgrounds are so fill of tidbits I've had to step through some scenes almost frame-by-frame in a probably futile attempt to catch them all. The details are amazing, from the note-perfect Bollywood style of the fight with Patel (eg, the demon sisters all have big racks, and if you've ever watched a Bollywood film...) to the promo posters for the bands and the way the lyrics of the music often intercut and play off the script.The actors committed to this film above and beyond the call of duty. Let's face it, training Michael Cera to do long choreographed fight shots and look good doing it must have taken a hell of a lot of work on his part and the part of the fight choreographers. Cera commented that the thing he looked forward to most at the end of filming was "never doing another pushup again in my life." But like them or not, he did them anyway during the filming.And of course for several of the actors, they had to go from wondering what side of their musical instrument was up to playing live and recording the soundtrack. Only Cera and Larson had previous experience, and neither of them professionally. (Larson has a lovely voice!)Cera's acting does the job it needs to. He's pretty Scott Pilgrim-like. (I howled with laughter at his delivery of the line "But it's haaaard!") Culkin steals the movie, as others have noted here. Most of the other parts don't call for ACTING! as much as in most movies, but again, most of the actors do their work. The exception is the clumsy and leaden performance by Anna Kendrick as Stacey Pilgrim. My god, she's awful. But I need to give a special shout-out to Alison Pill who IS Kim Pine. It was almost creepy. Oh yeah, and Jason Schwatzman is brilliant as Gideon. A complete a-hole, just as he should be.I doubt anyone who has read this far (if anyone ever does) is not already a fan of the movie. But talk a few people into watching it with you, or lend out the disk. I think this movie will be a (semi) cult classic, and hopefully after a few years it will at least make its money back. It's just too cruel that Scott Pilgrim vs the World should be a Bob-omb.Scott Pilgrim FTW!
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	This is the book I was hoping to find when I decided to build my own PC. Absolutely fantastic. They aren't afraid to show you what to do when things go wrong (as they did during their sample builds) and let you know how to handle problems as they arise. They are also willing to name names with products and recommend manufacturers known for quality. (ASUS should pay them promotional fees--but ASUS has great reviews across the net, so that's okay.)I reluctantly took one star off because they did not include a suggested build for a PC between Mainstream and Extreme, which happened to be what I wanted. But I was able to use the information they provide for other systems to make my own design and it turned out to be just what I wanted. And another minor niggle--they are a little eager to recommend Linux. While it is a great OS, it requires more computer savvy than they admit. This was not an issue for me, but it might be for others.Seriously, short of having an expert next to you while you build, this book is what you need, and as an added bonus, it's as up to date as is practically possible (as of Jan 2011).
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	Always interesting to read contemporaneous accounts that were meant to be private--you pretty much get the real story. As close as we'll get to time-travel.He's such a stiff and cautious writer, that when he flatly describes the perversions of the Vatican you're stunned. How much went on that he let slide?
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	If you love climbing, you'll love this series. And it's a decent bargain, too.I'll never climb at this level but then I'll never play in the NHL but I still love to play hockey!
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	Not only one of the best manga written, but a fabulous and unexpectedly subtle love comedy with memorable characters. Kyoko is one of the most intriguingly flawed heroines I've ever read, and yet you love her as much as Godai does.Read it. And you'll re-read it many times.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	I was 10 in 1970 and a full-bore SF geek, so I got this as a blast from the past. I enjoyed it, cut it slack for the flaws...and give Gabrielle Drake 11 out of 10 for supreme hotness no matter what she is wearing.The film transfers are jaw-dropping. Someone archived the film with care, something that is sadly rarely done. Then A&E; blew it by running the episodes out of sequence. Sigh.The show is campy, I have to admit, with holes in the plot and continuity you could drive the Andromeda Galaxy through. Yet it has strong moments and at least attempts to have an air of "real" SF. Straker's agonising decision to let his son die instead of failing at his job of protecting humanity is handled well. He's not the machine he sometimes acts like, but suffers greatly because of his decision.Overall I enjoyed watching it again, although I found myself wishing I could go back in time and be magically appointed series editor so I could fix the overall plot arc to be more consistent, clean up continuity errors...and take the "it was all just a dream" episode and kill it with an axe.I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who claim the show reeks with sexism and racism. Women are commonly in positions of authority, and a black man is commander of the Moonbase interceptors (the captain of Skydiver is mixed-race, as well)! In fact, there is a great scene when the black pilot is given a promotion and expresses reluctance to take it due to the fact he feels he won't be taken seriously due to his race. Straker essentially chews him out and says he's getting the job because he's the best man for it, and -- this is this is REAL politically incorrectness!! -- perhaps he should not allow his perception of racism to lay the groundwork for possible excuse-making regarding his performance once he gets the position. Wow. Even now such a line would be shocking.As for the sexy outfits, well, the guys wear some pretty tight jumpsuits (including see-through net shirts on Skydiver) and this WAS the 60s. Women dressed that way as part of the new liberation, the freedom to show their bodies as they pleased. Betty Freidan and Gloria Steinem were proud mini-skirt wearers!And who cares. The more I got to see of the utterly stunning Gabrielle Drake, the better. What a total babe. A shame she left the series during the hiatus.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	This is NOT the Folger edition. It has NO notes of any kind and contains only the text of the play.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	0	0	What else can I say?Maybe the music is good. I'll never know.I have no idea if this is a common problem.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	I'm afraid I'm not enough of a, um, "music critic" to see all the complex problems with this work as described so prolixly by some other reviewers. So let me just say I loved it. Beautiful, fascinating music, beautifully recorded and enthusiastically performed.The flaw? At one of the most quiet and tense moments in the work, some retard in the audience lets out a huge cough. I mean a "drown out the orchestra"-type cough. A minute before or after and it would have been merely annoying. This one shatters the mood and I hope the guy was quietly strangled behind the symphony hall later by Rattle and Maw. I can't help but wonder if there would have been a way for the audio engineer to digitally remove the damn thing some way after the recording.Anyway, if you have a reasonably open mind to modern composers, this is a must-buy. Just be prepared for the Cough of Doom.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	1	1	The Bluray version of this set is Region B/2 and will not play on US players!! You must buy the (more expensive) DVD set if you want to watch it in Region 1.Regarding the series, it's superb. I ended up watching my newly-purchased DVD version all in one weekend marathon--couldn't stop watching!
A1ASI294P35N3O	0	1	I have read every one of Diane Chamberlain books and she is my favorite author. I have found no other author to compare to her style, and really loved all her previous books (except Brass Ring). This one fell really short for me, it dragged, and was so predictable. I didn't care for the characters, and honesly, I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through the book and just skimmed ahead to the end. Sorry Diane. I will buy your next book....please write in your "old style" - those were absolutely thrilling. Can't wait for the next book.
A1ASI294P35N3O	1	1	Got these cards for my dog loving 12 year old. We love to play cards, and these are just the cutest. Daughter loves them too.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	I shopped around a lot for an adjustable-height folding table before buying this one. I've been very happy with it. It's far lighter than the more common wood+metal tables. It has nice round edges and corners, which makes it safer with kids running around. It seems very resistant to marks or scratches, even with pretty hard use. And the adjustable height works really well (again, in my situation, it's helpful for the kids). I highly recommend this table.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	This is an amazing book. With colorful illustrations, clear explanation, and short but interesting examples, it guides the reader through an introduction to BASIC programming in less than 50 pages. I learned from this book when I was in third grade, before our family even had a computer, just working through the examples on paper. It's that engaging!It's a shame that books like this are not available today; but if you can, get a copy of this book and something like REALbasic, and you or your child will be starting on a good path towards a fascinating hobby.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	I've been reading in all genres, but particularly SF, since I was young, and this is probably the one book that I've gone back to and re-read the most times. It's hard to identify exactly what's so compelling about it -- the characters, the settings, the plot, all work together to make a book that is thoroughly enjoyable. I also like the way it sets up for the others in the series, while standing with full completion on its own (and the others in the series are generally not as good, by the way, though still not bad). If you haven't read this book yet, you're missing out on a true gem.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	This book is amazing. My 6-year-old son loves it, and my wife and I quite enjoy it too. The artwork is beautifully done, colorful, crisp, and bright. The writing is superb too -- perfect rhythm and rhyme, but not forced; I dare say it's better than Dr. Seuss. And the concept of this book really captures the imagination: this amazing car and all that it can do. One thing I especially appreciate about it is that the car does not change from page to page; it's completely self-consistent, even though each page points out some amazing new feature. I also love the front and back inside cover -- they're covered with sketches, in the front showing earlier ideas for the car that didn't make the cut, and in the back, showing the final design, like a rough blueprint.We got this book from the library, but I'll be buying a copy, and looking for other books by the same author. No other children's book has ever impressed me like this one did.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	The Rokenbok system is amazing! The whole family can work together, each controlling a different vehicle or machine (up to 8 at once), to accomplish whatever goals you decide upon -- usually, moving the red and blue "roks" (balls) around. Various starter sets are available, but this is the one we have, and it's a good choice. You get everything you need to set up a small layout, including a front-loader and an automatic ball elevator. All the parts and machines are very well engineered and solid. They're fun and easy to control. As your set grows (and especially as you get more than one controller and vehicle), it's great for multiple kids to play together -- it's non-violent, cooperative, and creative. I highly recommend the Rokenbok line, and this particular set is a great start (and your second set should probably be the Rokenbok RC Monorail).
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	This is a great addition to any Rokenbok layout. It's ideal for the younger Rok workers in the family, because you don't have to steer the monorail -- it just goes forward and back. But it also has a cargo car that you can use to load with balls from the hoppers (included with the starter set) and dump them out again. As always with Rokenbok, the engineering is excellent -- the monorail is solid, easy to control, and has nice features like the cargo tipper automatically recentering itself when you release the dump button. It's also designed so that you can't drive while the tipper is out, so you can't accidentally bash it into things. I also love the way the monorail "rail" isn't composed of special pieces, but is just ordinary Rokenbok beams. That means that in addition to the oval shown on the box, you can no doubt make other layouts using the other parts you already have. (There is also a Monorail Track set with a lot of additional rail parts, including S-shaped pieces that let you make up and down slopes the monorail can climb.) This set is a lot of fun and adds a neat dimension to your layout. I highly recommend it.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	My six-year-old got some money from Grandma for Christmas, and spent it on the RC Power Sweeper. He loves it, and the rest of us have great fun with it too! Finally there's a fun way to pick up all the stray balls that inevitably end up scattered around the play area. The engineering is excellent; the vehicle is strong and the sweeper is effective. When it dumps its balls out the back tipper, some always end up staying in the slanted front portion -- but this is fine, because the sweeper comes with extra balls, so you can just leave that part always loaded, or you can reverse the sweeper to spit them out the front.This vehicle is slightly harder to control than other Rokenbok vehicles we've tried, because it's the first to use all four buttons (for sweeper in/out and tipper up/down). But my son got the hang of it quickly and was soon zipping around the layout, sweeping up balls, and then purposely dumping more out just so he could sweep those up too. I highly recommend this toy.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	1	1	My 6-year-old son brought this book home from his school library. We love it! It's a good story, and a really interesting universe, where the people are robots and their activities are futuristic, but utterly believable. The illustrations are excellent too. It's well written and easy for kids to read. If you can find a copy of this book, get it -- you'll enjoy it.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	0	1	I love the form factor -- it looks great sitting under the Mini -- but in practice it has been mostly just a source of frustration. I have a chain of self-powered Firewire hard drives which simply would not come up when plugged into this hub, but mounted just fine when plugged directly into the Mini. In addition, it does create quite a mess of cables behind the Mini, exposing only one port of each type on front where you really want them. This is a purchase I regret.In fairness, the USB portion of the hub does seem to work a bit better. So if you only need a USB hub, this might be OK, but I wouldn't recommend it for Firewire.
A1ASKNLEFX5XIB	0	1	I disagree with most of the negative reviews here that are focused on the controls -- I found the controls to be easy to learn, and flying the dragon is a lot of fun.What completely ruins this game is the design. The designers appear to be following the rule, "do not ever, EVER allow the player to have more than five seconds of fun." The missions are dull and linear, often being too hard at the end of 5 minutes of boring flying from place to place, and when you fail one you have to sit there for 30 seconds while it reloads and you have to do it all over again. But that's not even the worst part. The worst part is that when you finally do slog through whatever's required of you, and get to a fun part where you're roasting, swiping, and eating enemy soldiers like popcorn and generally having a good time, the level ends! Aaaagh! Who the heck are the game designers to tell me I have to stop having fun and start in on one of their boring missions again?!?I got this game when it first came out, and played through about 10 missions or so before giving up on it. Recently I decided to give it another try, see if perhaps it would download some update that fixed the worst offenses. Nope; it still sucks. Picture any PS3 game that you actually enjoy playing -- InFamous, LEGO Star Wars, Force Unleashed, whatever -- and Lair is pretty much the exact opposite of it. It's very frustrating, because (in my view) the graphics and game mechanics are lovely and innovative. But the game designers should have been fired, and their salaries used to pay for some playtesters, because in terms of actual gameplay Lair is awful. Controlling a fire-breathing, soldier-eating dragon ought to be fun, but these clowns managed to ruin it.
A1AST9IO5GTSJ7	1	1	My son went nuts over this poster. It looks great framed. Well worth the money.
A1AST9IO5GTSJ7	1	1	I bought this for my folks, but I must admit that we all really enjoyed this CD set. Good relaxing music. Also nice to have in the background.
A1AT69HDXNTW1O	0	0	I could kick myself for wasting money on this book! There is precious little information on creating a wardrobe that actually works, but plenty of pictures of the authors and what they think of as brilliant solutions to their so-called figure flaws. There are also lots of "color charts" that really seem to be random squares of color with no direction on how the "charts" can be used. Lots of dubious advice: "black only goes with black." Lots of claims of how they've helped people, but literally no evidence of that, at least in this book. Lots of plugs for products that will probably soon be out of style, off the stores shelves, or nearly impossible to find in the first place.Possibly the worst bit - at least in the eyes of this designer - is that what text there is, is set in extra bold type, in long lines with nearly no space in between the lines. And this text often set in a color that vibrates against the page.But that probably doesn't matter, as most of the text is not worth reading anyway. It's a silly, self-indulgent and vulgar money-grab that ties in with what is, apparently, a mean-spirited, nasty waste of time on television.
A1AT69HDXNTW1O	1	1	My hometown was New Bedford, so of course I was a fan back in the day. (Robert Brown actually did a publicity junket to NB just before the show premiered. Best looking guy who ever set foot in that city, I can tell you!) It's fun to see these again. If you want to be picky, there are plenty of anachronisms and anomolies, but it's more fun to just watch and enjoy. Like many shows of that era, these are little morality plays that actually say more about the times in which they were made than the historical era in which they were set. But I'd watch anything Robert Brown was in, and I anxiously await the second season on DVD.
A1AT69HDXNTW1O	1	1	This is a wonderful spoof of the Gothic novels that were popular at the time. Jane had such a wicked sense of humor! And this is a particularly nice edition of the book - the type is easy on the eyes - not like the tiny type in some versions!
A1AT69HDXNTW1O	1	1	This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best-known Sherlock Holmes mystery and, for many, his very best. what I like best about this new edition is that it is set in modern form: much easier to read than older editions that are set in tiny type with inadequate line spacing! This comfortable-to-read format makes reading The Hound of the Baskervilles an absolute pleasure - no more squinting.
A1ATJ2BADCZZJ9	0	1	A chart Hannity uses in Deliver Us from Evil to explain how Congress, not President Ronald Reagan, ran up the humongous budgetary numbers in the 80s. Franken has enough sense to ask where the chart came from.The answer - from "The Ronald Reagan Homepage," a site not run by financial experts, or even anyone involved in the Reagan administration, just a fan of Ronald Reagan. Not the most reliable and impartial source.For more nonsense and lemming-like partisanship from this meat-head check out this piece of sh*t.
A1ATJ2BADCZZJ9	0	0	This is a scam, they don't actually send you a book, but a bunch of paper that has crap written all over it. If you buy this, I have a bridge to sell you.
A1ATJ2BADCZZJ9	0	0	The blades don't come out. Oh, well they'll come out if you pull with all your might--but then you'll slice your hand open, like I did. Thank goodness for return policies.
A1ATJ2BADCZZJ9	1	1	Awesome value for this chair. It gives a great, deep massage (not like one of those cheap vibrating chairs) and also doubles as a comfy regular chair that reclines electronically! Thank you ijoy!
A1ATY5ESTBK4M7	1	1	In my clinical experience I have used many different types of stethoscopes and the Ad-scope has the best sound quality and versatility of any of them. The only problem I have is that the bell is so heavily made to last that it's not balanced around my neck and tends to hang down and fall off while I'm performing my duties. That being said, I still find the quality of the product to outweigh any of the downfalls it may have. The selection of ear pieces helps me find just the right fit for my needs. I will always pick this brand even above the more expensive litman scopes.
A1AUALT9TWY9IN	0	0	It had a promise there somewhere in the beginning, but then it simply got lost. I don't know how this book appeals to so many people. I guess that the average readers age is around 13, the kind that could get excited over exaggerated violence sadism and sex .Plot: Richard meets Kahlan and they boldly go to save the world from the evil sorcerer and wonder of wonders, they succeed. That about sums it up.Maybe I should mention that on the way Richard is caught by a beautiful cruel but kind hearted torturer lady (I like my SM with high heels and lots of leather, thank you please). This lady has some steamy torture sessions with Richard which last a couple of chapters. These chapters don't seem to have anything to do with advancing the plot. The only reason I can think of that they were added was maybe to advance the book sales. My advice, get an adult book, hire an adult movie, much cheaper and far less a waste of time. The story is linear, full of over stretched scenes (maybe GoodKind had some quota to fill), and is mostly boring.Characters: are all one dimensional and uninspiring. Both heroes Richard and Kahlan portrayed as childish and even stupid. They walk around in a Mr. Goody bear attitude that simply doesn't fit in the entire book. Both never develop an inch through this 836 pages book. This point might be argued since Richard does acquire new skills thought the story. But if I want this kind of development I'll play an AD&D; computer game instead of reading this book (much more entertaining).Story Telling: Have to agree with previous critic. I was lost in a sea of meaningless sentences (again it looks like GoodKind had some quota to fill ).World building: The only point of light. GoodKind had some nice original ideas. Too bad they were misused.To sum it up: This is a bad book, leave it on the bookshelf of the store.
A1AUALT9TWY9IN	1	1	To my opinion plots are overrated. Almost everyone in this genre is stealing from his predecessors. Even the great Tolkien borrowed from the Nordic myths and other sources (anyone who feels offended can ignore the last sentence). But no matter how chewed down or trivial the plot is an adequate author will make the difference. Jack Yeovil scores far above adequate.The story is a gothic mystery / detective style, embedded into the fantasy world of Warhammer. There is a maniac woman-slaughtering beast (jack the ripper style). A noble protecting his brother, an uncorrupted green cop, a psychic and a tough ex-cop trying to bring him to justice. Around them there is a score of minor colorful characters to serve as the prime suspects. Even though we have seen this kind of detective story a thousand times or more (on books and on TV) and even though it is not too tough to figure out the killer, the story still manages to capture the imagination. Jack Yeovil knows how to draw vivid likable characters and how to keep up suspense and intensive rhythm. There was even a nice and an unexpected twist at the end as a bonus.For anyone who is fan of Warhammer this is an excellent buy to your collection
A1AUALT9TWY9IN	0	0	Maybe it's me and I don't fall for this style of short tales, but having read Yeovil's previous Warhammer books I came to expect more. Except for 'Warhawk' (a dirty Harry / Sherlock Holmes style depicting Filthy Harald in another chase after a lunatic murderer), the stories were rather boring. In order for a short story to deliver an impact it must focus on events and include at least one twist or surprise at its end, something to look for. Read O.Henry short stories and you'll see what I mean. When there is no space for character development and lengthy descriptions (IE: in an environment where the author skill cannot be fully utilized) the plot has to count. But 'silver nails' suffers from sad phenomena I've encountered in most Warhammer books; the plot is either an artistic steal or just plain simplistic and bland. No twists, no subplots, no surprise ending. Two heroes set out to stop an assassination and they succeed by staying the hand of the 'would be assassin'. A vampire sets out to kill a band of evil kidnappers, and kills them one by one. Both could have been nice as a complete book but get wasted on a short story. The last Genevieve story was a real disaster. No plot, no climax, no nothing. Yeovil can't decide if he is writing a Warhammer gothic genre or a comical Disc-world chapter. I would advise you Jack (or Kim Newman), leave Pratchett to the Pratchetts.I gave the book two stars because the WarHawk story.
A1AUALT9TWY9IN	0	0	Been ill at bed with high fever for couple of days so I managed finishing Dhampir and its sequel Thief of life.*Let's go through the good points first.*Good Characterization - Both protagonists are rounded, each has its own past (shrouded in a little mystery), they have inner conflict, and share a development of character. This rule goes also for the antagonists, which are also well rounded.*The plot - Is interesting enough, conflict arises and conflict is solved, though nothing unexpected happens as the reader point of view is omnipotent and he learns all the answers well before the protagonist does.*The bad things about Dhampir and TOL lies with the lack of a strong editor.*Repetitiveness - Phrases, sentences and paragraphs are repeated all over again. It looks like the author wasn't sure I was paying attention the first time (I don't like being patronized like that. Who does?). If you read just Dhampir it's annoying, if you read both Dhampir and sequel it's intolerable. Repetitiveness surface also in content. Entire scenes are copied between the books. For instance, the following formula is used at least 10 times between two books. The vampires strike, are wounded by the magical blade and dog, are amazed by the fact that they can bleed and escape with their lives only to try again and again and again. I wonder how does the third book end. Maybe one of the antagonists escapes to plague our heroes in the sequal. Why not? It worked in the first two books. Repetition is bad. You can get away for stealing ideas from other writers; you can't get away from stealing from the previous page.*Too many flashbacks - The first book suffer from too many flashbacks that stop the plot. Some of them or most should have converted to active scenes. I must point that this was remedied in the second book.*Bad choice of point of view - The omnipotent point of view (where we see all characters actions and thoughts), doesn't sit well in a vampire/mystery tale. For my tastes it would have been best to keep the readers in the dark. For example, in one scene we see the vampire laying a magical trap and in the next we see the hero fall into it. Ruins the suspense and surprise, a better scene would have showed us the protagonist triggering the trap.Summery: I'll give the book two and a half stars for entertainment, but for the lack of fractions in the grading system I'll settle for two. I'm sure not going to buy the next vol
A1AUALT9TWY9IN	1	1	This masterpiece has gained almost supernatural halo in Russia.Myth surrounds it like the one claiming the books would not burn if put to flame and rumors that attempts to make this book into into a play always end in disaster.Stalin and friends indeed tried to burn them metaphorically along with the Russian soul. They failed because in people like Bulgakov the flame burned too brightly to be extinguished.Master and Margarita puts Bulgakov in the front line of Russian literature (pretty impressive when you think that beside him you have Dostoyevsky, Chekhov and Tolstoy).It's true, you have to be Homo Sovietic (or preferably a Moscow resident) to understand the depth of the satire and wit poured from the Bulgakov's sharp pen. However, even without a Russian translator attached, this masterpiece is guaranteed to be one of the best books you'll ever read.There are actually three stories here - Satan and retinue of extremely funny subordinates (naked witch and talking cat included), are turned loose in Moscow and tear it upside down. In the background we have the true story (from the viewpoint of an atheist), of the meeting between Pontius Pilate and Jesus of Nazareth. Another story is the love between Margarita and her Master (Artist, writer of the Pilate-Jesus story). The stories intertwine, until finally the Master and Margarita win redemption from the hands of...Satan.The subtitle is a satire of how the totalitarian state treads on the soul of the artist.Events unfold at the speed of light, making this book hard to put down. The dialogs are simply too good to be true. Bulgakov has the sharp eye of Dostoyevsky when it comes to pointing human flaws, and boy oh joy, he can sure kick the human soul and bring all the ugliness to the surface.I can keep attaching superlatives, but none will do justice to this masterpiece, so I'll end with a plea.Please people - Read this book, you'll thank me later.
A1AUBUT82PLMZX	1	1	This book is a must have for anyone seeking Yeshua. I'm not a scholar by any means. I'm just a new babe in Christ looking for true scripture from the Jewish Bible. This Bible has been with me for every Bible Study I have done since I bought it, and I wouldn't give it up for anything. It's a wonderful addition to my other Bible. Make this purchase! You will never regret it!
A1AUBUT82PLMZX	1	1	My sister-in-law is a firefighter and I bought this book for her for part of her Christmas gift. She was touched and loved it very much! It's wonderful, inspiring and emotional for any woman firefighter! Very good little book.
A1AUBUT82PLMZX	1	1	Love this light! The price is fantastic and it looks sooo nice in my bathroom! Thank you!
A1AUDBQZDHUV5C	1	1	I listen to a several audio books a month and have to rate this book probably the best that I have heard or read all year.The book keeps you wanting to keep reading, and the ending is very good too.
A1AUDBQZDHUV5C	0	0	I have been listening to the book and been very disappointed.I am having difficulty getting past the narrator who assigns silly laughable voices to many of the characters.I will definately ensure that I do not listen to anything he reads in future.Now the story itself. I had thought that I was having difficulty following the characters and plot due to the bad reader.However, reading some of the other reviews I have to agree with most of them.The story is fragmented, has too many characters to follow and there are many instances that are laughably unbelievable.I will be careful in future when picking a Cussler book with a co-auther

A1AUP5B5J0BPJ0	1	1	This is one of my puppy's favorites toys.it keeps her busy and she can entertain herself or I will use the squirrels to play fetch.I love highly recommend this toy.Update: after 5 months - this is still one of my king charles spaniel's favorite toys.

A1AUQLD2YNJDOY	1	1	this album is awesome!!!!. however it is more professional sounding than say red rocks, which has that raw sound that is so great. album starts off nice with pnp>rapunzel. jam at the end is terrific. great way to start out. rhyme and reason and the stone are both excellent versions. pretty standard however. #41 is one of the major highlights of the album. dave's voice sounds so awesome and the jam at the end is incredible. crash is same as always complete with the dixie chicken lines. jimi thing is yet another highlight. this version is one of the best that ive heard. god do they jam on this too. #36 is decent. not nearly as good as red rocks but not terrible either. dave's scat singing is better hear however. warehouse is also just a standard version. it keeps that power that it always has and a nice way to close out the first disc. too much definitely gets the crowd into the show. (as you can also tell in the video of the concert) and as a concert usual it drops the "f bomb" at the end many times. god bless it. true reflections, two step, granny and stay are all pretty standard versions each one being great. not a whole lot needs to be said. #40 is definitely a rare treat for the cd. even though it is only a verse or 2 long it is still awesome and dave is awesome solo. long black veil is my least fav. on the album. it seems to be too drawn out which is almost impossible for dmb to do. the ladies on this get to me after a while at the end. the beginning however is awesome, with great lyrics. dont drink the water is standard and very powerful as it always is. stefan does his 2 minute bass solo and then watchtower is played. definitely another hightlight of the album. killer version and boyd and leroi are definitely on. a must have album
A1AUQLD2YNJDOY	1	1	this album is incredible! i saw nickelback in concert without owning any of their cd's. my friend gave me a free ticket so i went with him. i didnt know any songs, except of course the 2 radio songs (how you remind me and too bad). the concert was incredible. a few months after the concert i was able to finally get silver side up. when i put it in i listened to it all the way through and it has not left my car since. so much powerful rock on this album and the lyrics are terrific. the highlights are never again, hollywood, and where do i hide. the 2 radio songs were overplayed but are definitely one of the reasons the album is so great. i recommend getting this album. you will not be dissapointed!!!
A1AUQLD2YNJDOY	0	0	besides Frantic, and St. Anger (the only 2 I can stand on this CD), this album is full of garbage. Which actually sounds like what Lars is banging on...metal trash cans. kirk is NOWHERE to be found...and I mean NOWHERE, and neither is robert. sounds like lars banging trash cans, while james screams at the top of his lungs and occasionally plays the guitar. at least they still kick ass live, mainly because they only play a couple of the songs from this album.
A1AV84LKHGH4FS	1	1	This is exactly what I wanted. These shorts are the 7" long ones and they feel great. I work out great in them and are very complimentary to a woman's body. I'd buy them again
A1AV84LKHGH4FS	1	1	These are a great product and the price made them even better!~When lacing them into your shoes, the directions say to clip the ends so that they are the length that you need them to be. My only problem with this is that I would like to take them out and put them in multiple times so don't cut them if you'd like to do the same. The end of them have the plastic which makes lacing easier, however if you cut it then its hard to lace them.Definitely recommend these.
A1AVCMXG1MEYF2	1	1	Yes it's noisy, yes it's hard to get through all in one sitting. But ignore all reviews that say this is just undifferentiated scree with no variation. There's actually a hell of a lot going on here if you listen closely; there's another Merzbow release called "Rainbow Electronics" and the title would suit this one as well. Complex, shifting patterns of sound, always changing, always "musical" in the sense that there's a method to the madness; you can hear solos, beats, themes & variations, the lot. As background music it's atrocious, unless you're using it as background to cutting sheet metal with an angle grinder, but it rewards close listening. How long you can endure is another matter - but this is classic Merzbow, and it's got a great cover to boot.
A1AVCMXG1MEYF2	1	1	This is the last great Frank Black album. Tight, loud and recorded live to 2-track. A Sunday-afternoon-garage-jam feel is provided by the slightly awkward mix (Frank's voice too loud) and the tendency of guitarist Lyle Workman to lapse into wanky solo cliches that almost ruin a couple of tracks. But unlike any Sunday afternoon jam I've ever been involved in, the songs are great and the band is on stunning, lethal form. Frank has to be one of THE killer rhythm guitarists, nobody nails a song to the floor like the fat man can. His voice isn't as good as it used to be, not every song is a gem, and there's an anguished lyrical obsession with Christian faith that this particular Satan worshipper finds a bit of a turn-off (one song is a cover of tragic gospel "rocker" Larry Norman - I preferred it when he sang about sex 'n' spaceships), but overall it rocks like a (...), and you won't find a better slice of post-Pixies Frank.
A1AVCO0MBVM6PJ	0	0	Picked this up because the title caught my eye. Although it was somewhat entertaining and certainly a quick read, I find it hard to recommend this book. The character development is poor and left me wondering why in the world someone like Lonnie Blake would ever be interested in a Carol Dodson. Or why a man who has just taken over the American branch of a &quot;killer for hire&quot; corporation would become so obsessed with Dodson. Or why it's necessary to kill everyone in the path of finding Carol, as if this wouldn't attract some sort of attention.Combine that with the &quot;made for TV movie&quot; style writing and you get a book that wasn't as satisfying at all. At one point he describes a background character as a &quot;doofus&quot; and I began to wonder how old the person who wrote this was. All in all, the book seemed rushed to publication, as if the author had no time to think and write the story out the way he wanted.Sorry Mr Klavan, but this one needed a lot of work.
A1AVCO0MBVM6PJ	1	1	Being a big Seinfeld fan, I knew once I saw this book I had to have it.The back cover carried many quotes, the first being, &quot;As my boat sank into the Zambezi I watched my luggage float downstream over Victoria Falls. But the day wasn't a total loss...&quot; If there was ever a question that I'd actually get the book, those two lines convinced me to pick it up.After reading it, I feel as though I've sat down with John Peterman himself and listened to his triumphs as well as his failures. Feel like I've had a beer with the man as he described some of his most memorable trips as well as the beginning and end of his catalog and outlet business. Listened to him tell about the many people he's met through his adventures, including the man that would play him on TV.If you're a Seinfeld fan, pick this book up and read about the actual J. Peterman. If you're starting your own business, pick up this book for inspiration (and maybe for some of the things you should avoid in business). Lastly, if you're looking for something with a light-hearted approach to life, PICK UP THIS BOOK!!
A1AVCO0MBVM6PJ	1	1	Well, John Connolly has done it again. Slightly less complicated than his initial offering, this book is no by no means less entertaining. It opens, alternating between a shootout in an ocean front parking lot in Maine and an old woman escaping from a home for the elderly. Thus, a chain of events have been kicked off drawing in the Mob, a trouble maker deliquent on his child support, a pair of killer elites and a phantom serial killer who claims the woods of Maine as his home. And who, of course, could better sort everything out than Bird Parker and his infamous partners Angel and Louis.This book was a page turner. Dark and descriptive with some excellent side characters. John Connolly is truly a master story teller and what a story he has to tell here. Hope you all enjoy this book as much as me.
A1AVCO0MBVM6PJ	0	1	I was looking forward to a good old fashioned adventure/mystery. What I wound up with was an overdramatic Lifetime movie with a whole lot of unnecessary filler. When it wasn't being dramatic it was predictable and a shade ridiculous. I did enjoy the overall story that put Ryan Elder in search of the something in the present to understand his past. The mysterious Department 30 was a great touch which I think should have been explored a little further. If you're looking for a quick summer read then this is your book.
A1AVD4HBP056KV	0	1	On &quot;Ram It Down,&quot; Priest is no longer taking their audience seriously, or insulting their intelligence, you decide. Especially Halford, I mean, just look at the dreck that passes for lyrics... it seems that these were written as part of not-so-creative writing exercise by a fifth grader. All bashing aside, the record does, for the most part, rock. Not exactly the creative or sharp lead breaks that were in evidence throughout &quot;Screaming&quot; or &quot;Defenders&quot; though. &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; is a standout mainly for its shredding guitar intro - vintage '80s excess. &quot;Come and Get It&quot; is all too typical Priest, and so anonymous you forget what album it came from after a while. &quot;Blood Red Skies&quot; is a cool atmospheric ballad with a techno heavy drum beat. Including a metal cover of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is a low point, although it doesn't suck, it does demonstrate a lack of inspirational imput. And like another review mentioned, &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; is a rehash of &quot;Heavy Duty/Defender of the Faith.&quot; Ultimately, &quot;Ram It Down&quot; is total kiddy metal, a pandering over-produced record designed to ride the coattails of a once roiling metal dynasty. Thank you for getting rid of Tom Allom by the time &quot;Painkiller&quot; rolled around.
A1AVDXYCRXSBLX	1	1	THE ONLY THING THAT SLOWED THIS MODERN MASTERPIECE DOWN FROM BECOMING A CLASSIC. WAS THE USE OF THE LOVE TRIANGLE IT WORKED BUT.... IT JUST SLOWED THE STORY DOWN, WHEN EVER THE ATTACK DOES HAPPEN THE LOVE TRIANGLE JUST GOES TO THE BACKGROUND. AND THE ACTION STARTS HAPPENING, IN ONE OF THE MOST GRAND AND AWSEOME DISPLAYS OF MOVIE MAKING OF ALL TIME. AND I THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO LOVES DVD'S WILL LIKE THIS ONE, THE TRANSFER LOOKS GREAT AND HAS NO VISIBLE GRAIN THAT I COULD SEE, AUDIO IS THE GREASTEST I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE WEAK IN THE CENTER CHANNEL, BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. SO WHEN EVER YOU SEE THIS MOVIE OUT IN THE STORES OR ONLINE. BUY IT ,BUY IT ,BUY IT, BUY IT!
A1AVDXYCRXSBLX	1	1	THIS IS THE GREATEST TELLING OF THIS STORY EVER. I THINK THAT IT IS THE MOST EVIL AND HAUNTING MOVIE. ALL IN THE BEST WAY OF COURSE, IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST VERSION ON DISC THE SUBERBIT VERSION IS HEAD&amp;SHOULDERS ABOVE THE FIRST DISC.PICTURE/SUPER/AUDIO/SUPER. GO OUT AND BUY THIS DISC WHEN IT COMES OUT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
A1AVI5613UKY50	0	0	That was 3 hours that seemed like a year. Too many pointless and seemingly endless fight scenes and not enough story.
A1AVI5613UKY50	0	0	I bought this to use for my dry erase white board. It was too flimsy to hold my fairly light board.This easel requires assembly.
A1AVI5613UKY50	0	1	Maybe I didn't give it long enough. Admittedly, I've watched only five episodes of the first season, but while watching I can't resist the impulse to go do something else. The show just does not hold my interest. The characters are likable, but not in a way that makes me care what they do next.
A1AVSMM4UINCEG	0	0	Unfortunately this item did not work. They sent us a replacement and it ALSO didn't work. The good news is that they are sending us a THIRD replacement and we're crossing fingers that the 3rd time is a charm.
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	1	0	I've had these for about 15 years now and use them for my own haircuts. I love them! They stay sharp for a very, very long time and give me the edge I want. I have had them professionally sharpened about twice since I've owned them. The blades still meet precisely (some scissors warp, or the screws loosen, etc. causing the blades to "come apart"). They are still like new, but I'm putting them on my wish list in case I ever need to find them to buy them again!By the way, I would never use these for giving a child a haircut--or perhaps anyone else. They are EXTREMELY sharp, and yes, razor-edged. I know it's not recommended to cut your own hair, but hey, it's my hair. Just as a review for the scissors, I really like them. I'm sure they'd be great for quilting, too. :-)
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	0	0	I am a devout Christian and was looking forward to an inspirational movie, but this misses the mark. After waiting 40 years for the right man, the main character settles for a married drug dealer who puts his wife in a home and divorces her to marry the main character. To me that isn't a good Christian story. Also, the acting is terrible!!! Oh, and the main character wears VERY tight revealing outfits which in my book were not good choices for a Christian.
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	1	1	I bought this to have an "emergency travel kit"; I liked that it was see-through so I could pack far in advance and not have to unpack to see what was in it. Also great for keeping in the car; again, I like that it's see through because I wanted to have it for certain occasions only, and to keep it prepacked, and I didn't want to forget what was in it. It's very sturdy!! I was surprised at the thickness of the vinyl. If necessary, for privacy concerns, it would be easy to put a scarf or similar item against the inside vinyl; you could also personalize your backpack that way, like a skin! I am strongly considering buying another. I know these are mostly for kids at school but I am in my 40s!
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	1	1	I agree that I've heard parts of things in this video but never coherently connected. I'm not sure what to think about it, but it definitely makes you think! It's different from most of the other similar types of videos out there.
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	1	0	This guy's performance is simply amazing! You have to see it. I agree that the plain set with Max in his jeans, no bells and whistles, is very refreshing. The gospel needs no more. The translation used is NIV--not my favorite, but that's ok. I have actually come back to see if I can purchase this on DVD.
A1AW1YRASFZSJS	0	0	The item description says this should contain four pieces, but I received ONE tiny .53 ounce piece of chocolate in a big box! I should have read the description better because I thought this was for the large bars, not the little pieces (my mistake). I wouldn't have paid this price--I could have bought a whole bag at BJs for what I paid for the one piece plus shipping. I have contacted the seller regarding only receiving one, not four pieces, and will revise this if I receive the rest.
A1AW35YVQ61AA3	1	1	It's very seldom that a film truly deserves a perfect FIVE star rating; well, at least a film from the past ten years or so. You know that old saying: they don't make 'em like they used to anymore? That's true, except for Girl on the Bridge. This film is simply put: wistful. It sparkles with a peculiar romantic intensity and a vividness that is not often found in contemporary films; whatever the language. It's as if Cukor or Hawks or Capra stepped out of the past to guide this little film along. It would take the French to make a movie this glowing with romantic saturation. The director is Patrice Leconte. That name will probably not mean much to most people outside of France or Europe, but in his native country he is as famous and respected a living filmmaker as there ever was. When you look at the body of Leconte's work it may not seem impressive at first. He doesn't have a mile long list of blockbuster hits to his name (like Scorsese or Spielberg) but he makes the most of every single film he creates and when viewed as a whole, his films mostly share a similar thread: two lonely and desperate people trying to make a connection in a cruel world.In some of Leconte's films the connection is as simple as friendship (The Man on the Train '02, My Best Friend '06) but mostly his films revolve around the eminent concept of love (Girl on the Bridge '99, The Widow of Saint-Pierre '00) and to some degree obsession (Monsieur Hire '89, The Hairdresser's Husband '90, Intimate Strangers '04). But do not mistake me, Girl on the Bridge is not some weepy romantic tear-jerker. On the contrary, it is something of an anomaly. It is about two damaged people who share a bond that neither one can quite understand or ultimately ignore. How you feel about that bond in question is up to you since some may say it's luck, and others might say it's clairvoyance. Yes. There is an air of mysticism to the proceedings in Girl on the Bridge, but believe me, in terms of the story it's what makes the whole thing click. That and the chemistry of the two stars: Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis (better known as the future Mrs. Johnny Depp).Auteuil dominates the film with his world-weary eyes and saggy face. There is something brutal about him that lingers caged under a gentle surface; he's like a Gallic Bogart with more spontaneity. In this film he plays a professional knife thrower. When one considers the type of person it must take to have knives thrown at them at high velocity, it's no wonder he finds his would-be assistants on the ledges of Parisian bridges after nightfall. This particular would-be target is played by the delicate, sensual and callow Paradis. Their stormy professional relationship (replete with psychic bond) soon matures into a true friendship and eventual...well, I'll leave the rest up to you to discover. The film is filled with playful yet ravishing cinematography (courtesy of Jean-Marie Dreujou) and a haunting musical score (featuring the unforgettable Marianne Faithfull). It's funny, erotic and above all else a film that fills the senses and leaves you breathless. Legend Films presents Girl on the Bridge in a sparkling anamorphic transfer with pleasing sound. This is the first time the film has been released on DVD in region 1, and believe me, it was long overdue. I showed this film to someone once and all they could say afterward was: "it looked like one of those black and white cologne or diamond commercials on TV." Yeah, I suppose there are some people who could look at Michelangelo's ceiling in the Sistine Chapel and sum it up by saying: "it sure went high up." It's so easy for some to miss the point. I think what Leconte is trying to say with most of his films is that love is inherently simple, yet we as human beings complicate the matter every time. Perhaps it's something in our nature. Is it the heart that's responsible? The head? The gut? Maybe it's the whole damn thing...
A1AW35YVQ61AA3	1	1	Finally, it seems shelling out nearly thirty bucks for Sweeney Todd on blu-ray is worth it...now you get the Sleepy Hollow blu-ray for practically nothing. Actually, since this 2-pack became available the price of the Sweeney Todd blu-ray by itself has dropped about five bucks but really you are paying [..] a piece to own Sweeney and Sleepy together...Now for the good stuff. If you didn't already know, Sweeney Todd on blu-ray looks magnificent. I thought the standard def DVD was beautiful but the blu-ray trumps it in almost every respect. The soundtrack (which is the true star of the film) is about as perfect as one could expect. This film seems to be "love it" or "hate it" with most people so if you find you are kinda in the middle you will definitely benefit from seeing it in full 1080p glory. Burton may have arguably made some better films (Ed Wood for one) but this one is right up there in the upper echelon of musical theatre and gothic horror, even if some of it may feel a little too conjoined at times.Sleepy Hollow on the other hand is a different story. The film itself is the perfect late-night horror feature. Depp plays Ichabod Crane as sort of a fey Peter Cushing in Burton's puritan nightmare. The sets (this film won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction -- as did Sweeney Todd) and the costumes are breathtaking but fail to truly come alive in Paramount's lackluster hi-def transfer. Much has been debated about "filmic" quality recently and while grain is certainly inherent to film (this picture will not look the same as Pirates of the Caribbean) the transfer here left a lot to be desired. Only a small step up from the standard def DVD, the blu-ray may disappoint some who have come to expect more clarity and detail from even older films on this new format.If you are a Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fan (in addition to Hammer Horror), this 2-pack of essential Burton/Depp films should be a no-brainer. If you purchased Sweeney Todd on DVD before the blu-ray came out you will not find the rebate offer with this package; it is only available for a limited time on the individual Sweeney Todd blu-ray disc. The two discs repackaged here are exactly the same as the individual ones (minus the mail-in rebate on Sweeney) and offer up a mixed bag of sadistic singing barbers, cowardly constables, murderous meat pies and headless Hessians...sure to thrill & delight apparitions of all ages!
A1AW35YVQ61AA3	0	1	This is a review of the movie -- not the Blu-ray -- and it does contain spoilers...It seems that a lot of the five star reviews I've read here all seem to admit the film had little or no character development. How can you say a film is "five stars" that has no character development? It's true by the way. Public Enemies had little to no character development. That's fine if you're making a movie about Elvis or Santa Claus. The audience already has some idea who these characters are in their own minds. When you're dealing with men like John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis things tend to get a little more vague for some folks.I saw Public Enemies in the theater. Loved the book by Bryan Burrough. I've also been a life-long Dillinger fan. Originally I had no desire to see this film half-expecting it to be bad. My curiosity eventually got the better of me. Where Johnny Depp soared in his larger than life take on guys like Ed Wood, George Jung and Hunter S. Thompson he went down like a lead balloon as Dillinger. John Herbert Dillinger was one of the most charismatic and charming criminals the world has ever known. Why then would Johnny Depp play him so tight-lipped? If you agree that Depp was tight-lipped in this film, Christian Bale as Purvis would have had no lips at all by comparison.In short, this was not the same Dillinger and Purvis that really lived. Okay, I know. Stop right there. It's only a movie. But wait just a minute -- this was a movie based on a beautifully written and meticulously researched piece of nonfiction. So why then does Dillinger appear in the beginning of the film at the infamous Walter Dietrich Indiana State Penitentiary breakout of 1933 when he was serving time himself in Lima, Ohio? Sure, Dillinger helped plan the ten-man escape but he did it from inside a prison cell. Surely writer/director Michael Mann read the book he based his film on. Didn't he?Why did Mann have to invent a scene like something out of Heat in which Dillinger (caged in a big cell &agrave; la Hannibal Lecter) has an actual confrontation with the man employed to catch him? Surely Dillinger and Purvis must have met like this in real-life? It had to be in the book too, right? Wrong. Dillinger was incarcerated in Crown Point, Indiana but he never met Purvis face-to-face. Ever. This was just pure made-up nonsense. Kind of like Purvis requesting outside help from experienced law enforcement professionals to combat the gangsters who were mowing-down his young white-collar agents with relative ease. In reality, it was Hoover (Purvis' boss) who brought in Charles Winstead and the other cowboy cops from Texas and Oklahoma because he thought Purvis was grossly incompetent. Turns out, Hoover was right. Purvis was a colossal failure. Hoover actually had him demoted. In fact, Purvis wasn't even in charge of the Dillinger investigation (Samuel Cowley was) in the final weeks leading up to Dillinger's eventual death. But he's still in charge in this movie. In fact, he's kind of portrayed as something of a reluctant hero; a taciturn stoic agent of the law. Sure he was.Then we come to Little Bohemia in April 1934. Aside from using the real Northern Wisconsin location in the film, this entire portion of the story is pure fantasy. This is what we know happened: Purvis failed yet again to nab Dillinger but he did manage to kill an innocent bystander and wound two others in the process. This is what is shown in the movie: Purvis guns down Baby Face Nelson in the woods outside the lodge. Shenanigans. Nelson wasn't even shot there. He outlived Dillinger. As did half of the gang members that Mann kills off during his film (including Stephen Dorff as Homer Van Meter). I suppose this was done in an effort to make Dillinger look like the last of the gang and all that. I get it. Shenanigans.Where in the film was Dillinger's well-known plastic surgery? Why they would choose to leave this critical bit of business out is beyond me. Instead, Mann has Dillinger walk undetected into the very office in downtown Chicago that has been created to catch him. He looks at photos on the wall of his old gang with the word "DECEASED" printed underneath them (even though most of them weren't dead yet in real-life) then he even stops and has a brief chat with some of the Agents who are listening to a ball game on a radio. Talk amongst yourselves on that one.Don't even get me started on Billie Frechette, Dillinger's long-time sweetheart. Dillinger had A LOT of girlfriends in his day but this movie chooses to focus solely on this relationship. Okay. I'll buy it. But did we really need the standard issue, contrived, Hollywood love story in a shoot-em-up John Dillinger movie? It's all for dramatic effect I would presume. Mann also leaves out the fact that Billie spent the rest of her life capitalizing off her association with Dillinger and touring in a theatrical show with members of Dillinger's own family. She died of cancer in 1969. Juliet Capulet she was not.After the Little Bohemia incident, the film dumps us right into the final hours. The place is the Biograph theater at 2433-43 North Lincoln Avenue in Chicago -- the scene of John Dillinger's death. If you want the real details of the incident, you should read the book Public Enemies or any of the other half-dozen or so books still in print about the life of John Dillinger. They are far more interesting and exciting than this film is. All you need to know is: Dillinger was betrayed by a woman, a madame named Ana Cumpanas (aka Anna Sage) who was in fear of being deported to Romania and cut a deal with Purvis to bring in Dillinger. A deal that Purvis later reneged on.Special Agent Charles Winstead was the man who was later credited with getting the Dillinger killshot. He is played quite effectively by the underrated Stephen Lang. He and Mann worked together before on Manhunter. Back when Mann used to make good movies. In reality, Winstead went to the Marbro Theater first unlike his showy scene in the film. When determining which of the two suspected theaters Dillinger will be at, Winstead asks which movie is playing at both. He is told a Shirley Temple film and a Clark Gable gangster picture. He replies: "John Dillinger will not be seeing a Shirley Temple movie" or something to that effect. It was a cute line nonetheless.The final scene plays out pretty much as I expected. Except for it being about 97% inaccurate. In reality, Purvis was sweating and shaking the whole time unlike Bale in the film who is never less than calm, cool and collected. There was a moment or two of chaos as the crowd emerged from the theater and some of the G-Men were fighting with the local cops and the theater manager (not in the movie) until finally Dillinger emerges with a girl on each arm. Despite a completely ridiculous camera shot of an overzealous (and near-retarded) Agent drawing his gun on the street about ten yards away from behind Dillinger (why weren't there any people screaming at the sight of this?) and then practically running toward him, they somehow managed to capture the actual moment of Dillinger's death PERFECTLY. It's by far the most accurate thing in the movie. Since the rest of the movie lumbers along like an old Chevy with four flat tires I can't help thinking this scene was gotten right by accident.Was the film entertaining? Not nearly as enjoyable as The Untouchables was. At least The Untouchables didn't pretend to be historical drama and it wasn't based on a highly lauded work of nonfiction. The Untouchables was intended to be a Hollywood historical fantasy and it's certainly one of the most entertaining movies of it's kind. It's a modern gangster melodrama. Public Enemies isn't any of these things. To be honest, I don't know what it is.Put simply: to me, the film has no soul. It is bland and predictable. The action is cluttered, the modern music throws it off and the performances fail to ignite any real depth or emotion. Worse yet, it's as if it were shooting for some level of drab realism yet it fell back on glossy convention every opportunity it had. I had a real hard time trying not to laugh during that cornball ending too with Frechette and Winstead. This film fails to even crack the surface of who John Dillinger was as a man. Dillinger was a charming, cold-blooded killer. He was without a doubt the most notorious and celebrated bank-robber this Country has ever seen. One of the biggest problems with this film for me was Mann hardly showed Dillinger robbing any banks at all. There's no real sense of time in the film or when things are actually happening. In the movie, John Dillinger tells us that he's a bank robber. There's the rub. Don't tell us, Johnny. Show us.
A1AW35YVQ61AA3	0	1	My favorite Scorsese films (Mean Streets; Taxi Driver; The King of Comedy; Goodfellas) have always felt 'non-Hollywood' to me; my least favorite (Gangs of New York; The Aviator; The Departed; Shutter Island) seem to be the most conventional and reliant on Hollywood formula. Not all formulaic films are bad. The King's Speech is one of the most typical Hollywood films to come along in years and it's still a pleasure to watch (though a bit sappy).No films are perfect, unless they are perfectly bad. Of course, there is something joyful about watching a perfectly bad film (Plan 9 from Outer Space; Attack of the 50 Foot Woman). When a film tries it's hardest to do more and fails considerably, it can become aggravating. Scorsese's Hugo is not technically a bad film. On the other hand, it's not a good one either. It falls short on so many levels it's hard to even give it a fair estimation without sounding like a cynic. For starters: it's clumsy. It's filled with more CGI than an average live-action outing and if it weren't for the human actors who populate it, I would say it felt almost totally animated along The Polar Express lines. For a kids film, there is little or no sense of wonder or adventure in it. Hugo gets chased by an orphan-obsessed station inspector (with a leg that symbolically reminded me of von Rauffenstein's neck brace in Grand Illusion) and that's about it. There are many symbolic references (intentional or otherwise) in Hugo. So much so, I began to wonder what was actually original about the film. I also began to wonder exactly how and why Scorsese sold out yet again to the establishment.A rough, challenging film like Taxi Driver or a sweet, introspective one like Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore aren't going to do well at the cineplex -- unless they are made by Martin Scorsese. There's the rub. Scorsese has a built-in audience (and critics cheering squad) regardless of what he does. He's also spent the better part of the last two decades making conventional, indirect films that seem like they could have been directed by, well...anyone. When he made Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, it stuck out as an anomaly in his early career because it had a central female protagonist. Hugo is another anomaly, simply because it's a kids film. The big difference between the two movies is Alice seemed to defy convention and refused to be a weepy women's issue picture. Hugo on the other hand strives to be a personal story of abandonment and redemption as well as grand historical fantasy. While it flirts relentlessly with these ambitions, it never really grabs on to any of them. It never really picks up enough steam. Worse yet, the film contains several moments that even an amateur film-maker might have rethought or simply avoided. There is a scene in which Chlo Grace Moretz gets knocked down in the train station and is almost trampled by a hoard of passengers. The problem occurs when her perspective changes to a bizarre camera angle looking directly up toward the ceiling as the shoes of the mob seemingly walk flatly over a sheet of glass on top of her. My only guess is this looked way less-effective in the 2D version I was watching than it did in the 3D manner for which it was shot. The argument for selling out or not seems to end right there. There were obvious '3D moments' in the far superior Tin Tin but they never distracted from that films story.There is a lot of talk about movies in Hugo. So much so that I began to forget about the titular protagonist altogether. Scorsese injects the film with a kind of remedial silent film history that can only be meant to enthrall an adult audience with the vaguest of notions regarding these staples of TCM and film class syllabi. I don't need a full-blown documentary on the subject (though it is one of the few things Scorsese actually seems to be artistically successful at these days, especially with his George Harrison: Living in the Material World) but I kept wondering: what does this much film history have to do with Hugo's story? Hugo is not the main character of this film like he is in the source book. That's fine, but changing horses like that midstream, from orphaned boy on a quest to bitter old reclusive film-maker (Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s) feeling unloved or jilted was more jarring than the conflicting CGI environments -- especially when Hugo does very little other than going through motions to inadvertently help the old filmmaker. The film struggles to find it's center and leans too heavily toward the cause of film preservation than it should. By the end, we are beat over our heads to death with it.The truth is, I still don't know if Scorsese has become a total sell-out. I'm also not going to begin telling you how Hugo could (or should) have been a better film. I will say that had they stuck to the tone of the book (even just in spirit) it might have been a more satisfying experience. Also, there's a little gimmick used in Hugo that I picked up on after seeing a Woody Allen film once -- if a character in a film says something like: "Happy endings only happen in the movies" -- you can best be sure that the film you are watching is going to contain one of those same patented happy endings. If anything, Hugo's greatest contribution would seem it's an excellent primer on the well-known and highly regarded work of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. This film really only acts as a reminder that not all artists are as consistently and vigorously celebrated as Scorsese in their own day. I doubt that I will think too much about Hugo in the future. It's already sort of subsided into that 'curious failures' trunk in my mind. Like the unnatural-looking and awkwardly conceived CGI train-wreck that occurs in Hugo's dream -- Scorsese continues his streak of pure Hollywood hokum. As long as he keeps waving his baton to the masses, the longer his orchestra will seem out of tune.
A1AWDFOVEH6U3E	1	1	I would love to read a story written from Charlotte's point of view. Sure, Darkest Hour was prteey good, but it does not explain why Charlotte was afraid of Lillian. Maybe the Cutler series needs her to tell her story, about how Emily treated her.
A1AWDFOVEH6U3E	0	0	this book is typical of mr niederman's &#34;vc andrews&#34; books. full of whiny brats and lame villians. honestly, even the butler in fita was more evil than the halfbrothers. in response to casey snydets statement &#34;what 16 year old calld her mother mommy&#34; answer :ALL VC ANDREWS CHARACTERS!!!!!! seriously i stopped calling mine that when i was five. oh and mr neiderman please stop referring the male sex organ as &#34;hardness&#34; or &#34;manliness&#34; it sounds so...stupid. and please stop having the characters go into detail about their periods and the proper way to insert a tampon. a real woman knows sbout this and does not go out of het way to mention it. whats next - a character who vividly describes her bowel movements?
A1AWDFOVEH6U3E	0	1	yes i realize it is hard to put so much material into a single movie. this must be why so many great characters were ... deleted? but how can m. night NOT include certain material from the episode called "the deserter" fans know whihch one i mean. seriously katar learning how to heal while waterbending is a very key element. how exactly would m. night explain katara healing aang - that ANG not ONG - at the end of book two? no wonder this movie "won" worst movie of the year. even the expendables was better, and that was crap... so what does that mean this movie is?
A1AWFP630U4M2S	1	1	When I was in fifth grade, I reluctantly picked up this book at a friend's insistence. When I began,I was almost immediatly [drawn] into Eddings' magnificent world. This series really got me interested in Fantasy books, and I'm eternally gratefull to this author for showing me all the genre has to offer.Today, I still pick up Pawn of Prophecy and vist Garion's world once again.I'D SAVE THIS BOOK AND THE REST OF THIS SERIES FROM A BURNING BUILDING!I recomend this book to anybody who wants to see Fantasy writting at it's best.
A1AWFP630U4M2S	0	0	When I discovered my favorite fantasy author (Three guesses as to who that is..) was publishing a new series, I was elated. However, once I was 20 pages into the first novel, that excitement was promptly quelled. There wasn't a single drop of that magic that was present in his previous works.All of the characters in &lt;i>The Elder Gods&lt;/i> are flat and one-dimnsional. Furthermore, said characters are practically recycled from Eddings' other series! Zelana is suspisicously similar to Polgara, Longbow to Durnik, Eleria to Ce'Nedra, and Rabbit to Silk. This isn't the first time Eddings has tried to 'pull one over' on his readers. He commits a similar set of vile crimes in &lt;i>The Redemption of Althalus&lt;/i>, though TRoA is a far better read than his latest release.A majority of this book is spent preparing for battle. Not a single shred of excitement can be found witin &lt;i>The Elder Gods&lt;/i>; Even the climax is rather dull and drab. I could barely bring myself to finish this book.Without Eddings' trademark brand of humour, endearing and sarcastic characters, and intriguing plot, this book is nothing bu a simple children's book.Eddings fans will be crushed.
A1AWP3Q7MNQQXL	1	1	LOVE the colors of this set, which I've been advised is discontinued through the company's outlet stores.Be warned however that the bread/butter plate is SMALLER than what I expected. They are about 6 3/4" across compared with the plates that I thought they would came (those measured a little over 8 1/2").Still this is a great, fun set to use to mix/match colors and patterns. I am mixing with (discontinued) citrus (yellow bands), memphis (although the colors in Memphis are not as bright as these) and urban red.
A1AWP3Q7MNQQXL	0	1	I rarely write on Amazon about anything but this vacuum made me change my mind. I purchased mine at a national chain after reading the only review I could find on the web - the one I saw at Amazon.I *love* Bissell and got a bagless vacuum a few years ago that has been going strong but when a 30% coupon arrived I just could resist and went out to buy this vacuum.It is very, very quiet. It did pick up a lot that my older Bissell apparantley has been missing.But:The handle is very heavy compared to my other Bissell and it was tiring to push the vacuum on wood floors and very thin-pile carpet.The collection cup is much messier and more difficult to empty than my old Bissell. It was not hands free at all. The old cup was a quick wrist-flip to dump out. This one requires pushing a button that opens the bottom of the filter - only the button on my vacuum stuck and I had to pull it with my hands. Yuch!The kicker was when I vacuumed my steps. The long reach cord is the same on all Bissell - don't think this is so much longer than the other vacuums. I vacuumed my stairs, leaving the cleaner at the top. It toppled over and all the way down when I was on step #4. Maybe I should have put the vacuum at the bottom but with my old Bissell that wasn't necessary.Did I mention the on/off switch is near the top of the handle? It is also very sensitive and the slightest touch will turn the vacuum off/on. Annoying!The tumbling episode and the heavy handle convinced me to return this while I had time. It looks like a Dyson and vacuums very well. But the negatives totally outweighed any positives.
A1AWP3Q7MNQQXL	1	1	I stumbled across these bars at an industry trade show and brought home the Cookies and Cream flavor for my picky 10 year old son . Out of the hundreds of sample bars I brought home he picked this one and tried it without me even knowing. Maybe the cheetah on the front? Anyway, He loved it and it has become his favorite nutrition bar! (His old favorite nutrition bar was Balance Bar's Cookie Dough.)He still loves these bars best even though he tried the two other flavors. I just put them on subscription so I'll have plenty in the house for him and the hockey team.
A1AWPWLHSF2UPC	0	0	I got this thing after the original from Garmin broke after two years. This one looks just like the original, but it's cheap Chinese junk made from substandard materials. It lasted less than two months, then the rubber suction cup ripped where it attaches to the mount.Save yourself the headache. Order the real one from Garmin.
A1AWPWLHSF2UPC	1	1	Wood is the best material to make a lemon reamer out of. I've tried all kinds of others. Plastic and stainless steel are too slippery and don't bite into the fruit pulp. Wooden ones get out just about every last drop, and since the fruits are acidic, they're naturally anti-microbial. As long as you rinse and leave out to air dry, you'll never have to worry about any kind of microbial contamination in the wood.I cook often; lemon and lime juice are a staple in my kitchen. This thing gets used every day for a couple of months now and still holding up. It's one of the best, least expensive gadgets I bought in a long time.SIX Stars!
A1AWPWLHSF2UPC	1	1	I have nothing but praise for this product. It arrived well packaged in a paper bag, which allows it to breath and stay fresh when the customer gets it, and that bag sealed in plastic to protect it from the uncontrolled environments it might encounter during shipping. When I opened it, I was immediately hit with a delicious scent of fresh roasted hazelnuts. I couldn't resist eating a few right out of the bag.I cook often and use these chopped course in salads and especially tossed into freshly steamed asparagus. It's way more than I need at a time, so the rest got split into several smaller portions and vacuum packed. In the freezer they will keep almost as good as fresh for a year or more.SIX Stars!
A1AWPWLHSF2UPC	0	0	I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews before wasting money on this thing. Although it looks nice out of the packaging, it's all a facade. The problem with mine is in the part that connects to the tire stem. It's designed to shut off the flow of air unless it's pressed onto the tire. Leaving aside the fact that this is not necessary (who cares if air free-flows from the hose when it's not attached to a tire and you press the trigger) the nozzles seals up unless something presses in on it.My guess is the theory of how this is supposed to work is the little pin inside the tire stem pushes in on the inside of the nozzle to open it and allow airflow. But unless your tire already has some significant pressure or the stem pin has a pretty strong spring, it won't be able to push in the valve in this tool hard enough to allow air to flow. So when you pull the trigger, there a very brief spurt of air which pressurizes the red hose and seals the brass connector on the end. Now no air flows and your tool is locked up.You have release the trigger and stick a pen or toothpick into this tool to push back the valve and purge the red hose and start again only to have it close up again the moment you pull the trigger.I don't know what's wrong with the world these days. Everything is a facade of quality over guts of junk in order to squeeze the most optimal, maximal, last fraction of a penny profit from every last sale at any cost and nevermind if it harms the customer. The worst of it is that I would happily pay five times the cost of this tool for something of quality but it just isn't available. We're all reduced to the least common denominator and most of it, like this tool, comes from China.This thing is going back to Amazon. It's way too much trouble to send back given the price, but if people don't ding Amazon, they're going to continue to sell junk that is easier to take from the packaging to the trashcan than to send it back. So I'm taking whatever steps and time are required to return it.
A1AWZOSPV0TH6G	1	1	Of all the bands that came out sporting "The ___" names in 2002, The Vines is my favorite, and in fact, for a brief time this album brought back that thrill of excitement and exhiliration that I hadn't felt in almost ten years, since the first time I started listening to Nirvana. Yeah that's right I made a Nirvana comparison and what are you going to do about it? While they haven't supplanted Nirvana as my favorite band, the Vines have displayed incredible range on what is only their FIRST album(a greater range than Nirvana did on theirs, I daresay.)We've got some great punkish bursts like "Highly Evolved" and "Outtatheway", mid-tempo songs with catchy as hell melodies like "Sunshinin" and "Factory," and well-written softer numbers like "Autumn Shade" and "Country Yard". And let's not forget the standout single "Get Free": I pity the fool who can't see why it blows away painfully drab nu metal radio hits like Godsmack or Trapt. I will concede that they [were unacceptable] live, but that's irrelevant. If you buy this CD, which you should if you haven't already, all you'll hear is a tight package of rock bliss.
A1AWZOSPV0TH6G	0	0	OK, like many other reviewers here I have been a fan of the books for very many years. I couldn't believe it when I heard they'd finally make a movie out of this...and couldn't believe what I saw upon its release. It is flawed on many levels. The animation is pretty bad. The combined 2D heroes against the CGI draconians just doesn't work. The voices are OK, but the requisite cheesy dialogue is in full force. Why is it so hard to write a fantasy script with some dignity? In addition, the idea of trying to cram the entire book into this short time is doomed from the outset. The story could never be done justice that way. I know the Chronicles would make an awesome anime series if you could do just one or two chapters in a half-hour episode. That way you could develop the characters and settings properly, which is really where the strength of Dragonlance lies. Oh well, I'm sure that is a pipe dream as there will never be the budget for that. For anyone who gave this a positive review, here is an objective test you should consider: Would you be proud to show this to a non-Dragonlance fan? I'd be more embarassed.All that said, this clunker will still not dull my love of the books, which I will defend to the death. If you've never read the books and saw this, I can only beg you to overlook this subpar product and consider giving the books a fair chance. Then you will see why so many were looking forward to this, and why they were disappointed.
A1AWZOSPV0TH6G	1	1	Couldn't agree more with everyone else's sentiments here regarding the two buffoons in the bar. Those cutscenes are AWFUL. Not to mention the perfectly poured glasses of beer on the counter and Lenny Clarke's HIDEOUS outfit.That being said, every Red Sox fan should see this. It fills a need to document what was simply one of the greatest sports dramas ever witnessed.If I had my druthers, I'd kind of like to see something spanning the whole 7 games. I think it would set the stage a bit better overall.And you know what else-why doesn't Damon's grand slam in game 7 get more play? That was the single greatest moment for me. Game 7 was a bit anti-climactic, but you didn't know that in the 2nd inning. Does anyone remember that the Yanks brought in a new pitcher and Damon hit the FIRST PITCH out? Sweet, sweet justice that was.
A1AX0ODP765ENY	0	0	Steer clear of this trash! Don't buy into any seller's description that claim's they have a 100% working and verified copy because their probably lying! Doesn't matter if it's new or used, the disc's are defective from Bandai. Mine were bought used with no scratches but that doesn't make any difference. I got to episode #4 before the skipping and freezing started. I even resurfaced disc #1 to try to correct the issue but apparently just wasted my time since it has to due with the data on the disc itself and not the disc physically!Waste of time and money. First time I've ever run into a problem like this. Great anime series ... poor product release.You think they would've release a newer version by now to correct this problem. Maybe if were lucky, Funimation will buy the rights to it and re-release it the way it should've been release to begin with!BTW ... Bandai's doesn't offer any support for their products anymore. There ticket support system is a joke and doesn't work! So if you get a defective product from them don't expect Bandai to issue you a replacement disc because they apparently don't care who they rip off now! This goes for other anime releases too!11-30-2012 -Update-----------------------------Bandai finally did response to my support ticket .... more than a month later! I had totally forgotten about it and it took me a little while to figure out why Bandai was emailing me. They shipped me a replacement disc (in a speedy manner) which worked perfectly. Only problem was that I had already bought a known working copy off eBay instead! Now I have two working copies of the same anime series! Yes, Bandai did remedy the problem but their so slow it's pathetic!
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	1	I was introduce to this product several years ago at a salon. I have continued to to use ISO products ever since. A very small amount of this product goes along way making it economical. The results are less fading of commerical hair color,very soft and managable hair.
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	1	For fine tuning the carb on the Husqvarna 435 chainsaw, it works great! Seeing how the carb is never spot on out-of-box this tool is a must have!
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	0	This is my first axe (at least the first one I've ever bought for myself) and I must say it's not like any axe I ever used before! First off, it's definitely lightweight and has a cool plastic carrying handle that protects the blades edge when not in use. I'll be using it the majority of the time for driving felling wedges when cutting timber!
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	1	If you run out of reflective tape for your Photo Tach Tool ... here you go ... it works so what more can you say right?
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	1	Pretty decent anime as far as this genre goes but darn is it twisted towards the end! First, he treats one girl as if she was a slave and then she flips her lid and goes psycho .... no surprise there. Was kind of hoping for a darker twist, like her going psycho and then end up killing him because by the end of the series he was really starting to annoy me ... oh well. The committing suicide to save the girl he chose is fairly twisted if you as me. Heck if I'd slash my wrist with a box cutter save some idiot with a death wish .... lol!Overall, it's an ok anime ... seen better!
A1AX0ODP765ENY	1	1	I thought I had seen some creepy anime before but this one takes it to a whole new level! Some episodes literally made the hair on my arm stand on end! The later episodes are down right bone chilling, especially "Bloody Labyrinth" ... in my opinion was the scariest!If you looking for a good scare then turn out the lights, crank up your surround sound system, and pop in Ghost Hunt ... this will get your heart a racing or just maybe freak you out to the point that you'll end up sleeping with the lights on ... lol!
A1AXJIUZ7PWV3J	1	1	In the film, Veronique catches just a glimpse of her "other self" as a bus pulls away, but that glimpse raises the question: suppose the two Valentines actually did meet? Such a meeting would pose some fascinating questions, I think. And the possibility of such a meeting made me recall two wonderful pieces of fiction by the master Argentinean poet/philosopher/writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986). In two of his short stories such meetings actually do occur; "The Other" (from "The Book of Sand" - 1975) and "August 25, 1983" (from "Shakespeare's Memory" - 1983). Could Kieslowski have read these works?
A1AXJIUZ7PWV3J	0	0	Because of the K.K. relationship I went to a fair amount of trouble to obtain this (my copy is Region 2, PAL, whereas I am Region 1, NTSC). The story-line seemed to have great possibilities, and it would indeed have been wonderful to see what K.K. would have done with it. But try as he did, Danis Tanovic's rendition leaves a lot to be desired. One of the most bizarre elements in the film is the hair on Carole Bouquet. Part that really brought a smile to my old face: the old lady shuffling up to the waste disposal to put a bottle in (K.K. lovers will understand). Wish I could recommend, but no.Where was Piaf when we needed her?
A1AXJIUZ7PWV3J	1	1	Five stars! K.K. would have loved it! Story line, acting, cinematography, all without fault. If you loved Veronique, Decalogue, Three Colors, you will love this film. Not to be missed!!
A1AXJIUZ7PWV3J	1	1	Probably unusual, but I purchased this strictly to be used INDOORS, on a VERY cold, windowed back porch where I am forced to retreat in order to enjoy a cigarette. The seat is WONDERFUL !! With the temperature on the porch being around 20 degrees, within minutes my bottom and back are toasty warm. If the seat maintains this level of performance I will remain delighted. Highest possible recommendation!
A1AXK6GSE1M1AK	1	1	I am a black belt and certified instructor in TaeKwonDo, so I am very picky about "kickboxing" workout videos. They are usually either way too complex for people who are not trained in martial arts (i.e., the moves required at the pace demanded present a very high injury risk for those who have not been formally trained in how to do them), or they are done by workout instructors who don't seem to have ever done kickboxing outside of an aerobics class.This is an excellent kickboxing workout video for everyone, martial artists and non-martial artists alike, and Patricia Moreno has clearly had formal kickboxing training. The moves are basic enough so that there should be a low risk of injury, but they are strung together in a way that provides great opportunities to practice strength, flexibility, and precision. Martial artists can always benefit from practicing these things, no matter how complicated or basic the moves, and the moves are very accessible to non-martial artists. The cardiovascular workout is great!The only complaints I have about this video are that there really should be more stretching before and after the workout to reduce the risk of muscle pulls and injury (I strongly recommend you do this on your own before starting the workout), and one of Patricia Moreno's backup kickbox girls is just terrible! She has no precision and no strength behind her moves, which is unfortunate, since Moreno emphasizes both of these elements quite heavily.I strongly recommend this video to those looking for a great accessible kickboxing workout.
A1AXK6GSE1M1AK	0	1	I love Red Dwarf, and I think that it's one of the best comedy shows around. I was so excited to see the release of this DVD. Unfortunately, the show was just awful. It could have and should have been so much funnier. The writers did a huge disservice to the characters and to the show, and as a consequence, to the viewers. I thought that Robert Llewellyn, Chris Barrie and Danny John-Jules were great in their respective roles, but Craig Charles' Lister of today just did not strike me as the Lister of yesterday. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't Lister-y enough for me! Maybe as Lister would be if too mellowed by age?I thought the laughs were few and far between, and again, the story itself was just miserable. The main good thing that came out of it is it got me to pull out season one again, and that reminded me why I love Red Dwarf.
A1AXK6GSE1M1AK	1	1	I bought this book for my six year-old niece. We have read the book cover-to-cover, and she absolutely loves it! This book is one that she brings to me and then crawls up into my lap to read through with me. She brings it with her in the car when we go places, and she looks through it in the back seat.Her two year-old brother has also sat in my lap while we look at this book, and his "What's that?" questions show that the book can even engage his growing mind (for a short while). :-)
A1AXK6GSE1M1AK	1	1	The Ab Assault video is a very good abs video, and I was sore the next day. The work with the ball really helps target the ab muscles. Adding weight can help the workout be more challenging for those who are already in shape, and beginners can be easily challenged without weight. I could do with fewer shots of Brooke Burke mugging for the camera, but it's not *that* big of a distraction.The Full Body Challenge workout is a really good full body toning workout. It can be made more or less challenging by adding or decreasing weight, and it does feel like it hits almost every muscle group. It does seem to forget about directly targeting hamstrings, though, and a few more reps of each exercise would be a plus. Brooke is not in that video, which is good, in my opinion. The individuals working out in this video do provide strong examples of how to perform the exercises properly and effectively.Neither workout is strongly cardio, but both are good for toning. Other videos can provide cardio workouts that can supplement these.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	1	1	I just bought this item about a month ago and it works great with Linux. I had used a SanDisk MP3 player but the SanDisk player will not play MP3 files encoded over 128K. This player has no problem. I also like the fact that I don't need an external cable to connect to a PC like the SanDisk with USB. Only drawback is the transfer rate with the V100 is slower then with the SanDisk but this is not a problem for me.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	0	1	I had been using these for several years and finally had to give them up. As a previous reviewer stated the ear cups are pealing and leaving little black specs everywhere. Besides one can't wear these for more than an hour without them feeling uncomfortable. The cord has held up well for the several years though.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	0	1	I purchased this unit several years ago and has worked well until recently. I was unable to eject a DVD from the unit. After taking it all apart and taking the top off the DVD player I found that around the spindle there is a pad that has become sticky and every time a DVD is put in the recorder it jams and makes it unable to eject the disk. I have never had a problem with a CD or DVD unit like this. Obviously a bad design.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	0	0	I purchased this container and it leaks like crazy. It does not matter how tight you tighten the cap on the side. It works its way loose and starts leaking. Also there is a screen on the top below the top lid. It easily falls through the top hole and winds up in the oil.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	0	0	This used to be my favorite magazine. I have been a subscriber for years. Unfortunately since Bloomberg bought it has gone straight down hill. It is becoming more and more of a political magazine and less and less dealing with business. The political comment is strictly liberal.When my subscription expires I will not be renewing. The bottom line is if you like liberal politics then this is the magazine for you. If you want business coverage you will need to look elsewhere.
A1AXN6GG44ELZV	1	1	I purchased another brand and they lasted only about a year. I bought these 2 years ago and not one has failed. I also notice no reduction in holding of a charge. These are definitely working as advertised.
A1AXOD5UFL0KLV	1	1	THIS IS EXCELLENT ALBUM I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA BE ANY GOOD BUT IT WAS DEFINITLY A GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENT I MEAN KELIS REALLY SURPRISES YOU WITH THIS THE ROCK FLAVOR BUT BESIDES THAT IT IS GREAT KELIS DEFINITLY HAS WAS IT TAKES TO BE A TOP NOTCH ARTIST MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE FLASHBACK TRICK ME IN PUBLIC AND MILLIONARE MY LEAST FAVORITE IS MILKSHAKE CAUSE EVERY SONG ON THE CD IS GREAT SO PLAY WHEN I CAN HERE IT ON THE RADIO THIS CD IS DEFINITLY A MUST WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO HAVE GOOD QUALITY MUSIC AT FIRST I WAS NERVOUS CAUSE IT WAS MY FIRST KELIS AND THAT CAUGHT OUT THERE WAS CRAZY BUT THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE

BUT IF YOU WANT THIS CD SUPPORT ASHANTI MAYBE YOULL LIKE IT
A1AXRXQ4F70XFT	0	0	I was so excited to see this film and found it a big boring disappointment. What a waste of acting talent, and what sophmoric, showoffy, directing and writing. Real piece of crap.
A1AXXXLJPZNBKP	1	1	An enjoyable historical novel, with vivid heros and villains. If you have an interest in the Roman Empire, this would be a good introduction. The book is well-written, with the material taken from credible historical sources, such as Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch, and Josephus.
A1AXXXLJPZNBKP	0	0	I tried to be fair and open-minded, but this book was painful. The unsupported speculation, exaggerations, and BS leave the reader with a grossly distorted view of Jesus of Nazareth and his life. There are NO facts presented that originate in any CREDIBLE historical source in support Mr. Chilton's pontifications. There are occasional cultural / political / historical truths presented that are helpful; that being said, you can find truths in historical fiction novels like King Jesus, by Robert Graves.Of the two, I'd stick with Graves.
A1AY6OMS00ZTLL	1	1	The fan works great, as advertised. No gripes here, but then again, it's hard to really have any major complaints about a battery operated fan.
A1AY6OMS00ZTLL	1	1	It's a reptile lamp. It's does exactly what was advertised. I've had it for 6 months now, and it still works like the day I got it. My box turtle does seem healthier since I got the light as well. Hope this helps.
A1AY6OMS00ZTLL	1	1	Since I've gotten this book and practiced some of the things I learned, I've really noticed some improvement. Easy tips that can shave an hour here, 20 minutes there, 5 minutes here and there, and they all add up. You start off doing a self-assessment to identify the largest gaps. From here, you can, and I recommend you do, skip to your largest area of opportunity and start closing the gaps. If your like me, you'll see a improvement right away. As a recent grad who spent more time in college "GOING to study..." than actually studying, there was some real opportunity for improvement.
A1AYC6Z4XO8DCA	1	1	this album is dangerous, not for children and could influence someone to commit a violent crime, this album features the most talented MC of not only cash money records but perhaps the entire state of LA, juvenile and lil wayne get all the glory, but B.G. is easily the best rapper of the click, and its not even close. the only rapper to ever come out of LA that might rival B.G. for his crown may be young bleed who is from baton rouge LA, but its really close, and this album is BY FAR B.G.s best work, a must have for any fan of gangsta rap, not only louisiana rap. Juvenile makes one of his earliest apperances and BUN B is also featured on this album
A1AYC6Z4XO8DCA	1	0	im from louisiana, and have been listening to all the local music for a long time, this album is one of the top ten rap albums to ever come out of this state, Lil wayne, one of the nations top rappers, spits some killer verses to some of manny freshes best beats, apperances by the other "hot boys" members can also be found on this album which features the rap talents of manny fresh and bryan williams before they went all comercial and screwed up cash money records, because in my opinion, after the release of juveniles "the G code" and B.G.s chopper city in the ghetto, cash money just went down hill, but if you get all the stuff that came out before that, you may throw away any other rap CDs you have, because between UNLV's uptown4life and lil waynes the block is hot album, cash money, song for song, is right up there with death row
A1AYHY3JYW2W0D	0	0	I read this book after reading the review of others. I have to say this book will not go into my library of books to keep. I really expected alot better from this author, since his books continue to sell despite his death.The book had little action, and did not excite me. I found the confrontation at the end to be the most exciting part of the book! Really thought it could of used more action throughout.Most of the book was building its way to the final 4 chapters, guess what I am trying to say was that I was really just plain disappointed by this author.
A1AYHY3JYW2W0D	1	1	This is the only product which can clear up my sinuses in such a short amount of time. The only problem I have is that it could taste better..
A1AYHY3JYW2W0D	1	1	Ater reading Cruel and Unusual, this book definitley lived up to my expectations! Loved it!
A1AYSEZAC18XXH	0	0	I finished reading this book only because I'm on vacation and short of other books. Also, I couldn't believe that there wouldn't be more to it at some point. Ms. Morris does write fairly well. There are some errors in the text and she clearly is not a craftwoman - she doesn't do the research at various points to name animals (for instance the 'large rodent' in the Guatemalan jungle). The critiques of other reviewers are very correct - she is self-absorbed, but not in an interesting way. The entire book is of her taking from others what she can, with very little giving back, except to her generous neighbor, Lupe, and even in that relationship it doesn't feel as if she's really able to be humanly touched. Her travel descriptions are pathetically shallow and useless for those of us who are curious and want to know the flavor of places. The texture and description which bring the essence of a place to a reader are mostly absent. The whole book reads as a cryptic list of 'places I've been with the crummy places I stayed while there and how I didn't like it' saga. I would have given the book one star, except Ms. Morris does have some writing ability. I'm very surprised this book is still in print. Ms. Morris has now had a number of other books printed and I for one can't imagine ever picking one of them up after having read this one. If those books are better than this one, Ms. Morris, do yourself a favor and take this one out of circulation.
A1AYSEZAC18XXH	0	0	I'm not going to repeat what other reviewers who have also given this production of Persuasion 1 star have said - they have been exactly right - I'm only adding my one star to bring the rating down as a whole. I pre-ordered this sight-unseen based on other British productions of Jane Austen which have at least striven for authenticity. Watching this version of Persuasion was truly horrible and my copy is going into circulation as a used version to keep people who don't know better from buying directly from the producers.
A1AYXLZE7UI5DZ	1	1	Read this book. So many novels are OK as you read through them and then have disappointing endings -- as though the publisher said "Deadline's comin' up. End it already." Until the very last page I was worried about how this book would end . . . but the ending was exquisite. Absolutely perfect. I will wait a few months and then go back and read it again, savoring the beautiful writing, and viewing all the characters' actions with the added insight of what was *really* going on. In the meantime, I'll go find and read her other novels.
A1AYXLZE7UI5DZ	1	1	I picked this up at the library, having never heard of Minotaur. I loved it -- and I read voluminously across a wide variety of fiction and nonfiction. The characters are certainly believable and the side-excursions into various not-quite-relevant-to-the-plot topics are the best part. I *know* people like Benny and Dink. He has captured the true flavor of parts of the deep south. I laughed outloud, I winced, I marveled at the outrageousness of some of the story lines (Max was especially despicable). I swear I could taste the hushpuppies. At heart, it's a darn good yarn. Don't listen to the critics! Just go read it.
A1AYXLZE7UI5DZ	0	0	This book sounded great. However . . . lame story, completely unrealistic portrayal of archeological excavations. Did not live up to expectations.
A1AYYNGKI0U4M0	0	0	These smoke alarms looked like a good buy, but when we tried to install them (using a manual screwdriver), the screw heads broke off in our ceiling, leaving the shanks embedded in the wood. We removed them with pliers (with some difficulty) and then installed the alarms with new screws of our own. The poor qualilty of the screws caused us an unreasonable amount of extra work and frustration. We have not had the alrarms long enough to comment on their longevity.
A1AYYNGKI0U4M0	0	1	Everything I bake sticks to these pans. They are a nice heavy weight, but are not usable without a silicone liner. I have a pair of very battered 45-year-old pans that work much better. Other reviewers have had better experiences, so perhaps not all of these are the same.
A1AYYNGKI0U4M0	0	1	The squirrels have not managed to get into this bird feeder, but they don't need to. It spills so much seed that there is plenty for them on the ground. It spills when I try to fill it. It spills when larger birds try to eat. It spills when little birds eat. It spills in the wind. If the seed lands on my deck, the squirrels get it after all. If it lands in a flower pot, it sprouts and I have millet along with flowers.It looks OK and might work if you have squirrels and have a place to hang the feeder where a lot of seed on the ground is not a problem.
A1AZ1EULVB5FEF	0	1	Maybe my baby was unusually strong and tall; however, this flimsy blanket would not hold him from the moment he came home from the hospital. We thought my mom (his grandma) would have an easier time using the SwaddleMe than using the origami-style wrapping of hospital receiving blankets... but it was a total joke.Having lost faith in all the quick wraps, I was as surprised as anyone when we had to turn to the "Amazing Miracle Blanket" when he was too strong and tall to stay swaddled in our tightest blanket wraps. The name just sounded too silly to me, but I'm a convert. I highly recommend that product instead.
A1AZ1EULVB5FEF	1	1	Add the water, push the button, done.I would recommend this product to anyone with a new baby. It is excellent: easy-to-use, quick, reliable. I don't have to worry that a new babysitter will accidentally do it wrong -- any first-timer can get it right.When we're away from home feeding bottles, I really miss this bottle warmer because we're left guessing on how long to keep the bottle in the hot water so that it's neither too hot nor too cold.
A1AZAXGKOH39PU	1	1	I recently purchased this CD after returning from a trip to Italy, which re-awakened my love of Italian music. I primarily bought this CD based on the reviews it received here on Amazon.While it took a few listens for me to warm up to this CD, I have grown to like it a lot! I mean, how can you NOT like most of the songs on this CD? The collection is quite representative of many types of Italian music and as another contributor stated, many of the songs on the CD have been heard time and time again...nothing new.But that's the beauty of this CD! While I've heard better renditions of some tunes (like Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu), the rest of the CD is great with classic popular 50's-60's Italian-American tunes that you will surely recall with a smile (think Pepino, Eh Cumpari, Ciao Ciao Bambina, Come Prima and more).We've heard these songs in movies, we've listened to them while dining at Italian restaurants, we remember many of the tunes from visting with Grandma on a Sunday. I wouldn't want this CD to be my only collection of Italian tunes but it truly is a lot of fun! Great memories.Now, the ONLY reason I did NOT give this CD 5 stars is because (while it is a gorgeous song), I don't get why "Spanish Eyes" is on the CD ('cause Al Martino is Italian???). Nor do I understand why Cara Mia Amore, Runaround, Here In My Heart and a few other songs are on a CD citing it's "100% Italian-American Classics."...I don't get it.Would I consider Jay and the Americans' "Cara Mia Amore" a great Italian tune...uh, no! How about "Love Is A Many Splendid Thing?"...uh, no...that's not Italian. But overall, this CD is a good listen & lots of fun!Toni Lee Fiore(John Matrunich's loving wife)
A1AZAXGKOH39PU	0	1	I decided to write an Amazon review after losing my 3rd Dyson vacuum yesterday...the 3rd one in under 5 years. My first 2 Dyson vacs were the DC-14 models. The first vacuum lasted around 2.5 years and did a very good job...for a while. After losing suction, it wasn't worth the cost to repair the vacuum & motor. I bought a second DC-14, which never seemed to have the suction of the first one but the motor burnt out after a year or so. I attributed this to extended use (2-3 times a week) vacuuming 2100 sq foot house (mostly the living room, dining room, computer room, 1 bedroom) 2-3 times/week. So, I upgraded to the DC-17 Animal or Absolute because I do have 2 shedding dogs and 1 cat...thought I'd have better luck with an "animal" friendly vacuum.Well, yesterday, the purple Animal or Absolute Dyson (DC-17) died...and I was so upset 'cause the thing cost me nearly $600 approximately 1 year ago. The DC-17 started to consistently lose suction and power over the past several months. Buttons (on-off, brush) stopped working properly. Vacuum CONSTANTLY started to over heat after 5 minutes of use. I cleaned the filter regularly after being told that an unclean filter contributed to the motor burnout of my 2nd DC-14 (???). However, like the second Dyson, this model disappointed after one year of careful use.I now bought a Bissell Dual Cyclonic Lift Off, which does not receive great reviews here on Amazon. I, too bought into the Dyson hype. I feel saddened that I have parted with yet another Dyson. When they work, the Dyson vacs clearly do a job unsurpassed by other vacuum cleaners. But with a life of under 2 years, I cannot afford these things at $600 a pop! After reading through dozens of vacuum reviews today, perhaps 1 year is the "new" shelf life on vacuums. My mom had a Hoover for 15 years; my husband has a Rainbow that has worked for 18 years. I'm confused and sick of buying vacuum cleaners!
A1AZAXGKOH39PU	1	1	Several months back. I bought my dear husband this silly little nylon food tote/carrier from our local Dollar Days. My husband looked somewhat forlorn carrying the Dollar tote to and from work each day but for the most part, it got the job done. Finally, the silly item fell apart but my husband really loved toting his lunch and stuff to work every day in that silly little nylon bag. Well, when the Dollar Store item died, I decided to buy my husband a "real" masculine lunch tote-smile. The Dead On Tools "Killer Chiller" bag is perfect for him! This lunch bag is a great item and a really cool product.When my husband first saw the Killer Chiller and compared it to his wimpy Dollar Store item, he balked at the size...so did I! But after one or two days of putting this great bag to use AND receiving tons of compliments on the bag from the guys and gals at work, my husband LOVES it! This bag is durable, extremely functional, heavy duty, practical and cool to carry. My husband is able to fit his daily salad and dressing in the bag along with some fruit, a few pieces of bread, a boxed microwaveable lunch item, some snacks, snack bars, etc. The bag is perfect and it really is not that huge! Oh yes...when it is not filled with food, my husband ALSO utilizes the top portion of the bag for bills & mail that must be dropped off at the post office on his way to work! We both love this bag! It is the best!
A1AZIGHBBEWIW3	0	1	Okaye, this toy arrived in a little padded envelope. It was tiny. It does not look like the photo. It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker. I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny! It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse. My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes. She's 13 lbs. I'm not crazy about the velcro and how you can take the squeakers out, that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out.
A1AZIGHBBEWIW3	1	1	I'm a big fan of the AKC toys because they are affordable and realistic. My dog especially enjoys the movement of the wings when we are playing and is able to squeak this toy, which is a big plus. She is a 13 lb Lhasa Apso who wakes up and falls asleep playing, silly silly girl, and has a small mouth. It takes her some work to get some toys to squeak, and we and SHE are very proud when she finally manages to do this.... This being said, I would say this dog toy gets 5 stars. She did not go crazy over it, but I have been buying her a lot of toys lately and she did enjoy it. I'll update my review as time passes but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and think it's one of the better AKC animals to buy if you are shopping around. Oh and they all SQUEAK, there is no animal like sound... But you know, my dog doesn't seem to care, she likes squeaking!
A1AZIGHBBEWIW3	1	0	This goose is smaller than our coleman toys, but the squeaker is buried in the toy so it's difficult for a smaller dog to squeak unless they have big mouths. It's more for a medium size dog. I did not hear honking! Anyhow, I liked the pheasant better for a small dog even though it's not a plush. Quality could be better but prices are more than reasonable, so that all dogs can have toys.
A1AZIGHBBEWIW3	0	0	This toy has rav reviews, so I was all over. NOT! I received teeny tiny package in it a teeny tiny reddish thing on cardboard. No stuffing I could just feel the squeaker. Velcro, so your pup can take OUT the squeaker if they are clever enough. (Mine is). Now I have a 13lb playful pup, she makes up games with everything and cherishes her toys. I presented it to her and she just looked at me like WHAT IS THAT, MOM? That COULD NOT BE A TOY. Squeaking did not help it was limp and lifeless on the floor. I put the "xtra" squeaker in it to make it a little more interesting as there was not much too this tiny mouse size toy.... Don't get the buzz, waste of my hard earned cash! Just be careful with that velcro, in my opinion it's totally unnecessary, get Coleman toys is you want a toy that last.
A1AZIGHBBEWIW3	1	1	What I really LOVE about this TOY is IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE for my 15lb pup to play with. Little dogs ARE indeed DOGS, and is exceptionally playful and active and not easy on toys (not a shredder). I mean, she killed a mole while on an extender leash. Other than moles, my dog is very social with dogs and people... she loves kids. She working on her Ph.D. in playing, so the children and her have a blast - the highlight of her day at least. When she is really kickin' it, her toys are tossed, shook, pounced on, dropped, thrown and when you think you are done they are in your face... it's full on playtime including wrestling for the toy with mom or canine friends. At first, my dog would ONLY play FETCH w/ Look Who is Talking Koala, but that's IT... and she would look at it sideways when it laughed, confused and conflicted, like my doggie instincts are saying that this is wrong, Mom. She recognized the sound of the laughing children! However, time has passed and now this toy has joined her regular rotation, so I updated my review. She no longer gets disturbed and confused by the giggling, she just jumps, pounces on it, carries it around, fetches it and it is the toy most often at my feet and she a TON. Don't even have to make it giggle! And when it does giggle she goes instantly into play mode. I think having got the duck and chick version of this toy for xmas helped change her thinking somehow. THE SIZE IS PERFECT, I think that's part of her love of this toy, she can trigger the noise box of some of them herself, i.e. (the duck) or any of them when she is playing a lot with them. They are very cute toys, but really, people complaining about the size must not realize I have the same disappointments just with different toys, i.e., Coleman toys, which are gorgeously made, most of which are just way to big for anything bug some fetch. Also, since she is not a destroyer, generally, her toys require sewing at the seams, they are turning into a favorite. She does like the koala's fluffy ears a lot, too ;-) She likes the cat, but it is not as fluffy, the dog noise she just doesn't buy into... It's a little mechanical sounding and again not as plush as the Koala. I tell you, I need an entire army of them!

I write this review only to advise prospective buyers of this company. My unit which is a lesser unit than this is on its fourth season, used for two seasons once and a third twice. At the end of last season it became intermittant and now will not pull soap into it. I kept stored in a garage which does not freeze in the winter. I have used it for several hours each time to wash my single story home and a couple of times to wash my car. I am very disappointed and will not buy another Karcher.
A1AZQCVCDBQP6	1	1	This fan is very quiet. It replaced a high end Pabst fan with less CFM. The case I placed the fan in creates a bit of wind noise as the air is pulled in. Non restricted flow is critical to getting the most from a high quality fan with lowest circulation noise. I used this one without the speed control yellow wire.The difference between this fan and the Pabst it replaced besides the airflow... when you manually turn the fan, there is not noticeable feel as with the Pabst. Sooo very smooth.
A1AZQCVCDBQP6	0	0	Tough to buy this device without specs. There's also a typo: I would guess this is a 1/8 HP compressor.
A1AZQCVCDBQP6	1	1	Just what I need for a piece of equipment which had a cable that was too short. This a male to female extension cable.
A1AZQCVCDBQP6	0	1	I started watching on PC, then switched to Xoom, this does not work. Finding the video is no easy task on my Amazon home page either. I was watching this series on Netflix on both my PC desktop and on my Xoom. When I ran out of seasons on Netflix, found it on Amazon. I am a regular amazon customer and spend thousands per year on equipment for my business.... I started at season 5 EP 18? I was on 2! This need some serious fixing. The video quality is much better on Amazon, I will them credit for this.
A1AZRDW6L2TKW7	1	1	This movie represents the ultimate Achievement in comic book movies. Not just for the quality of the movie itself but for the massive storyarch Built by the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. All the movies that make up Marvel's "Phase One" Average out to be Awsome. Yes the Hulk movies were weak and I rightfully expected more that the so-so product got out of the God of Thunder's first Movie, but when the Marvel Cinematic Univerese hits it mark it REALLY HITS its mark. The First Iron Man Movie was great and I was pleasently suprised to see that Captian America: The First Avenger not only the best pre Avengers movie of Phase one but the best Super Hero movie of that Summer (and there was a lot of them that summer).Though the M.C.U. story arch was and is not perfect but it kept all us nerds begging for more building up the excitement for the big payoff. The Avengers, which to my great suprise only continued to build up to the real payoff. After all the laughs, action, great proformaces, (and in my opion much better writting than this series gets credit for) The biggest payoffs are yet to come.Spoiler Alert-----------------------At the end of the movie the signature line up of heroes is still not realized. Avengers tower is not finished and a New great Villian rears his ugly head in the middle of the Credits. The Avengers will not be fully assembled and realized until at least the end of Marels Phase Two.
A1AZRDW6L2TKW7	1	1	This boxset is the entire First season of the sensational and vastly underrated 2003 Teenage Mutnat Nija Turtles show. Where the sadly more iconic 80's version of the Turtels were slapstick, corney and way too tounge in cheek, THESE TURTLES are badass the way mutants and Ninjas are supposed to be.This Series Helmed by the one and only Peter Laird (Creator of the original TMNT comic Books) Brings the true vison of the Turtles to life. Great non goofy action sequences, serious well written plotines, Great Charecters as Peter Laird originally intended them. No more Whinney Shredder, Make way for the badass, ruthless, mysterious, Conniving Shredder. We also have Baxter Stockman back to his original glory and April O'neil now not needing to be saved every 5 minutes.It only gets better from here cause seasons 2, 3, and 4 are only going to be better.
A1AZTVETP77WVB	1	1	Is it possible to say anything new about a book that has been in print for ~30 years, that has been read by millions, and which is widely studied in schools and universities?No... but I do want to say that I loved every word (and illustration). You can pick up this old novel and get a very fresh outlook both on the human condition and on how novels ought to be written.Vonnegut writes like he is explaining life on Earth to alien children. It is a tool that produces incredibly poignant satire, which he uses effectively to give commentary on conditions of life that the vast majority of us accept without even noticing. The language used is very simple but wonderfully lyrical, less-than-average readers will fly right through it.Although clearly sadenned by his life, and by his observations of the planet, Vonnegut wrote a masterpiece that remains hopeful in its despair.Kurt Vonnegut is a genius, and will no doubt be recognized as one of the 20th Century's greatest.
A1AZTVETP77WVB	0	0	Visiting the book store some time ago, I noticed that the author of this novel has busied himself converting Phil Dick's masterpiece into a franchise. Having read Noir, I am not too tempted to see how Jeter may have twisted Bladerunner's already dark milieu.Action in this novel starts out right away, but I had to read the first chapter over, because I could not picture Jeter's scene.Noir is brutal. It is the sickest and most perverse future vision I have ever read. Not that that is necessarily bad, but.. Imagine a world were even death is no escape from your creditors; where mysterious machines shoot down every aircraft that ever leaves the ground; where copyright infringement is punishable by means far, far worse than death... and it goes on and on.On the post-apocalyptic Earth human life is a worthless commodity. Sexuality is explored in many forms, but invariably they are sickly perverse and closely linked to death and mutilation. This did more to demonstrate the author's own inclinations than to present anything remotely plausible. The penalty for selling someone else's intellectual property in Jeter's world is to have one's brain and spinal chord forcefully removed and placed on life support. The offender's still-living, still-aware neural tissue is then used to make stereo cables or to control small household appliances for the personal amusement of the artist or author that was wronged. Doesn't take much analysis to see the author's own personal agendas being manifested here.The protaganist is an 'asp-head', and agent of the Collection Agency, the company that performs the torturous executions as described above. He is a non-dimensional character who is, of course, very darkly motivated. There is nothing good at all in McNihil's life, he has made sure of that. The hero has taken the steps to have his vision altered so that the world appears to be a darkened version of the world of 1930's cinema. There is no daytime in McNihil's world, a condition that suits well the otherwise flat character.All of Jeter's frequent cultural references, and his occasional use of German quotes are both totally incomprehensible. This may not be entirely bad though, as it does seem to add something, though certainly not authenticity. One thing is clear: Jeter's southern California is much different from any that anyone will ever see.Finally, Jeter calls into question his own knowledge of the use of the English language, using the word 'connect' as a direct replacement for our beloved 'f' word. I.e. You are such a connecting loser, and so on. That, sadly is his only attempt at modifying dialog to appear authentically futuristic, and it doesn't work at all.I finished Jeter's Noir, and found to my surprise that he managed to salvage a decent ending from this rather unredeemably twisted work.
A1AZUS49YMO0X	0	0	In this book, one can learn that: The internet started as a Defense Department project in the 80's p. 120 The proper way to search for pager manufacturing in internet web search engines is just to mention &quot;pager&quot;, and not worry at all about other key words or symbols. p. 124 That, according to an intelligence project, pager repair could be a great business. p.139 I was lead to believe by a book review that this book would give me a great deal of information about passive intelligence gathering. It does not live up to its promise, and lacks credibility for so many factual (1,1969 2, +pager +manufacture + industry +trends ) and analytical (3 I threw my cell phone away, and got another for free)errors. What a shame.
A1AZUS49YMO0X	1	1	Dennis Pagen has professionalized the presentation of HG instruction in many works, and deserves the gratitude of HG pilots world wide.This book, and the clear presentation of important concepts of thermaling, cross country flying, and speed-to-fly theory make it a gem of gliding knowledge for weekend and competition pilots.
A1B124AVX0QH2B	0	1	Does not play full 1080P Resolution = dvd 1.5. You might want to wait till the 1080P players come down in price before buying an HD player.
A1B124AVX0QH2B	0	1	Why would you buy a player that uses an out of date format? Maybe cause its $50. Microsoft is making a blu-ray add on now, so if you plan to watch alot of HD movies on your 360 you might want to wait.
A1B124AVX0QH2B	1	1	I have been playing video games since the first playstation came out and I was never much into the Gran Turismo series...until I downloaded the GT5P demo from Japan back in October. Ive been playing that demo over and over and cant get enough. Now that I have the actual GT5P game, I realize that this is going to keep me busy till the full GT5 game comes out. Even if your not a car fanatic, you should still check this game out, its alot of fun to play.
A1B124AVX0QH2B	1	0	Is it possible to give a game an 11? If so, this would be the game that would merit that score. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a title that exceeds all of the hype that was attached to the title. Regardless of whether you've seen every trailer and screenshot, read every preview and heard every interview, you won't get a full sense of how phenomenal this title is unless you sit down and experience it for yourself.
A1B1G0F3W6VAL5	1	1	Paul S Kemp is great. he knows how to make you really care about all the characters. excellent book. excellent series.
A1B1G0F3W6VAL5	0	0	the main character is whiney. the hero is annoying and their attemp at a love story fails. not a good book at all.
A1B1G0F3W6VAL5	1	1	these clickers are awesome. make sure you attach to a coily keychain or something like that so you can attach it to your belt loop - you're gonna want to carry it with you everywhere you go with your dog!
A1B1TXRHG0CF4K	0	0	Well I had been a fan of Netgear up until this router. This is my third netgear router and the other two (both 802.11b) had performed flawlessly. I have owned this router for about 8 months and it just recently started dropping connections. I have seen other reviewers mention reliability issues as well. At first I blamed wireless interference from my neighbors but after connecting direclty to the router via ethernet cable I could still not get a connection. I could not even access the router login and no response to pings. I cycled power but no luck. Then I happened to pick up the router and noticed that I could pretty much cook lunch on the thing it was so hot. After disconnecting power and letting it cool down it works fine until it heats back up again and drops the connection. Not exactly what I am looking for in a router. Now if I was looking for a combo router/hotplate this would fit the bill but I'm not. So this bad boy is headed for the trash and I'll be trying another brand. Any suggestions??
A1B1TXRHG0CF4K	1	1	I have owned this router for about 8 months now. Past routers consisted of 3 different Netgear models and a Dlink. This router blows all of those away. It is highly configurable and the mimo gives it incredible range. I have over 4000 square feet in my house on 3 levels and it covers all of it with no problems even though the router is located in the basement. I can still get a good to excellent signal 2 floors above!! The router is also very stable and has not required any rebooting to maintain connections. I frequently access my home network remotely (VNC and Slingbox) while traveling and have never had a router related issue prevent me from doing that.It is important to mention that this router model has been plagued with a power supply issue and mine fell victim as well. Apparently, the power supply shipped with quite a few units degrades over time and eventually cannot supply enough current to the router causing it to randomly reset. Zyxel has a web page form at http://us.zyxel.com/replacement/. Fill it out and they will send you a new power supply. Mine arrived via 2 day Fedex. No problem getting somebody at Zyxel on the phone either. Great customer service! Even with this issue I would highly recommend this router.
A1B1V7TXR3Z17	1	1	well alot of the people who review this would say they sound the same in this one as they did in the sound of heartache but i would not agree. They do have the same setup as the end of heartace but they are a lttile diffrent in this one they sing alot more in this one and the screaming meshes so well with the singing another thing they did was incorporated adams screaming alot more in this one then in the end of heartache so all in all i loved this one alot more than the end of heatache yes they did put alot of what alot of ppl would call "emo" lyrics but you really can't say that because all music is emotional if it wasnt why would we listen to it so i say give this album a try and spend the little money it cost for it. so i say a five yeah
A1B1V7TXR3Z17	0	0	i have to agree with alot of people on this review im sorry but trivium turned into a wuss band now the first 2 albums were good but this one is crap they let all that "the next metallica" crap go to there heads and now they sold out and suck they need to go back to the old style this stuff where the lead singer dosent scream is crap start screaming again and maybe i will like it this album just wasnt trivium in any way so basically this album blows compared with there other albums
A1B1V7TXR3Z17	1	1	i just bought doom and i like it it has everything that i like in a band heavy guitars good rifts good drums and brutal vocals. I dont know why nobody likes this band because in my opinion they put out a solid release here they are new and if you have been to there myspace lately you can hear a new song from there new album genesis which sounds like they have grown since this album they were young when this came out and i think they did the best they could so just listen to it and decide if you like it.
A1B1V7TXR3Z17	1	1	i really like the way they went on this cd they took out the pig squeals and breakdowns which in my book made them diffrent. Until i heard genesis i did not think i was going to like this cd but i popped it in and what came out was like music to my ears it really is a good cd a big move from doom which is a good thing. They grew up and it shows i hope a bunch of the scene kids stop flocking to them but whatever they are a good band i would have given it a 4.5 because of the shortness but its still a good cd so i gave them a 5. Also to the person who asked about "core" it is a certain genre. It is tacked on to everything because of all the diffrent genres. deathcore is like grind,metalcore,death metal. This cd is more death metal than doom and it is actually good death metal so if you like brutal drums and good guitars you probably will like this cd. so listen to it and see if you like it.
A1B24WNOBTYYB2	1	1	I loved the movie and gave it a four stars! i also did love the ending. like to know how to get that last song alright by oliva d'abo cant find it any were!!!
A1B27F6VVEPY90	1	0	Apparently the other person that reviewed this does not own the Blu Ray because this is the uncut 110 minute version!
A1B27F6VVEPY90	1	1	This movie bombed big time at the box office but I can't understand why. If you are a Thompson fan, or a Depp fan, or both, You will enjoy this. It's not as manic and crazy as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but it definitely has that Hunter S. Thompson feel to it.
A1B27F6VVEPY90	1	0	This is a great movie, with a wild and wacky performance by Nicholas Cage. But's it's almost as if they were embarrassed by how Cage looks in the movie, because this cover is totally wrong. In the film he has shaggy Black hair, a mustache, and he always wears sunglasses. The picture on the DVD seems to be from a completely different movie.
A1B2BWXLY398QU	0	0	I bought this vacuum about 6 months ago. It only works well when the bagless tray is empty. If it is not completely empty it leave debris all over the floor especially when you turn it off. I regret buying this, I should have spent an extra 100.00 and got a better vacuum. Avoid at all cost.
A1B2BWXLY398QU	0	0	I bought this vacuum from a retail store less than 10 months ago. At first I was pleased but about 2 months in I noticed that the vacuum lost suction...it blow debris around...I have to vacuum the same area repeatedly to remove visible dirt or artifacts. I have emptied the container but to no avail. I will give this away to the goodwill, the person that buys it will be disappointed but hey they only spent $20.00 so they won't feel too bad. Moreover, carpet fibers collect all over the front of the vacuum, it's disgusting. Also, the attachments keep falling off with the slightest touch. What a huge waste of money! I am looking for another vacuum and I will not even consider any vacuum made by Eureka that is how perturb I am with this product. Do not buy, no matter how many decent reviews you read!
A1B2BWXLY398QU	0	0	I must admit I knew this movie would be a disappointment but I was bored. Alas, I am even more disappointed as now my suspicions have been confirmed. This really is a bad movie. If there is a record for the number of times the F word has been used in a movie, I am quite sure Magic Mike would be the frontrunner. Is it called writing when ever other word is profane. I think a 16 year boy could have written a better script. Channing Tatum's body is nice but skip the movie it is not worth it.
A1B2BWXLY398QU	0	0	This film is ULTRA boring and the plot is ridiculously implausible. I kept waiting for the action or drama to start but it was boring from start to finish. Skip this rental it is not worth the money.
A1B2CD9R53HPS9	0	0	I chose Caveat Emptor, Latin for 'let the buyer beware', as the title of this review because it best describes how to approach a deal with this vendor for a Canon BP511A Lithium Ion battery. At the same time I purchased this battery from Vortex Cable (VC) I purchased one from Amazon.com. They both arrived within a couple of days of each other which allowed me the opportunity to compare them. Upon performing a visual inspection, side-by-side, I noticed subtle differences between the two, previously pointed out by various reviewers, which leads me to believe the VC version is a knock-off. I wouldn't have minded so much if the battery was advertised as a Canon and an obvious non-Canon replacement was sent, because you could easily discern that fact and ask for a replacement or your money back. In this case though someone went to great lengths to make this battery appear as a Canon...right down to the packaging. My recommendation is to avoid purchasing your battery here and pay a little more to ensure you are in fact receiving a true Canon replacement battery.
A1B2CD9R53HPS9	1	1	Having completely forgotten about this movie, I stumbled onto the soundtrack looking for a non-live version of the Keel-covered, Rose Tattoo song, 'Rock & Roll Outlaw'. When I determined that the Dudes soundtrack was the only place I'd find it, I bought it. Although originally purchased solely for that song, one listen showed me what a forgotten gem this CD really is. It contains a real good selection of music and is the only place to find the aformentioned Keel song and the Megadeath version of 'These Boots Are Made for Walking'. The CD also contains an excellent version of Jane's Addiction's Mountain Song. If you're on the fence about this purchase, get it now before it disappears.
A1B2CD9R53HPS9	1	1	Men Without Hats (MWH) are one of those bands that are polarly divisive. Since most people only know of them due to the catchy yet massively overplayed 'The Safety Dance', they either love or hate them. Folk of the 80's (Part III) came out in 1984, two years afterRhythm of Youth, and four years after the Folk of the 80's EP. Although rather short by CD standards, it is another example of MWH ability to produce a cohesive group of well-crafted pop tunes. Witty lyrics wrapped in catchy tunes provide this listener with an aural happy pill. My favorite songs on this CD are 'Messiahs Die Young' and 'I Sing Last/Not for Tears' but I can easily listen to the whole CD when I put it on. If you're a fan of 'Rhythm of Youth' and haven't listened to 'Folk of the 80's', you owe it to yourself to check this out. If you heard 'The Safety Dance' one time too many and now turn the radio off when it comes on, you owe it to yourself to check this out. Okay, just check it out!
A1B2NHX244XT25	1	1	My sons greatly enjoy the adventures of Clifford! I give this video 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is beginning to show it's age but it is still quite entertaining and educational.
A1B2NHX244XT25	1	0	Of the various travel guides to the area I have consulted I particularly like this edition from Fodor's. The information is arranged in a logical way and is invaluable for planning a trip. And planning such a trip is very important even with the changes in today's society. Even for those not traveling this book can serve as a pleasant reminder of earlier visits. It deserves a place on the traveler's bookshelf.
A1B2TOKZ188W4O	0	0	although the movie visuals were cool, the writing lacked a lot. there were also lots of scenes that were thrown together for laughs, that were just really, really STUPID!! spend time with spidey, captain jack, or the silver surfer all are better choices.
A1B2TOKZ188W4O	1	1	great fun for the entire family, from the days when the whole family, could watch tv together. dont miss it. merry Christmas!!
A1B2TOKZ188W4O	1	1	this album is incredible. i actually named my band 'decembers children'. top tracks 'get off my cloud', 'im free', 'as tears go by', 'move on', and 'when blue turns to grey'. followed by all the cool bonus tracks, from their television performances. buy it!!
A1B2TOKZ188W4O	1	1	what a fantastic film. a perfect combination of the original hulk comics, (hulk smash) and the television show we all know and love. great fun, for the entire family!! buy it!!
A1B2TOKZ188W4O	1	1	although we enjoyed santa clause 2 and 3 the original is still the shining jewel in this ongoing Christmas franchise!!
A1B2W0GUIXEMJX	1	1	some scumbag tried to steal my moped, and this lock held up. I had it chained to my back porch, looks like the scumbag(s) tried to cut it with bolt-cutters or similar (you can see the scuffing on the fabric cover) and couldn't get through, so all they could steal was my bike cover. If I'd been using a regular bike lock, I am sure I'd no longer have a bike.
A1B2W0GUIXEMJX	1	1	I really wish I could find these available again! They are large and elegant, the perfect wineglasses! My set has suffered a couple losses (they are fragile) but they're so pretty I'd keep buying more. They are large and tall- 10-12" or so.
A1B2W0GUIXEMJX	1	1	The price meant I asked myself over and over if this was something I really NEEDED, or if I wanted to drop so much money on a pan when I had a perfectly serviceable aluminum roaster, but I did. And I'm SO glad I did. It's been a couple years and it just keeps getting better. I'll use this thing the rest of my life. If you're on the fence about this, treat yourself. This is seriously one of the nicest pieces of kitchen equipment I have ever used. It's hauled out at least once a week for roast chicken, short ribs, braised pork belly, tagines- anything you can think of.
A1B38LWWNE3DS9	0	0	The fact that the body remembers the psychological injuries inflicted on the mind is not new. What I found very disappointing and almost incredible is the fact that the author draws up a list of possible abuses and puts at the same level the trauma of a painful surgery and the emotional or/and sexual abuse of a child mistreated by her parents for years. The book is simplistic and first of all sends the wrong message to people who carries deep emotional wounds. It is close to the superficial self-help books that claim that they can solve your problems once and for all. This must be untrue given the huge number of books of this kind, all of them promising what they do not deliver. And the reader who needs serious help keeps buying the latest "secret" book that holds all the answers to your problems.
A1B38LWWNE3DS9	1	1	Professor Storey has composed a profound, deeply spiritual collection ofprayers for gay men and women. This is a precious book to buy for our friends and share it with them. I highly recommend it. Many of the prayers in this book are for all those men and women (not only in the gay, bi, and transgender community) who feel in exile in our contemporary society. These prayers are heartfelt and have a profound healing message.
A1B38LWWNE3DS9	1	1	The Embalmer is a masterpiece. Matteo Garrone is the best new director coming from Europe. A former director of photography, he makes movies that are unforgettable, both from a visual and a narrative point of view. Highly recommended.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	Yuk. Over-the-top gore, gratuitous nudity, Verhoeven-flavored Leftist politics, typical Hollywierd corruption. Kind of "Aliens" meets "The Puppet Masters" (and I mean the movie, not Heinlein's book).Forget this one. A tedious, pointless mess.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Post-2004 USA elections, one could classify this a "Red" book. But really the only critics who see therein crypto-fascism, totalitarianism, bla bla bla are the Leftist, liberal-progressive, "Ain't a-gonna study war no more" types. Like Verhoeven and the Hollywierd producers that corrupted Heinlein's message in the movie adaptation.Heinlein describes exactly what the welfare-state One-Worlders have been trying so hard to do to the West for the past three generations. He no doubt was laughing grimly in the grave after 9/11, muttering "I told you so." That any illegal alien can sneak into the USA and get a drivers' license or vote is another example of the craziness which he campaigned against.One of Heinlein's core messages is that citizenship and its attendant rights should belong to those who defend one's civilization, indeed one's very species. Cowards and pacifists need not apply -- they can just go pick up their dole check. But vote? Forget it.If you read no other Heinlein (betcha can't read just one!), make sure it's this one.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	This film is a classic Hollywood-adaptation abomination from start to finish. Not one shred of Heinlein's message is left unsmeared or uncorrupted: substituting Nazi-esque Fascism for warrior honor and defense of humanity, wimpy Star Wars-infantry helmets for high-tech full battle armor, sleazy sex scenes and cheap shots for ... well, I don't recall any in the book.There is surely an eighth circle of hell reserved for directors like Verhoeven, who harks from the Netherlands, noted for its Leftist sociopolitics. Ah, but see where it got them; just ask Theo Van Gogh.Forget it and read the original novel. It should never have been touched by Hollywierd.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	(*****) for the Japanese-language track on this long-awaited Region 1 release of Kaze no Tane no Naushika on DVD. Compared to grey- and black-market DVDs and VHSs to which Miyazaki fans have had to resort, this new DVD mastering and cleanup with remastered Hisaishi soundtrack is like a newly-polished gem. Bravo, and about time!( **1/2) for this boo-hiss Disney-fied English-track mess foisted on North Americans! Judging by the mangled pronunciations, soundtrack "enhancements", dramatic-element telegraphing and noticeable character & plot alterations, we-all Yanks must be too stupid to understand what Miyazaki-san originally had in mind. Or maybe, like other Disney repackagings, somebody really, totally missed the point and just doesn't "get" the original story and presentation.Bizarre changes abound:-Since when did Ohmu become "Ohm"?-The God Warrior has been renamed "Giant Warrior" -- why, so deists & theists wouldn't be offended?-Why oh why is the city-state of Pejitei (peh-jee-tay) pronounced pedge-ite?-Why is Nausica&auml; voiced by an actress with a vocal palette of sobs, anger, and monotone?-Why was Yupa to choose the name of a child without first being asked to be her godfather?Extra soundtrack compositions intrude constantly, spoiling the dramatic feel of what were tender or sad/dramatic moments. Evidently nature abhores a vacuum; so do obtuse soundtrack directors.Insufficient voice talent coaching and direction (except for Patrick Stewart), questionable translations, elective plot surgery and gratuitous tinkering-by-focus group have made this an annoying, shameful product. Not as bad as "Warriors of the Wind", maybe, but in the same spirit, if not extent.I can recommend this to anyone over about ten years old. The themes are mostly adult, and the situations of extreme violence, threat, death and loss are pretty intense. Despite the Disney veneer and American kid-vid standards, this is just not for the kiddies.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	(*****) for the Japanese-language track on this long-awaited Region 1 release of Kurenai no buta on DVD. Compared to grey- and black-market DVDs and VHSs to which Miyazaki fans have had to resort, this new DVD mastering and cleanup with remastered soundtrack is wonderful. Bravo, well done!( ****) for this Disney-fied English-track leg-lift aimed at North Americans! Judging by soundtrack "enhancements", dramatic-element telegraphing and noticeable character & plot alterations, we-all Yanks must be too stupid to understand what Miyazaki-san originally had in mind. And apparently only name-brand vocal stars will get us into theaters.While the English track of this DVD fares much better than Disney's recent release of Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind, there are still bones to pick. Why does the Pig (well-voiced here by Michael Keaton) no longer threaten (bluff) to kill all the air pirates when they're holding some kids hostage? Why does the Pig demand that these seven-year old girls (who now belong to a swim "club" instead of a swim team), wet but sunning themselves in their underwear after escaping from their captors, put their clothes back on? And why did they make Madame Gina (normally calm, supremely self-assured and patient) relatively temperamental, insecure, and girlish?One inexcusable point: the lovely French song Gina sings early on was rerecorded and rearranged, evidently by a poor excuse for a Las Vegas lounge singer, dripping with distasteful American-style sloppy emoting. A nasty change, and unwarranted.Questionable translations, plot surgery and gratuitous tinkering-by-focus group have made some elements a bit of a concern for Miyazaki purists, but thankfully the story's mostly unchanged. I still hate when Disney sneaks in "fill-in" dialog when characters' backs are turned. Why can't a longing gaze at the sunset remain just that?I can recommend this to anyone over about eight years old. The themes are mostly adult, and there are situations of threat, suspense, lots of gunfire, and slapstick violence. Not for small children, but then again not as intense as Princess Mononoke or Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Warner's first book, in what was to become a series, was a standard in 1960's US elementary school reading. It combines the elements of adventure, a bit of fairy-tale, and children's budding self-reliance and resourcefulness to make an engaging story. Our 7-yo found it delightful, if a bit below her reading and vocabulary level.The artwork inside the book is first-class; less so the stilted, "modernized" cover art of this and sundry other editions.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	Not very entertaining. Slow-paced, stereotyped female characters, a purely-evil antagonist with no reason to exist, unevolving personalities, irrelevant plot digressions, endless nasty and pointless dialog.Frau Funke's German-to-English translator evidently missed the distinction between Elves and Fairies - quite clear in the British tradition, but lost here because the German "Elfen" can refer to either. She simply takes whatever magical creature she's heard of and assigns to them whatever attributes strikes her fancy.A good editor would have cut this huge volume down by 30-50%. During storytime I cut out the dross just to hasten making an end. Dreary and tiresome by the end.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	This is definitely not a politically correct story. It's all the rage these days to "expose" moral & religious agendas, but Christian fundamentalists, New-Age spiritualists, radical feminists, cultural relativists, and anti-religionists might broaden their outlook by exposure to The Secret Garden.But I cannot fault the storytelling or illustrations of this classic. It is mildly puzzling in that the storyline starts out with a journey of self-discovery and personal improvement for the orphan girl Mary, but gradually pushes her to the side as Master Colin undergoes his own salvation. So it's hard to say whether this is a "girl's book" or a "boy's book" -- it's not both at once except briefly at the crossover from emphasis from Mary to Colin.Cultural nonjudgementalists will be irritated at the portrayal of Yorkshire life, speech and peasantry. But I think it's important for young readers to understand not only aspects of the historical Yorkshire culture itself, but also how it was sentimentalized by the English class structure.Mostly harmless -- good for storytime and middle readers.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Our whole family enjoys this movie tremendously. The language can occasionally border on the coarse, and the Bad Guys can be intense. So, keep out of reach of the under-8 set.Captures the essence of an alternate-universe Star Trek (original series); deals sensitively with the realpolitik of fan conventions, insufferable egos, and disillusioned acting careers.The Thermians are quite funny. A well-done movie!
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	While aimed at the "tween" 9-12 year girl set, there are sufficiently disturbing elements and sprawling unoriginality in the Lily Quench series to recommend a pass.1) The main antagonist is a scheming torturess. No descriptions of torture are made, but the threat is constant. This caused real conflict in our family, as I was put on the spot trying not to explain to an 9-year old what an Iron Maiden is.2) The males are either retiring, passive nerds, or raging-male figures -- hardly a wholesome palette from which to form positive opinions of boys and men.3) Bald-faced ripoffs from the Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings crop up quite often. "Derivative" is putting it mildly.I imagine the author fancies herself Roald Dahl's literary heir. Whereas Dahl's works are often entertaining-subversive, Ms. Prior's stuff is merely tiresome-perverse.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Very effective in reducing background rumble for in-city listening. Better than some other noise-canceling 'phones in that one can still listen to the source material when the NC unit is off or its battery (2x standard AA-cells) is depleted. Also, no proprietary, non-replaceable battery.Low-frequency rumble of auto road noise is reduced to a slight whispering. Even the brappa-brapp of Harleys is reduced. Wind noise is tolerable up to moderate breezes.Biggest gripe is the noise-canceling module "line lump", which is rather heavy and has two cables coming out one end. Not convenient for belt-mounting by taller users, too heavy for the breast-pocket of shirts or jackets.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	First-rate coverage of the whys & wherefores of raising iguanas, especially the Green Iguana. It would be a good idea to read the first few chapters before buying to get a feel for the Iguana "lifestyle".
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	Cable works fine with official Nokia PC Suite software.This vendor shipped the cable with a suspicious, unlabeled DVD-R of software installers of unknown provenance. Turned this disk into coaster, used Nokia suite instead.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Quite liked it, could relate to the author as a fellow ex-progressive.Demonstrates clearly the fascist roots of today's "progressives"; the whitewash, lies and coverups indulged in by today's Left about the radically racist-eugenicist-socialist origins of the Left's heroes.Explains the semantic subterfuge and linguistic drift that maps Classic Liberalism into today's Conservatism, and fascist-socialist-pragmatist utopianism into today's Liberalism.Finally, the author illustrates the widespread, boiled-frog intrusion of fascist structures into the formerly Classic Liberal and Libertarian context of America. Demonstrates clearly that both Left and Right in 21st Century America consequently feel unconstrained and pragmatic about using fascist structures to impose liberty-destroying regulations... with a happy face and for our own good, of course.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	Unfortunately the Tanzquartett Wien chose to pursue the "interpretive" route in performance. The result is a sloppy, easy-listening style which exemplifies the Italian peculiarity of Tempo rubato (stolen time).For elevator or cafe music, I suppose one could do worse. For actual ballroom music in true Vienna period style, to which one could actually dance waltzes, forget it.Try instead the excellent performances by the late Willi Boskovsky and his ensemble. Sadly, many of these are not in current issue. The used/collector's aftermarket within this retailer are a good source from which I have obtained CDs of many of Boskovsky's works.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	I dunno what the complainers are griping about. When installed and adjusted properly, the insert does exactly what it's supposed to do, namely minimizing tearout and stopping thin trimmings dropping down into the motor works.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	This "set", one disk among several empty cases, is a poorly-produced black market ripoff evidently scan-converted from a Region 2 DVD released in Europe. Somebody spliced in the N. Am. theme songs; that's the only diff.I've had it for a year or so, but already the DVD disk itself is starting to decompose, kicking out uncorrectable errors that cause blocky artifacts and playback freezes. What a nightmare!Disney's idiotic handling of the entire W.I.T.C.H. line has been terminally frustrating for N. Am. fans, leaving only second-best and arguably illicit avenues for watching this cool series.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	My first TSP572 unit developed a stress crack in the corner of the display; it was replaced under warranty.Longer-term, the temperature probe cable jacket started decomposing immediately, not only where a hot oven door closes upon it in use, but also where the cable joins the bent-tube probe tip.As a product design engineer, the probe-cable assembly is IMO poorly designed using unsuitable materials. Considering the replacement cost of just the probe is currently ~$8, about 1/4 the cost of a new unit, I don't believe I'd buy this product again or recommend it to others.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	I've found in working with Titebond III that it's very aggressive in tack. Even positioning unclamped workpieces will be a problem half a minute later if you have to adjust things. It self-shims a bit so clamps are a must. With tight-fitting joinery you get one chance to knock glued parts together.From its MSDS, Titebond III is a PVA polymer glue with 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol as a solvent/carrier, the latter being a Listed hazardous substance. As a solvent it passes readily through the skin, so despite what the brochure says, wearing gloves would definitely be prudent. I can attest that the drying glue leaves hands a wreck.The solvent is toxic to fish, so cleanup where rinsings can reach waterways would be poor eco-stewardship. And it is mildly inflammable, so no open flames!The PVA portion is a skin, eye, and lung irritant and should not be inhaled as sanding dust. Use full respiratory protection as you would with any glued workpieces.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Not a bad adaptation of a book, but, as with many flicks, reading the book first will help the movie make sense. The book's creepier and richer, but some of the movie's musical numbers are amusing and creative in their own way.The Wybie character might have been introduced to meet the PC/diversity compulsion of modern cinema. Wybie is a distraction, then an irritant, and finally his role destroys a major part of Coraline's character development present in the book.So I'd say, buy and read the book first, then view the movie.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	I've never had a PowerSun burn out, going on 3 years with my green iguana. I make minimal use of Ca/D3 supplements, and vet says no sign of MBD. Even tho no burnout, I change lamp annually to ensure UVB rated output.I follow lamp mfr's recommendations (mounted vertically in fixture with heavy-duty porcelain socket and good ventilation), and always let the lamp cool down 10 minutes before restarting--essential for long life with a mercury lamp. Also I never move lamp when powered.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	Foaming feature does not work when configured & used according to instructions. If you're looking for a small-scale foam dispenser, as I was, this is not the gadget for you.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	After 3 1/2 years of moderate use--scarcely heavy-duty-- something went "clunk" inside during a shred-a-thon. Internal motor still turned on with papers in the slot, but no action in the metal shredding head.Opened up the case of the shredder works and found that a compound spur gear in the transmission/reducer had shattered. All the gears in the transmission are plastic, with metal gears only at the motor-coupling and shredder-head ends. No proper bearings on these cheap plastic gears, just sleeves and heavy greasing to manage friction. Over time & use the plastic became brittle and couldn't stand the load.It's regrettable that for the P-57Cs Fellowes elected to hit a price point and skimp on materials & engineering, whereas I and no doubt many buyers might gladly pay another $20 retail for real metal gears and longer life. So an otherwise perfectly good shredder is unfixable and headed to the landfill, just because of a $0.25 hunk of cheap plastic. Maybe the Cs in "P-57Cs" stands for Cheap.. er, stuff.Also, beware of placing shredder by sunny windows or under skylights: bright light shining in the slot can "blind" the optical paper detector and cause the unit to turn on. We once returned after a day out and found the shredder hot & running continuously.Finally, cat owners beware: our new 8 month old cat found a way to jump into the shreddings bin, but was unable to get out. Was looking one day for lost kitty and spied a pair of eyes peeking out of the bin port. Block it with packing tape and UNPLUG the shredder between uses.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	I bought this as a replacement for my lost trustySony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), thinking, "Hey, it's a Sony, should be good." Hah.First thing, the volume control thumbwheel popped off the back when I unclipped it from my waistband. I only luckily retrieved it, but lost it 3x more until the last instance it was lost forever--so no more volume control except with tweezers.Second, each button push generates a very loud BEEP in the 'phones that cannot be turned down or disabled. This is absolute murder when using noise-canceling headphones, which makes the BEEP even louder.Third, the unit has all these fussy mode switches and functions that are useless for just listening. Hard to remember how set the time and change presets. Reception is okay but susceptible to being overpowered by local stations.Thank goodness I found & bought a newSony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), and I'm back in my Happy Place again.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	Implied claims of allergy improvement should be doubted, as evidence is wanting that Furminator works better than any other washing or grooming technique in eliminating dander and saliva dust.Furminator will indeed yank out a lot of fur--but I wonder whether it's inadvisable to do so in autumn, when for example longhaired cats are building up their winter coats. Might such cats with winter outside access get chilled?This is a coat-thinning tool, the use of which should be thought out carefully. It seems unsuitable for standard grooming or snarl/rat/tangle removal per se.The precision-machined toothed blade resembles the stator of a standard handheld electric clipper. Blade is very hard & sharp and could cause injury (to user or pet) if moved forcefully/suddenly around eyes, ears, and head or underbelly where there is little to no undercoat.Despite discounts the gadget still seems IMO overpriced.I always had the impression that Furminator was forcefully removing fur that would naturally have stayed attached, not so-called "dead" hair as some reviewers believe. So after a few uses I shelved the Furminator and went back to a standard plastic-tipped metal-bristle brush. I no longer fear hurting our flame-point ragdoll with a slip of the tool, and she rather enjoys and stands still for ordinary brushing-away of truly loose fur.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	0	The criminally incompetent ex-hippie "professors" Lappan, Fey, Fitzgerald, Susan, and Philips coauthored this abominable "Connected Mathematics" series, which needs a better name like "Math For Morons: If you don't suck at math now, you will when we're finished with you."Wretched, awful stuff. Real-world people who have to use math--scientists, engineers, CFOs--simply do not think in the muddled, confused way promoted by this series.Do not use this garbage; if you must, as all the miserable Seattle Public Schools middle schoolers--and their furious parents--have since 2007, then I sympathize, cos it's all I can do to not stick this dreck in the shredder after another dreary evening sitting with my kid puzzling over this cr*p. And more than one Seattle math teacher is angry over having to push this curriculum.Same goes for the rest of the Connected Mathematics series likeVariables and Patterns: Introducing Algebra (Connected Mathematics)etc. Just say no!Before your kid's brains leak out her ears from Connected Mathematics, order here the classic old-school Algebra textElementary Algebraby Hal Jacobs--really fine, and a needed antidote to CM garbage.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	0	We're using this book as an antidote to the abominable so-called Connected Mathematics (CMP). The problem is that CMP (used tragically here in Seattle public schools) takes up so much time that we have to do Jacobs in the morning before school. We may have to push real math into the summer months, more's the pity.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Update September 2012: our LR II still going strong. A few tips:1) every 2-3 months or so, dump the litter using the handy Empty cycle, rinse with some diluted bleach solution, and hose out or rinse in shower. Let drain, towel dry, open hatch manually and blow in air with a household fan till dry.2) use the best litter you can afford. After many trials, we foundEver Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 42 Pound Boxto be the best-performing for our two cats. Practically no odor if waste sack is changed daily or every second day. Just top up with an added fresh cup or two as needed, up to the fill line on the LR's rubber liner.Even with -- or maybe because of -- high-quality clumping litter, we go through a 25lb. box only every 5-6 weeks, maybe 1/3 the usage before we got the 'bot. The LR II has long since paid for itself in lower litter consumption, to say nothing about improved quality of life.++Pluses++----------* Huge reduction in litter consumption. Unlike some cranks who think the LR is "crazy expensive", we actually did the math: we figured for 2 cats, odd-day bag changes ($0.05/bag), 2-3x weekly topping up of litter in-machine, and total litter replacement every month, and current premium clumping litter pricing. Result is that the Litter Robot will have paid for itself in about a year.* Much less dreary work compared to stooping over a box 2-3 times/day cleaning out the nasties, inhaling possibly infectious dust. Check maybe daily to see whether machine is A-OK (see below).* Pretty quiet (but we do keep ours in downstairs 3/4 bathroom).* Thorough cleaning (back yard with hose, or in-shower) with washing-up soap and maybe weak bleach spray, needed only once per month depending on mess & use history.--Minuses-------------* Machine will stop its cleaning cycle at slightest provocation, especially if the sensitivity knob is not adjusted properly. After retrying with a persistently curious cat the LR can just go brain-dead, get flummoxed, and need to be power-cycled to resume normal operation. Bad news if cats really have to go.* "Green" waste bags supplied by Litter Robot are costly and too large. Shop around for cheap pail liners and save a bundle.* Younger/lighter cats may not trigger the tilt switch to start the cycle timer. This can lead to waste buildup and require manual triggering of cleaning cycle. If a cat jumps in and out (observed) without using the outside pedestal, the unit often will not self-clean at all.* Water wash of sphere requires a good toweling-out and an hour of fan-assisted draining/drying to be ready for refilling; have to finesse cleaning times with urgent cat needs.* The activated-carbon mesh pad stuck inside the waste drawer intended to absorb/lessen odors -- doesn't work. The nose test still rules.That said, WE LOVE OUR LITTER ROBOT! and would not willingly go back to the old poop scoop. Feels like we got our life back; we certainly have reduced our expenses.NB Anybody who follows the recommended transition protocol should have no problem with curious cats disrupting the cycling mechanism; even our cats who are quite accustomed to the LR's operation will sometimes put it into a halt state (just cycle the power). Likewise, actually reading the manual (RTFM!) has been known to help.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	0	Skip those gritty youtube downloads, and never mind the incoherent amateur criticisms about Rhino's handling of the material. If there be missing material, thank corporate lawyers, not Rhino's production staff.That said, the DVD's menu structure is indeed poorly mastered--there's unpredictable/irritating behavior in menu navigation that should have been caught in vetting, and which any moron with even DVD Architect could have avoided.But let all that pass--the material makes the medium's shortcomings insignificant. So if you ignored DEVO in their ascendency during the mid-70s thru mid-80's, your atonement would be to snag a copy of this DVD to get started, then get the associated CDs which really let the music shine.NB Weird Al's parody "Dare To Be Stupid" is an hysterical collage-sendup of DEVO's early music & videos--but it has impact only if you've seen the real thing.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	Orchestration and performance introductory notes in Russian, German, and English, with Russian and French notations (in addition to the usual Italian notations) on the score itself, plus occasional English margin translations.That said, there are some issues:1) This is not a new edition, but a scan from quite old engraving prints. There is a general lack of crispness, and a grittiness to lines, text that is a bit fatiguing. Digital cleanup of pages is inconsistent, with some pages looking pretty good, others where all features are thickened and dark, and at least one page thinned and spotty.2) Inconsistency: The French score section headings are translated into English and placed on the bottom margin, whereas the Russian score note translations are put into the introductory section before the score.3) Poor translations occasionally pop up: e.g. when discussing "Entre&eacute; des parents en incroyables", the term incroyables is translated as dandies or fops. This is incorrect. A brief Parisian fashion fad in post-Bastille France after about 1792, the Incroyables and Merveilleuses were young men and women flamboyantly rebelling against the stuffy courtly manners and decadent clothing fashions of their parents. The parents have arrived in fun costumes of their grandparents' generation.4) I should very much have liked to see the score portion for Act II, 12. Divertissement: d. Gigue (English Dance) orchestration by noted ballet conductor John Lanchbery. Though not 100% authentic Tchaikovsky (but evidently drawn from his notes), it would be nice to have, given that at least one "Complete Score" recorded album includes a performance of the Gigue.5) The pages are hard to grip and turn.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	0	1	I expected more from the animators who did the Coraline adaptation, but then the story/script this time was not taken from a fine, dark Neil Gaiman story.Brilliant technical achievement in the animation, but everything else is recycled clich&eacute;s: The Sixth Sense, Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead/generic zombie flicks, car chases, grade-school bromance, even a dash of Beetlejuice.The action is s-l-o-w, the story meandering and full of dated pop-culture references, characters somewhat grotesque (not just the zombies) and confined to narrow stereotypes, and the PC/GA burden heavy-handed and tedious.Unlike the Coraline movie, I would not view ParaNorman again nor recommend it to others.
A1B38S1YJR1PQD	1	1	What's weird is that the spooky and unaccountable MPAA had slapped an "R" rating ("brief language, smoking, and rude behavior") on this movie when the DVD was mastered. Not cited are the far worse depictions of cats being kicked, hit with a bottle, and shot at, and of a child being struck by the main Bad Guy. Strangely however, the current rating online and on the DVD carton is "PG".For those parents who actually care to guide their children, and engage in a little perspective-building dialog after a family viewing, this is a fine, harmless movie. The Bad Guy gets his comeuppance, community standards of moral behavior are demonstrated, and the protagonists reach a satisfactory conclusion. Miss Minoes is free of the usual creepy and politically-correct subtexts that permeate most American-made kids' films these days.BTW the original Dutch dialog track is to be recommended.
A1B3FP2V53ZAU6	1	1	Quiet and smaller sized. I like the UV Germicidal light option and the air quality meter is an added bonus. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because my room can sometimes get a musty smell (Pacifica, very foggy and houses mildew easily) and it doesn't clear out the smell all the time.
A1B3FP2V53ZAU6	1	1	I have curly hair, just at my bangs. :( So every morning I have to do my due diligence and blow dry those errant hairs straight. I've used many different mousse products.. some are too sticky, some flake off, some just don't work at all. Then I found Phomollient. This is the best product Aveda makes, in my opinion. Natural, smells great, and does it's job well. I wish I had a lifetime supply.
A1B3FP2V53ZAU6	1	1	These candies are crazy addictive. I had to limit myself to one of each flavor a day because I was finding I couldn't stop after 1. After a while, I stopped following the restriction I posed upon myself and had to have my boyfriend place it up on the top shelf where my 5'2" self couldn't reach it. Unfortunately in a weak state of mind I climbed my kitchen counter and ate more candies to my hard-working heart's content. Did I mention I have a very strong sweet tooth? These are very very good.
A1B3FP2V53ZAU6	1	1	I love the look of this toaster.. it really is one of the nicest looking appliances I have in my kitchen. I really don't hold toasters up to high standards, so I am giving this toaster a 5. It does it job fine, it sits and looks pretty. That's all I can ask for in a toaster.
A1B3FP2V53ZAU6	0	1	Like others, I had problems with the inner seam becoming almost razorlike during the night when I was trying to sleep, and digging into my shoulders. It is impossible to get comfortable..I've used the pillow for about a week and the adjustment period is long. Normally I'm a back sleeper, and there is no way to sleep even tilted on your back with this pillow because there is so much stuffing, your neck will ache in the morning. Even side sleeping kinks your neck because of the height. I thought it would get better, but a week later and it hasn't, and it is going to be returned. Almost every night I've started out sleeping with the pillow and in the middle of the night I get so uncomfortable I switch to my memory foam contoured pillow.The pillow itself is not very cool either.. and with the southern California summer coming on, the past few nights I've gotten so hot and uncomfortable sleeping in the middle of the pillow (without covers) that I switch over to my other normal pillow.I think I may try the Costco body pillow next to see if that will help.
A1B3GP6BU4ZA3X	1	1	I love this! I love both the 2nd and 3rd tri videos! Brin can be kind of corny sometimes but what workout video isn't these days? And its funny not annoying! This is not a HARD HARD workout but I am to tired and run down after doing everything else in the day to work out hard. I do this video and did the 2nd trimester one 2xs a week and the yoga sessions at least once a week and walked very other day. My weight is perfect on track! I do watch what I eat but I still have ice cream a few times a week! I am 32 weeks and today my midwife called me thin (in a good way!!!). I am not the thin type I can look at a bagel and gain 3 lbs I have always been like that! To maintain 135lb at 5'2'' before preggo I had to exercise 2 hours a day HARD so I am thrilled with this! I just wish I had started the first trimester with her 1st video! I will also use her videos post-partum! She gives helpful and encouraging info during the workout as well. I tried other preggo workouts and just did not like them. They were to long or did things my Dr. said were big no nos during pregnancy. I have diastisis recti and Brin's videos give you an option for how to do workouts if that is something you have. LOVE IT!
A1B3GP6BU4ZA3X	1	1	We love this dresser/combo changing table. We have yet to use it for baby since baby isn't here yet but so far so good. It did take about 2 hours to put together but was not hard at all. I read through the reviews about how much trouble people had putting it together and I do not understand. My husband is very much "handy man" inclined and had no trouble. The directions were only pictures. He laid out all the parts before hand so he knew everything was there and where to find what he needed. The only negative was when he put the back pieces on some of the screws did split the wood a little on the inside. But very minor and you cannot see it. We also went to Lowes and bought "nifty nobs" and put those on instead so the handles are animals and fun kid things and it looks great! There is also a surprising amount of room inside for storage. It is a little tall for me but will work fine (I am 5'2'')
A1B3GP6BU4ZA3X	0	0	To me this book is terrible! I consider myself a "traditional" wife. I sew, cook, clean, etc and my husband works outside of the home but this book was not for me! I am a Christian but how I made my curtains is not something my mother comes over to check if I did correctly! And if I messed them up that does not make me a bad wife! And what does that have to do with childbirth? This was more of a story than info on natural childbirth. I do not recommend this book. I know some who like it but for me it was not helpful at all. I wish I could give it no stars!
A1B3VGP2DG0N78	0	0	Like so many of the faithful RJ fans, I eagerly awaited the release of COT, the 10th book in the series and had done reading it within 2 days of purchase. If I had to say one word to rate it - Disappointing!!!. Yes, in contrast to the last few books, he does deal with all the lead characters but as some reviewers have put down - there is no advancement in plot. In the published interview, RJ has said he hopes to finish this series in 2 more books - I just cannot see how that can happen without been a disappointment. But like so many others, I will keep waiting for the next one....
A1B41PPQAO4ZP	1	1	I loved this book. The characters in it are bizarre but still mostly believable. I think she did a great job at keeping them up and it's somewhat sickening to know that people like this exist, which makes you want to read on.I will agree with other critics, however, in a few ways. The ending was not the greatest. It kind of felt like she was tired of writing and kind of slapped on the easiest finish. The majority of the book, however, kept me wanting more. She did not shy away from shocking situations.Second, the characters do sometimes falter in personality which I alluded to before (especially the mother), but I think that it's also somewhat practical, especially since the situations in this book were extreme. Overall I don't think it takes away.Third, it is ridiculous that so many of these things could happen to one girl. But seeing such a tough personality grow was exciting and each of the situations were well written.I would not hesistate recommending this book to anyone. It is different from a lot of things you will pick up which was very refreshing.
A1B41PPQAO4ZP	1	0	Most things about this book are not new to anyone. We all know that the industry is full of twisted people who just want the most money that they can get and will say anything and hurt other people. Well, lots of business is like that. But that's besides the point. If you're looking for hard facts and statistics, look elsewhere. Not the book for you.It was, however, an entertaining read. You won't enjoy this if you are too serious a person because it is somewhat ridiculous, in an unfortunately truthful way.I suppose it would be good to know that I am not a smoker. I actually have very adverse reactions to cigarette smoke, so I would say that creates some bias. And I also strongly dislike big business.For me this was an easy, enjoyable read.
A1B42DQODIQJSQ	1	1	Funny, people either love or hate this album. If you like aggressive rap you'll be among those loving it.If you like Fat Joe and Scarface you'll have to buy it just for the track "Never liked yo ass". Two incredible rappers united on one of the best tracks they ever produced on a dope beat.The list of appearances on this album speaks for itself. Other compilations have tought us that great rappers can make weak tracks too, but you'll mostly find good stuff on this one.This is the type of album with an underground feel that i've been desperately seeking these days. Not enough albums like this being produced.

Thank you Mrs. Holzschlag but i already have these colors on my computer, no need for you to sell them to me in a book. They'll look different on my screen anyway than on paper.What i want is color psychology, color associations, how to best combine different colors (beyond just naming the typical color schemes - color scheme generator 2 could automatically create that type of generic scheme) , things to consider on the screen other than "use browser-safe colors". These topics are hardly covered in this book. Maybe mentioned, but that's about it.
A1B42DQODIQJSQ	1	1	One of the best books on software that i ever bought. I've been working with GoLive for quite a while now and just can't believe how many useful things i didn't know about it yet. So many shortcuts that enhance productivity, so many features that i paid too little attention to.Because of the way it's written - 200 tips, most of them on 1 or 2 pages - it's easy to pick it up at any time, read a minute, learn something valuable and put it down again. And you're almost sure to learn something new with every tip.
A1B42DQODIQJSQ	0	0	So, i know a little about CSS, i want to get better, i get this book.Unlike what i expected, this book is more about design than about CSS. You'll find a few pieces of valuable information on CSS, but i know they're holding back a lot of knowledge here. It could go much deeper, and i think it should. Everytime it starts getting interesting it says: to find out more about this please visit the website at http://www.soando...I don't want to read all this on screen. I hate reading on screen. That's why i got this book after all. And i don't want to have to turn on the computer everytime i want to know more.Now, books on design in general are a good thing too. But unfortunately i feel that this book doesn't do a good job here.
A1B42DQODIQJSQ	0	1	"Extreme Photoshop CS" is a mix of all kinds of tutorials for designers and illustrators using photoshop.It is divided into three parts:1: realism2: cartooning3: advanced illustration techniques4: retro and vintage artThere are 12 chapters alltogetherTHE REALISM SECTION:The fishbowl chapter is the best of the realism section. It doesn't look super real but it's a nice illustration.The "text on fire" is awful and doesn't look real at all. Doesn't look good in any way.The i-pod ... well, how easy is that? basically a rectangle with some gradients, round corners here and there and that's it. Not impressed.CARTOONING AND PHOTOSHOPThe pixel art chapter was okay but it's all too easy, too self-explanatory. Actually just a certain range of angles and no anti-aliasing. I was able to guess that on my own.The emoticon: create an ugly face with some circles and squared rectangles. Kindergarten-level.cartooning and comic book art: i've seen much better tutorials on that. Some online, but also lots in the book "Japanese Comickers - draw anime and manga like japan's hottest artists". I'd recommend that book instead if you plan to colorize your comics in Photoshop.ADVANCED ILLUSTRATIONsilhouette illustration: trace a person with the path-tool. duh! It was nice to see how a very amateurish looking photo got converted into a very professional looking illustration though.wireframe illustration: trace a photo with the path-tool, leave it unfilled and stroke the path. Err... do we really need a tutorial for that?stylizing photographs: cutout-filter and lens flares ... are they serious??? Also learn how to trace the face of a nice woman to turn it into something more ugly.RETRO AND VINTAGE ARTnot even worth mentioningIf you are a beginner then maybe this book is for you. If you are an intermediate or advanced Photoshop user then you won't be very happy with it though.
A1B42DQODIQJSQ	1	1	there are hundreds of books on Photoshop but none that have been made specifically for VFX Artists. Except this one.VFX Artists means those that create the materials and do the mapping for 3D objects as well as Matte Painters.Although targeted for the intermediate to advanced user you don't have to know much about photoshop to read this book. Lopsie invests the first 92 pages to explain all the basics and make sure that everybody will be able to follow the following chapters.Part two is all about textures. She introduces her own version of a UV-testing checkerboard which is (as her example clearly shows) better suited for checking the correct alignment of all UVs than the standard black-and-white checkerboard often used for mapping-tests.She also explains how to create your own tileable textures from any photo, even when the tiles on the photo have been shot in a non-orthographic angle.She shows how to create custum brushes for dirt maps, create actions and lots more.Part three is about matte paintings. Having read that Lopsie Schwartz has been doing work for "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers", "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", and "Hollow Man" i thought that this chapter would be filled with inspiring examples of fantastic matte paintings, fantasy landscapes and so on. Well, it's not. But that's okay. If i just wanted inspiration and examples i could have ordered "the invisible art" by by Mark Cotta Vaz and Craig Barron. What she does instead might be less stunning but more valuable: she shows how to handle common tasks and problems. Such as removing unwanted elements in a photo, how to sharpen images using the highpass filter, reduce the noise, extract portions of an image, change the color of objects and scenes, merge two photos into one, change a daylight scene into a night scene (pictures on the front cover show before and after) and the list goes on ...Lopsie Schwartz has a very nice way of writing and explaining things. She also has humour. Reading the book is a joy.The book is all in color. Pictures for the exercises can be downloaded from the publisher's website.Summary:Adobe Photoshop for VFX Artist is a great book and covers a topic that has been left out so far, even though there are already so many books on Photoshop. It might not cover everything you need to know but i believe it's the best way for you to get started.
A1B47L4LKVO9RC	0	1	I can hear some really good sax from the yellowjackets, and this one just seems kind of slow. It sounds like a lot of keyboard sampling and easy Kenny-G'ish tones, very pop. I have had a chance to listen to other Yellowjackets releases though, and they put this one to shame. Thumbs on your own octave keys people.
A1B47L4LKVO9RC	0	1	First of all, for those of you calling Slayer "Thrash," that seems a bit off. Slayer is more like Death metal without the low Death voice. For those saying Araya can't sing, you are crazy. He's got one of the best voices in metal. For all of you calling this one of Slayer's best, you don't really like Slayer. I have only heard Show No Mercy, Reign In Blood, the title track and maybe 1 or more songs from South of heaven, Diobolicus Musica, this one, Divine Intervention, I think I've heard hel Awaits, Undisputed Attitude, I think that's all of them. Seasons was the first one I ever bought. It scared me to listen to it because I wasn't too sure about delving into something with such cover art, and Dead Skin Mask was scaaary. So I listened for a while, knowing I'd heard some of their earlier stuff and not being able to handle listening all the way through because it was so evil. I must say that is why I enjoyed this album at the time, because it was a mellower Slayer, and I could listen all the way through without feeling like I was going to be sacrificed at a Satanic ritual. So I though I'd buy the next one too, Divine Intervention, and the more I listend to DI, the more I couldn't stop listening, and the less Seasons appealed to me. Now i can listen to all Slayer and Seasons is my least favorite, but I still like to make mix tapes and include songs from Seasons, like for example it mixes really well with White Zombie's La Sexorcisto Devil Music Vol. 1 cd.Band I would call thrash would be Exodus, Anthrax, Overkill, maybe the original lineup and Kill'em All Metallica.
A1B47L4LKVO9RC	1	0	I honestly disliked most Megadeth albums after RIP as "thrash". CTE was good but kinda too slow and kinda pop. Everything after CTE was either not enough defining as anything but trying to continue from CTE with more songs, which got old like less than halfway through Youthanasia, or they were just altogether bad. This one is different, every song is left reverberating through your head even after it's over, the album never gets boring. I don't think this one would have sounded good faster, it's good at the speed it is, and a good buy even if you're not a Megadeth superfan.
A1B4DN9807HLZQ	0	0	I seldom write bad reviews here because I am usually careful to buy only items that are of high quality. This piece of junk is not high quality at all. *When* it was working, it had 1980's quality graphics and sound. I find it amazing that in this day and age Fisher-Price would dare to sell something of such low graphic quality-- especially to children who are now being brought up on HD displays, XBOXes, and ipads. As far as its functioning goes, I have seldom seen a more bug-ridden interface, which barely keeps up with the child as they try to interact with what is on the screen-- and sometimes it does not interact at all.The software is simplistic and sad and all the clunky games look very much alike with only the characters changing. The Hot Wheels and Thomas games are almost interchangeable in terms of activity and functionality. Also, the software has no memory between sessions so the child must start at the beginning each time--when it is working!The cycle sucked down batteries like a fiend! All FOUR batteries had to be replaced regularly-- FOUR?! My adult and full-size exercise bike takes four D-cells and that lasts for a month with regular use! What kind of a power-sucking computer processor did they put in this lousy thing? It does not help that it has no automatic shut-off. Remember this is for children who seldom remember to turn anything off! Finally, the cycle HAS NO DURABILITY! It "died" in a matter of two months under *very* light use from my children. This was a complete waste of money!
A1B4DN9807HLZQ	1	1	Great movie adaptation of the book a Princess of Mars! Fun, exciting, endlessly beautiful and fascinating! I recommend it for the whole family!
A1B4DN9807HLZQ	1	1	This are really great videos! It is a shame that no one out there wants to make them available so my kids can see them too!
A1B4DN9807HLZQ	0	0	Yes, there have been 7 movies made about Jean Shepherd's family before this, butEVERY one of those had Shep alive and narrating and making sure the story followedHIS vision. I have listened to hundreds of hours of Shep's radio shows and read hisstories and NONE look or sound like that trailer. The leg lamp never came backin any story I ever heard and though I remember Shep talking endlessly about hisfirst cars, I do not ever remember anything as silly happening as in that trailer.I worry greatly that this story is simply trying to make money off the legend ofShep and the original Christmas story. Seriously, Shep is legendary for his endlessstories over almost 20 years at WOR radio in NYC-- I can not believe that no onecould adapt some of those stories for an actual script based on his work. I willmake a final judgement on just how lousy this sequel is after I see it. In the meantime,I suggest you watch A Summer Story which is the actual sequel to the original move.
A1B4QA5G57427X	0	1	... - I gave this away after a month, although I had little previous yoga instruction. If you do this once or twice, you won't want to do it again. The length (only 20 min) is too short to provide a "power yoga" practice, and the segments are too disjointed to combine into one longer workout. I found Al's instruction to be inoffensive, but Lisa's tone of voice is annoying and condescending, and I've deliberately avoided the other Yoga Zone titles with her as the instructor.For someone who already has some familiarity with yoga looking for an introduction to power yoga, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms also available from Amazon. His practice is based on the classical Ashtanga style from which power yoga is derived, and it includes a beginning 30 min practice, a longer and more advanced 45 min practice, and a short 15 min practice along with a guided relaxation. His tape has plenty of room for growth, and it may prove to be a staple - it definitely has for me.
A1B4QA5G57427X	1	1	I absolutely love the first part of this workout, the 3-D Toning -- I feel so much longer and leaner by the end. Jennifer begins with some modern dancey warmups, moves into a tough ballet segment, and ends with some "power" yoga moves. All of the exercises challenge you to use and strengthen your core while building flexibility and balance. The 30 min fly by and despite its length, it's tough -- near the end of the workout Jennifer asks if you have a towel handy to wipe away the sweat, and the camera zooms in on her glistening face. (I love seeing instructors sweat!) I also appreciate that this is a cardio workout I can do without shoes. Although, as someone else has pointed out, her cueing isn't always great, she does consistently give reminders to keep the abs working and to breathe deeply; and after a few viewings the cueing won't be a problem.The companion workout, Core Conditioning is a bit of a letdown. After the explanations on form and breathing, the workout clocks in at only 15 min. The first few minutes were very similar to the core segment on Perfect Mix before she moves onto working the lower body, and I thought for a while that it was going to be the exact same workout. While I can't fault any of the exercises or her instruction, I feel that the workout should have been longer to truly compliment the 3-D toning segment. A good video that left me wanting more.
A1B4YBCOP4ZFJS	0	1	Other reviews relate this game to a really scary horror movie. I agree. This game scared the living weasel out of me more than any movie could.But when I go out to buy a game, I'm not really looking for something that's gonna scare me. I want a game that's fun. And SS2 just didn't cut it.Awkward play control (especially when fighting), lousy attempt at techno music, bad graphics. It's not enough RPG to be an RPG, and at the same time, not enough of an FPS to be an FPS.Bottom Line: You wanna be scared witless? Read a good book or watch a horror movie. Wanna have a lot of fun? Buy Unreal.
A1B4YBCOP4ZFJS	0	1	In short, this is why publishers hype games so early.&quot;Hey, I've got a great game idea! Let's make everyone else think it's great, so we can make a sorry excuse for a game and sell a zillion copies anyway!&quot;This game is fun for the first 2 hours. And if you beat the game, you know that's about .005% of it. After that, it's just the same old routine. Feed villagers. Give villagers wood. Put wood in workshop. Put scaffolds on ground. Give villagers more wood. Smack creature upside the head for doing something stupid that you've disciplined him for countless times. This goes on for hours and hours and hours.I'm not sure how anyone could think this degree of tedium would be fun. One could spend less money and run around in circles in his/her backyard all day.I'm currently trying to sell this game to a friend for $20. It's hard trying to say good things about a game that I hate so passionately to try to get someone else to buy it.In conclusion, I will never by another game just because of what I've heard about it. I've learned my lesson. I hope this will help others do the same.
A1B4YBCOP4ZFJS	1	1	The great songs on this CD are:Spybreak (Propellerheads) Clubbed to Death (Rob D) Leave You Far Behind (Lunatic Calm) Mindfields (Prodigy)Of course, Du Hast, Rock is Dead, and Wake Up are all pretty good the first few times you hear them.All the other songs are crap, though, sad to say...
A1B58SA5LY22VQ	1	1	This Journeyman Project game is the best yet. However, this may be due to the fact that we have made extreme advancements in technology.A 360-degree view let's you pan aorund your entire world. The scenery of past civilizations really is quite beutiful. Presto Studios did a wonderful job on the 3D portion of this game. This game allows the player to interact with other characters in the game. It allows you to choose from a choice of things to say. The extensive inventory allows you to carry several items at once from multiple time zones. The chameleon suit (added bonus!) allows the player to deiguise himself/herself as any character it meets. All of the guises are conviniently located at the bottom of the screen. This truly is a wonderful game!
A1B58SA5LY22VQ	1	1	This little DVD player is the best possible thing one could have. It fits perfectly anywhere you want it and fits into most overhead storage compartments. There are several things that make this an excellent buy though.First of all, the quality of the picture is outstounding. This is almost as good as HDTV (High Definition Television) because you have a crystal clear picture projected onto an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen. Secondly, when it is output to a TV, the picture is just as good as any other DVD player, but the bonus there is that this device is extremely small, comapred to those large and bulky DVD players (sure they cost less, but you can't take them on a seven hour flight from here to England.).There is also the controls and output. The controls on this DVD Player are quite easy to use. Without looking at the instruction manual, I was able to determain what a majority of the buttons did. The menus are quite accessible and manueverable due to a tiny &quot;joystick&quot; that allows you to swivel and pick your option. However, there are also output controls as well. The device uses fiber-optic cables which therefore means that it can be connected directly to a TV using the three wires (two sound, red and white, and video, yellow). When this is hooked up to a TV, the picture and sound quality is unbelievable.Then the ironic question must be asked &quot;why not just use my DVD player on the computer&quot;? Well, of course if you have a laptop the quality is fine, and of course, you can manage your budget while watching a movie, put there are some good things to having a DVD player as well. If your want to play a DVD movie for your family, wouldn't you rather have it on a TV screen than on a small LCD screen? Of course, if you're on an airplane and want to watch it there, you can't exactly display it on the TVs there. Thus, I can only say that one is not better than the other.In conclusion, I can only say that this DVD player is quite ideal because it is compact, picture-perfect, and can add whole lots of fun to your life.
A1B58SA5LY22VQ	1	1	This is an excellent episode! The way in which the episode was filmed keeps the watcher intrigued througout the entire show. In the opening segment, the camera, as it nears the beginning credits, the camera focuses in on the three main chairs of the bridge, introducing Commander McDuff, a &quot;new member&quot; of the crew. At first, this could have been any boring &quot;what happened?&quot; episode, but with the new character introduced, it sets up for a very perplexing situation.The crew slowly progresses . . . which usually equals a boring episode, but not in this case. Every so often there is a new twist to interest the watcher even more. Therefore, this episode never gives you a chance to turn it off, for something new and startling is always happening. Even a bit of a love twist!
A1B59UOKB5II2X	1	1	Great book for dreaming! Almost a little overwhelming, but definitely has some great ideas for where to go and what to see. It's organized by regions, states, countries, etc. so if you're planning a trip you can be sure and get all the sites on your itinerary. Great gift for newlyweds so they can start early making sure they see it all!
A1B59UOKB5II2X	1	1	The grip is wonderful. Being able to see it from the top is great. Lightweight yet seems very durable so far. Good buy!
A1B59UOKB5II2X	1	1	This seems to be a very quality product. Heavy duty, fits great, great quality for the price. I will probably buy more like it!
A1B59UOKB5II2X	1	1	Great Bible study book for small groups. Talks about the things we need to deal with where we live every day. Great Biblical basis and insights as usual for Kay Arthur.
A1B59UOKB5II2X	0	1	It is a cheap price and a fairly cheap violin. The pegs have a hard time staying in place even after trying their suggestions. The amp is so so. The bow is actually pretty good. The e string broke almost immediately even with a violin teacher tuning and trying to get it working right for her. Still working with it but overall pretty disappointing.
A1B59UOKB5II2X	1	1	A little too traditional storyline for most probably, but I love Golden Books still even at this age! Bought this for a baby shower-great tales for the next generation!
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	minus the capturing of Han Solo. The book starts off with Thrawn attacking a smuggler's base using AT-AT (not a snow planet like in Empire Strikes Back). The guy gets away of course, stuff happens and Luke finds his way to the Jedi Masters new home world to learn more about the ways of the Jedi. Sounds like Yoda right? Except this Jedi is really an evil Dark Jedi clone of a long dead good Jedi. The ending was pretty interesting too with them unmasking the Stormtroopers to find a surprise.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This takes place some 10 years after The Sith War. All the characters have changed, grown old, morphed (the tiger female looks way cooler) and grown up. Nomi Sunrider's daughter is a teenager now and wants to learn to be a Jedi. Ulic Qel-Droma is hiding on some ice world and wants to die. She seeks him out to learn the ways of the Jedi. The reason I took away a star was because how she found him. Some random guy (who looks exactly like the guys at the start of the original Star Wars) took Ulic to the snow planet and she just randomly picks a ship to stall on and guess who's ship it is? 10 billion people in the universe and she picks the guy who saw Ulic a day earlier. Wow, ironic, eh? There really is no bad guy in this story, it just shows Ulic teaching the girl. The closest thing to a bad guy has to be the good Jedi tiger girl, Silvar. Anyhoo its a good book to end the series with.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This was, if I recall, the first book (not including the God awful Dark Empire) in like 8 years written on Star Wars. Very well written, it takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi and an alien Grand Admiral has taken over the Empire. The book is very well written and has a strong feel of the movies without a sense of stealing from the movies. The only thing I found to be somewhat pitiful was this new Dark Jedi clone who was hiding on one of the Emperor's private planets guarding some huge secret. While this sets up for the huge climatic duel in the final book, I felt to be somewhat of poor authorship.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	And each time it gets better and better. This is, without a doubt, my favorite fictional book. E.V.E.R. There is some deeper sense that always gets me to return to this book. It is well written, and like I said to the first book in the series, does not borrow heavily on the films and when it does, in a good way. The ending, while somewhat predictable was also somewhat of a major plot twist that had your jaw drop to the floor as Mara Jade, the Emperor's top private assassin trained to use the Force and her final mission given to her by the Emperor to kill Skywalker, confronts Luuke Skywaler in a duel to the death.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	Being a fan of both Captain Marvel AND Alex Ross, I was at the comic store the day this came out knocking the door down to buy it. This is an excellent story of Captain Marvel as he visits a hospital for dying children and he struggles to realize that he can't save everyone. He meets a young boy who is abused by his father and after the wise old SHAZAM tells him that Marvel will meet someone in need of hope, he feels this boy is that someone. But is it?
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	I bought this a few years ago on Superbowl Sunday and read it cover to cover rather than watching the big game. This book is simply beautiful. The art is what gets people on this book. Painted by Alex Ross, each page (not just covers like in alot of comics). The story is great and the ending is priceless. My brother would envy Superman for what he got to do.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	Best. Artwork. E-V-E-R. This comic, in my opinion blows all other art away, even in other comics Ross has drawn. I originally bought this book FOR the art and I was so impressed I went out and bought as many of Alex Ross' books as I could get my hands on. The story is set in WW2 and the 1960s Marvel Universe, so you get to see some of the history of Marvel. It isn't a superhero book either but rather follows the life of a simple photographer in New York City and ends with one of the most famous Marvel stories ever.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	The story here is very impressive. It isn't so much a superhero story but rather a story of a love lost. The entire story is a flashback, and while the artwork, in my opinion would suck outside this story, fits the atmosphere of the story quite well.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This comic continues from Issue 4 or 5 (I can' recall, it was the Cracker Jack story) but you don't realize it until the end of the book. A young teenage orphan from a small community comes to Astro City to become famous. He gets a job as a bus boy in a private club that is frequently visited by super heroes. The boy then meets The Confesser, a Batman like super hero and the boy becomes his new side kick. The kid becomes the talk of the town as photos appear of him in the newspaper saying he is the Confessers side kick, but the Confesser never appears in the photos. However there is more to the Confesser than meets the eyes...
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	0	I originally bought this more on a gamble than nothing else. I had never read a single issue of Astro City and after reading this book I wash hooked. There is a much deeper feeling to this book than normal comics, probably because you don't HAVE a main character. Each issue you meet a new superhero (at first at least) and see what they are like. The first book introduces you to some of the main characters and sets up for The Confessor story line.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This book contains the first story arch of Astro City. In the previous issues, it was literally issue to issue, no to be continued endings, but this has it. The first arch shows the life of a 10 year old girl who is a super hero and struggles to cope with how she is different from normal girls. The second is of Jack In The Box (the dude on the cover) and how his pregnant wife will have a child who might grow up hating his father for dying when he meets 3 people from potential futures. 2 of which were homocidal maniacs claiming to be his son.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This story retells how Elektra and Daredevil met in college, but in an alternate universe (the Ultimate Universe). The book follows Elektra and Daredevil tends to be a secondary character in the story. I enjoyed it however and anticpated each following issue.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This comic, like Superman: Peace On Earth changed comics in a sense. The comic is HUGE and by huge I don't mean thick, but H-U-G-E. Batman is not full of gadgets and a fast car, but rather watered down to a man with some rope and a grappling hook as he fights crime in the ghettos of Gotham. He comes to terms with what he might have been after his parents were murdered when he meets a young boy who's parents were murdered in front of him. Batman realizes after his parents death he could have turned to a life of crime instead of crime fighting.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This story retells the origin of Daredevil starting with him as a normal kid. It really is not until the end we get to finally see Double D in his superhero costume. This story is violent and has some minor language but its the way, I think, Daredevil should be told.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	Its a great story, telling the tale of Gotham in the future. Well written, the art is very unusual and the writing style is different than other comics. ...
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	This is a difficult book to locate, and I managed to find a worn copy from the early 80s at a discount bookstore. The book covers basics, including of course, the history of CLF. There are 2 forms in the book, a Horse stance form, and a long range fighting form. It covers in detail different blocks, footwork and methods of attack, and application of the art. While by no means complete, it is a very detailed and written book covering alot of aspects of CLF. I reccommend this above the one written by Doc Fai Wong.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	0	0	My main qualm with this book is how the author claims he is simply expressing his opinion, and says that each person is entitled to his opinion, however he will then slam you in the face (figuratevly speaking, did I spell that right) that his opinions are right, and that it does not matter what others think. He never will flat out say it, but he will make it clear that he does not care about other people's opinions and that the only right person is himself.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	0	0	I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	0	As I write this, the book is listed within the top 25 selling books on Amazon. It has close to 1300 reviews. And it was written 4 years ago.My opinion will hardly change your mind.I read this after reading De Vinci, and I am glad too. Sure this takes place before De Vinci, but after the (very minor) let down of De Vinci when it came to the end, this book was the complete opposite. To the last chapter of the book, it had be stuck on it. I enjoyed this more than De Vinci, and with good reason. The book didn't get stuck on the same repeating themes that De Vinci did. This one was more entertaining, and, albeit a less believeable story, was just plain better. It isn't so much the story itself, but the way it was written. De Vinci's story was good, but it had too many repeated themes. This one was much more original as far as themes repeating, it didn't have some of the same lines over and over. So yeah, just like read it and stuff.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	I sat down to just glance through this book last Sunday at a used book store in my area and ended up buying the book after reading just one chapter on Bill O'Reilly. Definately the best part of the book. He lists his references in the book and at the end of the book, making it easily availble to locate (I've checked some out and they are legitimate). Yes, he might be a liberal, but the way he brings it, even a conservative should enjoy this book.And Bill O'Reilly is a blubbering (...).
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	And by complex I don't mean a deep thinking, analytical book. There are alot of pictures, drawings, charts, graphs, etc in here and if you don't know much about finance, you will be lost on occasion. It's a pretty decent read if you can find one for a good price.In regards to the person from April 28, 1999, if you can seriously and honestly say that PricewaterhouseCoopers "...Obviously, the authors' have no background in corporate finance..." then you need to keep away from any business books.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	Excellent book with many articles and opinions from top CEOs. These are some of the best business books out there, letting you see how the people who run these companies think. I don't know if the paperback has it or not, and honestly I would imagine given what happened it probably has been removed, but in the hardback version, the late Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron for the majority of years (except for 4 months when Jeff Skilling took over), writes his own little 8 page article on it. I don't know if the paperback has it or not, but I do know any hardback copy from 1998 would.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	0	0	There are over 300 reviews giving it 1 star, and 1,000 giving it 5 stars. Can that many people be wrong, or that many right? To put it bluntly, more people are wrong. If you want to read it, fine, read it, Get it from a discount book store, that way you are paying THEM and not the publisher or this man.This book is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. When finished, I felt motivated to "escape" the rat race, only to think "Where do I begin?" You can't take this advice and expect to come out on top. That is just stupid and unreal. The most you will get from this book is some fuel to go "Alright, time to think about my investments." Then thats about it.In all honesty the book started well. After about 100 pages I was wondering what was going on, why I wasn't getting advice. By the time I finished it, I was already walking towards the trash can.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	0	1	There are better books about him than this. While a lot of the stuff he says in the book is also in other books, it comes off twisted. And contradictive. One part of the book stands out in my mind in particular.He talks about how James Dimon and how he couldn't join the board at Citi Group. He says in the book something like "I told Jamie if he can convince the board to let him be a member then he should do so." A few pages later, maybe 2, he talks about how Dimon got onto the board after all and Weill felt betrayed he would go behind his back like that to convince the board to letting him join.That last paragraph sums up the book pretty much. Full of contradictions.
A1B5Q12S41M8VU	1	1	The only benefit this book really has is that it occasionally makes references to martial arts. The material in the book can be found in dozens other health/fitness books, with the exception of occasionally saying "since you do martial arts you may look into this more" which is something the other books overlook.A great book though by all means for those who do martial arts and I highly recommend it. However, if you have a lot of knowledge on health/fitness already, this book will provide little new information.

A1B5X7X3HENNJR	1	1	I play keyboard for small audiences from time-to-time and needed something easier to use than my old Shur mic. This unit does everything I need. I usually run it through a pre-amp but I've also hooked it straight into my keyboard's auxiliary audio input. The pre-amp probably helps clean up the sound a little bit. I keep the boom to the side of my mouth so that it's not picking up breathing sounds...I have to speak up a little because of that but it's a small trade-off. I don't really sing so I can't comment on the mic from that respect. Basically, I have no complaints and recommend it.
A1B5X7X3HENNJR	1	1	I'm not sure why but I hadn't read any Dean Koontz before and I almost put this one down at page 20 or so. Enough others have outlined the plot so suffice to say that I was put off a little by the humor and, at times, long drawn out narratives. But, it's an excellent story that really does grab you. An author is really at the top of his or her game when the reader cares about the characters and I certainly found myself very much wrapped up in the lives of Jimmy and Lorrie in this story. This is a really good read with a pleasant ending that leaves you satisfied. 'nuff said.

A1B61IQ01BKM2V	1	0	I would advise the person and the family of the person with a spinal cord injury (SCI) to learn. When you become able to read, that is. I found that I could not read anything at first. Partly because of denial and partly because I was suddenly pluncked down in an alien world, much like the world I had always lived in, just considerably taller. The simplest things I had done before my SCI became incredibly difficult, if they were possible at all. My mind, body and emotions were in such shock that I could not read anything. The information which was given to me became impossible to understand. I didn't ever think that I would just get up and walk, although my dreams were (and still are) full of running, climbing and even flying. I was dealing with pain that cannot be discribed and I got remarkably little help with it. Until my constant pain was somewhat under control, I didn't plan, for the future or even for the next moment.The idea of having some kind of normal life was not even a consideration for me. Just breathing and existing; in an odd sort of way a kind of Zen "being in the moment," was all I could achieve. And it was NOT a form of enlightenment; on the contrary, it was an "indarkenment."So I might not recommend this book for the newly injured. It is possible that it would not make sense, even if the newly injured person were able to read. For someone who is past that first shock and confusion, though, this could be very helpful. It is clear in pointing out that there are as many different people with a SCI as there are people without one. Very clear and helpful in pointing out the main directions which are still available for people with a SCI. Get this book for someone you love, but don't push it. Just make sure it is available and, when the person is really ready, it will be there for them.
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	1	1	A good friend gave me this kit. I had used Burt's Bees Lip Balm before but I had no idea how much I would appreciate this selection of products. The scent of the Hand and Body Lotion is delicious. The way it quickly absorbs and softens my skin is so nice that I would love the lotion even if it had no scent at all. Use the Peppermint Foot Lotion right after a shower and before putting on socks. It is VERY minty and so, if you do not want to feel like a peppermint drop (or smell like one!), you would probably want to use it before putting on shoes, before spending a refreshing time alone, or with someone who loves the peppermint scent. The Lip Balm is as soothing and pleasant as it has always been. This is a very nice gift. I came to this product site intending to order the kit to give as a birthday gift. I am wondering if I should get more for myself before I am in any danger of running out. Who KNEW those bees could make such great things?
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	1	1	I almost hate to review this book because it will publicly link my name with smoking. It is worth it, though, because this review may help someone else to ditch cigarettes. I thought I needed all the help I could get to stop smoking. I liked the approach this author has and I still refer to this book. It has a no nonsense approach that appealed to me and works well into the process of stopping smoking. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering breaking their smoking habit.
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	1	1	I ordered this as part of a birthday present for my mom. It is tricky to get her gifts because she has such high standards. She was thrilled with this trivet and keeps it in view even when she is not using it.
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	0	1	I bought this book, I am ashamed to say. I am also reluctant to review it as I do not really want my name associated with it. However, just to keep someone else from the painful experience of reading the book, I will write a few words.I will never be dining with Suzy Gershman, shopping with her, or visiting her in Paris. We would not run in the same social circles. Both of us are (or would be) glad that our paths will never cross. No matter where we each live, we would never understand each other, nor would we share any common interests.This is the most shallow and self-satisfied non-fiction (?) book I have ever read.Save yourself the cost of even a used copy of this book. Instead, get a few copies of "People." then imagine spending the rest of your life hanging out in stores and buying things you hope to use to impress your "friends." You will not need to read the book.The relationships with people and things described in this book make shallow seem deep. I have not read anything like this before. I kept wishing that I could hit the author in the head and I am NOT a violent person. I plan to avoid anything that is even remotely similar to this book in the future and carefully shunning all the recommendations Amazon has for books I would theoretically like if I would have liked it."Almost French," ha! This book should be titled "Almost Human." I only wish that Amazon would allow me to give it a NEGATIVE star rating.
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	0	0	I bought and read this book. It was not what I wanted nor what I had expected. I think I wanted an unbiased guide, not a critical review. I felt that the author of this book was driven by envy. That he was wishing that his own writing had been greeted by the literary world with the same kind of recognition as was"Infinite Jest."There is a long introduction about the life of David Foster Wallace. This might have been helpful if it would have communicated clearly the complicated thinking and then reflection on THAT thinking that was constantly a part of DFW's mental life.There is a plot summery which does not begin to describe the recursive nature of the writing in" Infinite Jest." I am using the word recursive to mean self examination, Without understanding that DFW was actually consumed in the most humble way by examining every thought of his own and also the myriad possible meanings of everything and everyone he saw and heard, I think it is impossible to understand his writing.Try reading "Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Your Self" by David Lipsky first. If you still want more of a reader's guide, use Google to find academic websites.Although I did buy all three books (through Amazon) I would NOT recommend this book by Steven Burn as an adequate preparation for reading "Infinite Jest."
A1B61IQ01BKM2V	1	1	I really enjoyed this book and it is too bad that Len Williams has not written more books (that I can find, anyway). I thought that it was very much like Michael Connelly's "Lincoln Lawyer." It is gripping and evocative. I would (and have) recommend(ed) "Justice Deferred" to others. It might be JUST what YOU want to read, too!

A1B66SBT6BNI4M	1	1	I use it daily, so far no problems. Its perfect for small jobs. Do not drop it, it will break.One flaw is that its difficult to get the entire puree out due to the shape, particularly for a small job you want to getall the stuff out. Also pour water into it as soon its used. Its difficult to clean if it dry. Overall I am happy with the result.
A1B66SBT6BNI4M	0	0	We keep this in our kitchen, it does seem to clear out any smell within 2-3 hours. Only problem is the loud noise which started (surprise !!) after the amazon return window was closed - I would have returned it otherwise.

It hovers in the air if you throw it just right, so my dog can catch it easier. It's really easy to throw. It floats, and the bright colors are easy to find. I just lost ours at the dog park, and I'm bummed... but will definitely be buying a new one.
A1B6EENAZCUGP0	1	1	I love this calendar! But then again, I'm a total math nerd. I have a math degree, and some of the problems I don't remember how to do. On the other hand, some of the math is very easy. I only gave it 4 stars because the math is rather difficult on some days. If you don't have some college mathematics, this may not be the calendar for you. If you are a math geek like me and want to brush up, then go for it!
A1B6MFLQUO5Z6E	1	1	This was what I consider the best zombie flick modern man _will_ construct at this point in time. I LOVE zombie movies! As sad as it might seem to the "true believer" of the genera; the true Zombie Epic for us has yet to be born! It waits to be conceived! What does our existence say to the Age?

A1B6MFLQUO5Z6E	1	1	This is one of the most visually pleasing games I have ever played. I don't usually like jumping games, but for this game I've made an exception. The game is quite surreal, and very dark. The toys (read weapons) Alice uses are very imaginative, and if you don't move Alice for a while she'll run an animation associated with the toy she's currently wielding. It's Alice in Wonderland for grownups. You can't beat the price, so if you have the system to run it, buy the game.
A1B6MFLQUO5Z6E	0	0	I was very disappointed with this CD. It had one song I really liked, but the rest of the songs sound like Stone Temple Pilots, only, you know, not good. It really almost would have been better if I didn't like any of the songs, then I would never have bought the CD and listened to it...
A1B6MFLQUO5Z6E	1	1	I've played GTAIII on the PS2, the PC, and now on the XBOX, and the XBOX has much better graphics than even my PC version. It's like they've added a layer of texture. Sports cars shimmer, and the old Jalopy's in Vice City have a flat, weathered look. When it rains, the drops run down the &quot;lens&quot; of the camera that follows you. I haven't fully acclimated to the games yet; I still miss my mouse, but the control interface is one of the best I've seen on a consol system. Rockstar Games not only ported GTAIII and Vice City over to the XBOX, they have significantly improved what were already incredible titles. The fact that you can now buy two full games for the price of one is just icing on the cake. Remember this time people, for we may not see another release like this for a very, very long time.

The CyberPoer CP1000AVRLCD is a good size for my Dell computer and all the accessories I use. In the summer in Florida there are daily storms and I haven't had to worry about the computer shutting down since I installed the battery.
A1B7C62ESF21R0	1	1	I have to disagree with most of the recent reviews for this book - I thought it was excellent. I have read books by both Grisham and Baldacci, and I would have to say that Baldacci is better! In 'The Simple Truth' he not only weaves a fantastic tale, his style is sophisticated and intelligent. I find Grisham's books to be directed towards a mass audience, whilst Baldacci is for the more intelligent reader. (I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the last line of the book - apart from that, it's great!)
A1B7C62ESF21R0	1	1	I became an Elizabeth George fan a couple of years ago when I read 'For the Sake of Elena'. I was so impressed, I immediately went back to the first book in the series and have now read them all. I think she's a fantastic author who keeps her readers interested in the ongoing lives of her main characters whilst introducing a new and fascinating murder mystery. 'In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner' does not disappoint - Ms George skilfully keeps you guessing (and misguessing!) right until the end. Fans will enjoy the next episode in the lives of Lynley and Havers. If you have not read Elizabeth George before, I suggest you try this on for size, then go back to the start of the series and read them all. The story is all the more enriched by knowing the history of these wonderful characters.
A1B7C62ESF21R0	1	1	The proof of the pudding is in the eating they say, and the worth of the story is in the telling. The truth of the events surrounding the Arthurian legend are lost to history, but we love to speculate on what really happened. 'Dawnflight' goes far beyond a casual retelling of the legend of Guinevere, and embraces the life of a warrior queen, Chieftainess of her tribe and answerable to no man. Gyanhumara is wonderfully strong, independent and proud, as skilful with the sword as with her biting wit and intelligence. Her duty forces her to make a promise to marry a man who is a recent enemy and may be one still. Until she meets Arthur, the Pendragon, she is resigned to her duty and what is best for her clan. But after she looks into the eyes of her soulmate, she realises she could have so much more - and yet it seems impossible. In the end, Gyan's strength and honour allows her to fulfil her duty to her clan whilst not ignoring her heart.We'll never know what really happened back in the days of Arthur and Guinevere, but I would love to believe that this is the true tale. If the worth of the story is in the telling, then this is pure gold.
A1B7C62ESF21R0	1	1	Wow, what a difference of opinion in most of the reviews here! Well you can't please everyone, but obviously there's plenty of people who loved 'The Poet'. I am one of them. The fabulous-though-flawed hero engaged me in the adventure of a chase for a serial killer, while I also had the benefit of the parallel story looking into the world of the one hunted. There were so many twists and turns in this novel and they were all so cleverly constructed that they were believable. Plenty of hold-your-breath excitement and suspense, plus a very clever ending with a double twist. Warning! If you start it, you might not be able to put it down...
A1B7C62ESF21R0	1	1	I know I'm reading a great book when I can't sleep, can't eat and can't work...just have to finish it! And then of course there's the disappointment when it does finish. The Lion's Game was absolutely great, I love John Corey's wiseass attitude, and the very believable Asad Khalil was terrifying. The technique of alternating chapters between the point of views of John and 'The Lion' was very effective and kept up the interest factor. It's a rare combination to have a thriller to which you can laugh out loud whilst sweating with anticipation! I was happy with the ending that leaves it wide open for another appearance of these two fascinating characters. Bring it on!

A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	What is music coming to? I seriously think my intelligence has been lowered just from hearing this on the radio. This girl has one of the most dreadful voices I have ever heard. You know there are REAL MUSICIANS out there who dont gain a fifth of the attention and respect this chick does. Ones who write their own songs and dont use machines to make themselves sound good (even though even with machines Ashlee Simpson sounds horrible). Really, if it wasnt for her amazingly hot sister nobody would care about this girl. Dont buy this album, please dont give the Simpson family more money.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	This is a side project of one of the Slipknot members, Joey Jordison. Alot of Slipknot fans like it, so right off the bat you can tell not much good is gonna come out of it. The guitar is alright. Tripp Eisen is a reasonably good guitarist, and has some cool riffs here and there, but the rhythm section is very weak, and Wednesday 13s vocals are just bad. The lyrics are also very bad..pretty much just cheesy B horror movie garbage. This is an album that all of the maggots and mall goths are probably going to buy and love, but for anyone whos into real metal...or..music, for that matter, not recommended.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	You can tell touring with Aerosmith and Kiss had a big impact on these guys. With this album they tried to do the whole "rock and roll" sound. The only problem with that is that Saliva doesnt have nearly enough talent to do this type of music. All of these songs are ruined by Josey Scotts whiney, nasal and terrible vocals, and the guitar solos are a joke. The thing is that some of the songs here are decent. Rock and Roll Revolution would be a good song, with a new vocalist and new guitarist. These guys really just need to stick to nu-metal, thats the only genre they have enough talent for (which doesnt require any). And yes...Saliva did steal the riff from "The Fight Song" by Marilyn Manson. Listen to them both and compare. Not recommended.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Killswitch Engage. Slayer. Black Sabbath. Mercyful Fate. Meshuggah. In Flames. Fear Factory. Unearth. Shadows Fall. Guns And Roses. As I Lay Dying. Metallica. Iron Maiden. Arch Enemy. Satyricon. Chevelle. Each and every one of these bands has had "The Last Street Fighter" recommended instead of their albums, and Im sure there are many more. Christians, stop doing that. Im not going to convert. In fact, I think from now on for every CD I see with this book recommended instead of it, Im going to write another 1 star review.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	"A Snow Capped Romance" is a big improvement over 36 Crazyfists first album "Bitterness The Star". Brock Lindow's voice has gotten alot better. HIs screaming sounds alot more intense and his singing voice has improved alot. You may not like Brocks voice at first, it is different, but you have to let it grow on you. Once it does, youll love it, its very emotional and heartfelt. The rest of the band is good. They dont play anything mind blowing, but there are some good riffs and its enough to make it interesting. I would give a track by track rating but it would be very redundant because all of the tracks here are very good. If I had to pick favorites, they would be "The Heart And The Shape", "Bloodwork" and "Skin and Atmosphere", but there are no weak tracks. Overall this is a very solid album that you should enjoy whether your interest be in metal or nu-metal, 36CF is kind of on the edge of both. This is an interesting listen and if you havent heard these guys, check them out. They dont get the attention they deserve.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	36 Crazyfists is a very talented band that doesnt get half the attention they deserve. While bands like Slipknot and Korn tear up the charts, 36 Crazyfists is one of rocks best kept secrets, and its a shame. 36 Crazyfists in my opinion are sort of on the borderline between metal and nu-metal. They arent quite heavy or technical enough to really be classified as metal, but they are..well, too good to be classified as nu-metal, although by genre they could be.THE GOOD:The first thing I noticed about this band was the vocalist. He has a very weird and unique singing voice. It takes an acquired taste, but once you get used to it youll love it. His vocals are very emotional and heartfelt which really drive the songs. The lyrics are also very good. The musicianship is good. They dont do anything mind blowing but they do enough to keep you interested.THE BAD:Well, the vocals may annoy some people. Like I said, they do take some getting used to, Brocks singing voice isnt much like youll hear anywhere else. Once you get used to it youll love it, but some people will put the CD down before they get used to it. Another problem : 36 Crazyfists is classifiable as nu-metal. This isnt a problem for me. Im pretty open minded, I listen to the bands I like and try not to pay too much attention to genres, but some people will hear that this is nu-metal and instantly discredit it, when it is really better than any nu-metal out there.Overall, this is a very good CD and I strongly recommend it no matter what genre of rock or metal you are into.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Some people were disappointed by this album, but I cant understand why. In my opinion its every bit as good as Alive Or Just Breathing. Howard Jones is just as good as Jesse Leach. He has a very uniquely deep singing voice which is nice to hear, and he can scream every bit as good as Jesse Leach. The drumming has improved on this album, and the guitar has as well. The riffs have sort of a more epic kind of feel to them, and they even threw in a solo in Breathe Life. Overall this is a very solid album you should check out.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	1	In my opinion, Bleeding Through is a band with alot of potential. All of the members of the band are talented, particularly the drummer. But they just dont put their talent to good use. Like someone said above, this CD is like 1 big 45 minute track. It sounds like 1 song pasted onto an album 12 times..and while the 1 song is damn good in my opinion, I cant listen to this album all the way through.PROS:Well, in my opinion the vocals are very good. Brandon S. is a good screamer and is extremely aggressive. He doesnt use his clean voice alot but when he does it contrasts nicely with his screaming. In my opinion hes a talented vocalist. The rest of the band is good too. The guitar is good, but the rhythm section is especially very good. The drumming was impressive, and if you watch any of their music videos the bass is pretty crazy, but its often buried under the rest of the instruments. Marta, the keyboardist doesnt play anything complicated or hard..but she does still give the album a unique touch, and Bleeding Through wouldnt be the same without her. Like I stated above...Bleeding Through is a talented band! But...CONS:...all of the songs sound too god damn alike. It really honestly feels like they wrote 1 song and made minor changes to it 12 times and called it an album. The lyrics could also be better. Theyre not terrible, but theyre too angsty for my taste and at times seem like theyre aimed at the Hot Topic crowd.Overall, I think Bleeding Through is a band with monster potential..but like I said, they dont use it, and with the little variety this CD has I cant bring myself to give it more than 2 stars.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	1	If youre a disenfranchised teen who likes bands such as Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, etc. this is something that youll undoubtedly like. But the fact of the matter is this album is really just beating a dead horse. If youve heard Puddle Of Mudd and Nirvana youve heard this band and they dont bring anything new to the table. They dont have any real musical talent, and the singer is a 4th rate Kurt Cobain.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	1	"for the last time, slipknot aint nu metal. theyre heavy as hell f---ing death metal. theyre lyrics arent along the lines of i hate my life its more like i wanna slit your throat and f--k the wound you dont c any p--sy numetal bands singin bout dat s--t."Wow. The things Slipknot fans say never cease to amaze me. If you want a halfway decent numetal band, check out Mudvayne or Nothingface. If you really want "heavy as hell death metal" check out Kataklysm, Nile or Cryptopsy. You little hot topic kids are such morons.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Alot of people dont like Stone Sour, and usually its for one of two reasons. Some people dont like Stone Sour because they are die hard Slipknot fans, and Stone Sour isnt "hard" enough for them. Other people dont like them because Corey Taylor is in the band, and they hate Slipknot to begin with. Generally I listen to alot of metal bands like Lamb Of God, Pantera, Slayer, In Flames, etc, so I didnt bother to look into Stone Sour right away. I heard Bother on the radio a few times and was actually somewhat impressed. Curiosity got the best of me, and I bought the Stone Sour album. I got alot more than I expected...first of all the lyrical content is alot different from Slipknots. There is alot more content, and it is less...well, whiny. The musicianship is alot better as well. Its nothing mind blowing, but its enough to keep you interested, and they do it with 5 members instead of 9. Corey also shows off his singing voice a whole lot more here. Theres only a few times during this album when he screams. The album has alot of variety. Songs like Bother and Monolith are much slower and calmer songs, while songs like Get Inside and Tumult will tear your face off. Overall, if youre into Slipknot or any nu-metal, you should like this, if youre not, at least give it a chance.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	While Bleeding Throughs Portrait Of A Godess doesnt add much new to the table, it is still a very good album. I would definetely recommend this instead of This Is Love This Is Murderous. TILTIM is a pretty generic and boring album. True, Bleeding Through are your typical metalcore band, but they play their music with more passion, fury, aggression and energy than most of them out there. The musicianship is pretty good, especially the drumming. The keyboards in this CD are also pretty interesting. The keyboardist Marta doesnt play anything hard or complicated, but she does add a different element to the music. The highlight tracks here are "Rise" and "Portrait Of A Goddess", two of the most aggressive metalcore songs that youll ever hear. Recommended
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Sevendust is a great band who have been able to evolve every album, and this in my opinion is their best effort yet. Some songs like "Enemy" and "Face To Face" are classic Sevendust, but overall this album has a whole lot more melody than any of Sevendusts previous albums. Songs like "Honesty" and "Broken Down" are slower and more emotional songs. In fact, "Skeleton Song" is a completely acoustic song that is very touching (on the same level as "Angels Son")The musicianship, as it is with all hard rock or nu-metal bands, is nothing mind blowing. But by typical nu-metal standards, it is actually somewhat impressive. The riffs are memorable, and the drumming is very good as well.Lajon Witherspoons vocals are some of the best and most unique vocals that you will hear in hard rock. This guy can flat out SING. His vocals are very emotional and soulful, but on the few moments on this CD where he growls he sounds very good as well. The lyrics on this CD are very good as well - this CD contains some of the best songs that Sevendust have ever written.If you liked Sevendusts past albums I would definitely recommend this one, but if youre just getting into them this is a good place to start. My ONLY gripe with this CD is that the cover really sucks, its just them standing there. But who really cares, the fact that the only bad thing I can find to say about this album is the cover says something.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Siren Song Of The Counter Culture is a CD that I have been looking for for a long time. A CD that expresses honest emotions, but doesnt make you feel like a pansy when you listen to it. The song writing here is top notch. The lyrics can pack an emotional punch but are actually well thought out and well written. The vocals are good too, in my opinion. His singing voice is very rough, but he sings with alot of conviction that makes you believe he really feels what he is singing about. Some people are turned off by the screaming, but my main genre of interest is metal actually, so I think the screaming sounds good. Unlike alot of bands out there today the lead singer can scream without sounding pathetic. The music is nothing mind blowing, but it is played well and is better than what youll normally hear from bands of the same genre, theres even a couple guitar solos. This is a CD you should definitely check out if you liked Rise Againsts older albums, and if youre just getting into them this is a good place to start.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	0	These days, most mainstream rock and nu-metal does very little to impress me. I find that alot of it is lame and pretentious, but Breaking Benjamin do a few certain things right which is why I like them alot.First of all, they avoid whiny lyrical cliches. Breaking Benjamins lyrics certainly arent eloquent poetry. Their lyrics and messages are pretty straight forward, but they do avoid the "I hate my life and parents" lines that it seems are so common in todays nu-metal.Another thing Breaking Benjamin has, that alot of other bands dont is a little thing called talent. I hate to keep bagging on nu-metal, because I know alot of you out there do listen to it, it just doesnt do much for me. All of Breaking Benjamins members can handle their respective instruments pretty well. All of the instruments go together very well, the guitar and bass parts are much less simple than what youll often hear. The drumming is nothing mind blowing, but it isnt bad. The vocalist is very good as well. He can sing pretty well, as he shows on the last track "Rain". But he can also growl without sounding pathetic, as he shows on "Believe".Overall, I think almost no matter what genre of rock music you listen to youll enjoy this CD. My favorite songs on this album are "So Cold", "Follow" and "Believe", but no tracks stand out as being very weak.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	1	Seriously. Listen to "Someday" and "How You Remind Me" at exactly the same time. They are almost the EXACT same song!! Try it for yourself, I urge you.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	"Dont blame us if we ever doubt ya, you know we couldnt live without ya, Red Sox, you are the onlyyy..."Couldntve said it better myself. This is the official song for the Red Sox now, and I suppose it worked. But, even without the Red Sox references, this is still a good song. DKM have an interesting Irish/Rock/Punk sound that suprisingly works very well with the lyrics of the song.RED SOX - 2004 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Okay, I really dont like doing these types of reviews. I dont mean one star reviews, I do alot of one star reviews. I mean writing a review on somebody as talentless and fake as Lindsay Lohan. Its pretty unnecessary to point it out because I think most people have figured it out. But this girl is completely devoid of any talent. First of all, actresses/actors shouldnt become musicians. This album above all proves that anybody can become a musician (and I use that term loosely) if they want to pay the bill themselves. This girl has no singing talent...shes exactly like every other Britney, Hilary, Ashlee, etc. who use machines to make them sound good, but even with a machine...she still sounds terrible! Another thing that must be pointed out is that most of these pop artists dont even write their own songs. All of their songs are written for them and all they have to do is sing into a machine and dress skanky, and they can get all of the attention in the world. I dont know if Lindsay wrote these songs or not. I doubt it. But if she did, maybe she should find someone to write her songs for her because they are really that bad. For gods sake, please stop supporting bubble gum pop like this.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Im sorry, but I just have no understanding of what people see in this band. I have listened to this album a few times, and every time it just seems more boring and shallow. They give you very straight forward and generic messages that other bands send better. The music has no meaning or emotion and really just feels like a band created by a record label for disenfranchised teens and the MTV "rock" sound.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Before I write my review, just let me say: I understand where people are coming from saying that Incubus "sold out", making songs based on the huge success of their single "Drive". But that isnt true. When Drive became successful, this album was already almost done, so please, dont accuse them of selling out. Its expirementation, its evolution, and in my opinion it worked out wonderfully. Bands evolve, just like us human beings. If Incubus had decided to make 5 S.C.I.E.N.C.E's instead of expanding their sound, they would have been long gone by now. Now, onto the review.Musically and lyrically, this album is very diverse. You have your pretty standard, angsty type of lyrics on songs like "Circles" and "11 AM", but other songs like "Nice To Know You" tread completely different territory. Nice To Know You is about Brandon Boyd breaking his arm, and finally regaining feeling in it. Only a band like Incubus could pull off a song like that.Musically, this album is very interesting as well. You have your straight up alternative rock songs like Circles and Warning, but there are also softer, acoustic guitar driven tracks like 11 AM, Mexico and Aqueous Transmission. The latter being particularly interesting, as it contains a 'Kyo-Ku'-an instrument with an interesting sound, that is very foreign to Incubus and rock music itself. Other standouts include "Are You In", a very light and calm song that has kind of a jazzy feel to it, and "Blood On The Ground". Textbook Incubus, but impressive nonetheless.Overall this is an album that I would recommend to anyone who was a fan of Incubus before and is willing to accept a little bit of change, or to anyone who's a fan of alternative rock.Hightlights: Nice To Know You, Circles, Wish You Were Here, 11 AM, Blood On The Ground, Are You In
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Yes, so Ill admit it. The way these guys look is pretty cheesy, they do fit the description of your typical high school "goth". But behind the eye liner and fingernail polish they have loads of talent, and if you discredit a band simply because you dont like the way they look you are a moron.The guitar in this album is exceptional, the guitarists have grown by leaps and bounds since Sounding The Seventh Trumpet. The riffs are much more epic and in more of a metalcore direction this album, which works very well. The drumming is also extremely impressive, very fast, and any drummer should appreciate the way he attacks the kit. M Shadows is a good vocalist in my opinion, although he is disliked by many. His screaming isnt the most intimidating that youll ever hear but it still sounds very good, and he obviously puts emotion into what he does. His clean voice is quite good, unlike other metalcore bands like Shadows Fall who have good screaming parts and awful clean vocals, M Shadows can really sing. I almost wish he would sing more.The songs on this album are very long and creative, almost every song reaching the 5 minute mark (and the few that dont are off by mere seconds), and the songs never stay the same throughout. This is definitely something Id advise you to check out if you liked Avenged Sevenfolds previous albums, or if youre just looking for some good metalcore.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Ill keep this very short. If you can, imagine Iron Maiden, Dream Theater and Opeth all rolled into one, and what you would get is Into Eternity. They are a progressive metal band, but also have some 80s type influences and an Opeth-esque vocal style at times. The drumming, guitar and bass are all extremely impressive and techincal, but the thing that sticks out the most are the vocals. The vocalist can sing excellently, but he can growl equally well, he is truly amazing. My favorite songs are "Spiralling Into Depression", "Three Dimensional Aperture" and "Beginning Of The End", but all of the tracks are extremely impressive. Pick this album up immediately.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	I wrote a review for this album almost a year ago. I gave it five stars. In the last year my tastes have expanded VERY much, Ive gotten out of the nu-metal scene and into mainly metalcore, thrash metal and death metal. But my opinion on this album remains the same. This is a highly emotional nu-metal album that is delivered more than competently when compared with the KoRns and Slipknots coming out every day today. They obviously put loads of emotion into what they do, and its apparent in every song. The musicianship wont blow your mind. Nothing too technical or innovative, but its actually sharper than alot of the other hard rock bands today. But the main attraction here is Chris Volz. Chriz Volz's vocals really steal the show on this album. He can sing very well- he has a singing voice that is quite similair to David Draimans, but is still very much his own. When he growls, every line overflows with emotion, and his singing voice and growl contrast eachother nicely. If Flaw has one problem, its the occasional clumsy lyric. Songs like My Letter and Whole have very good lyrics, but theres actually a line in the song Payback that goes "Guess what...you suck!". Okay, lets be serious. You can do better than that. But all in all, the lyrics are good. Simple, but good. If you listen to nu-metal and hard rock, I would say give this a shot. Or if you listen to metal and are bored with all of the watered down crap thats coming out on the radio these days, I would also give this album a try.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Lately, I have been having alot of trouble figuring out whether or not I like Staind. In the last few months, Ive written several reviews for this album. Ive given a few 5 stars, then deleted them and given 1 star reviews, and now Ive finally settled upon a 3.5, but Ill favor the four. On the one hand, Staind is a cut above many of todays god awful, boring contrived nu-metal. Examples of which being Godsmack, Union Undergound, Slipknot, etc. But on the other hand they come off as somewhat of a grunge knock off, and dont do anything incredibly original. But the thing that always ends up bringing me back to this album is the emotion they put into their songs. They clearly believe in what they do and it shows in every song. There is not one weak track on this album, all 13 of them shine, and there is no filler. The guitar riffs are good. Nothing wildly technical, but good nonetheless, youll remember them. But the thing that sticks out the most with this release are the vocals. Aaron Lewis really steals the show with his vocal capability here. His singing voice soars over all the rest of these legions of faceless nu-metal voice boxes. The lyrics are in my opinion, pretty good. Although they may come off as "whiney" to some people (and yes, there is an enormous amount of self pity in Aaron Lewis' lyrics) the songs are written more than competently. Overall if you liked Stainds previous releases, this is a pretty big departure, but the songs are still well written and well delivered and there is no reason that everybody doesnt give this album a try.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Alright Nickelback fans, please, Im begging you. Before you buy this album, before you give a four or five star review or before you automatically click the "no" button at the bottom of this review, do something for me. If you happen to have 2 cd players handy, listen to "Someday" and "How You Remind Me" at the same time. Beat for beat, line for line, they are the EXACT same song. These guys have absolutely no originality; from the start theyve been ripping off grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Days Of The New. And now theyre just writing the same songs over and over to sell to the naive, impressionable people who buy this junk and dont realize that Nickelback are only in it for the money. Stop supporting this band and all of its sound alikes.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	But their best, nonetheless, in my opinion. When I first heard "What Drives The Weak" on Music Choice Metal, I was actually quite disappointed. Its a good song, but it definitely lacks the heaviness and punch of songs like "Thoughts Without Words" or "Destroyer Of Senses". Then soon after, I heard the song "Power Of I And I" and I loved it. It has a more upbeat, almost rock and roll sound to it and there is an amazing guitar solo. I decided to pick this album up since it got rave reviews and, well, cause it was cheap. And I was definitely not disappointed. One thing this album does have in common with all of Shadows Falls other albums are the guitar solos. Jon Donais is an amazing guitar player and I can definitely imagine him reaching Zakk Wylde or Dimebag Darrell (R.I.P) status someday. The drumming is also very impressive as well. The main difference between this album and Shadows Falls previous albums is melody. The older songs were typically heavy, and then there were instrumentals to break it up, but on this album there are no instrumentals and melody is just used alot more in the songs. Like I said, the solos are still there, but clean vocals are used a ton more, and they sound very good honestly. I thought Brian Fairs clean voice was just "so so" before this album, but in songs like "Enlightened By The Cold" he shows he can really sing. If you liked Shadows Falls previous albums then you should definitely pick this up. But no matter what genre of metal your main interest is in, this CD will not fail to impress you.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Yeah, I realize that that song isnt on this album. But I just find it hilarious that they would write a song about famous people "pissing and moaning" and then turn around and make a song like "Predictable", where Joel sings/yells prepubescently about pathetic high school drama. I know most of you mall punks who are over weight 8th graders who wear star wrists bands are scared of singers who have actually hit puberty, so Im not going to bother recommending another band or album because having an intelligent conversation with a Good Charlotte fan is damn near impossible. Open your eyes; they want your money!
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	1	Whatever happened to the old Metallica? The thrashy Metallica who wrote insightful lyrics? This is definitely one of the worst songs they have ever recorded, although most of the songs on their newest atrocity St Anger are worse than this one. Nonetheless, I dont understand why Metallica would write and record this song as a single when they are obviously capable of SO much more.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	This album is pretty much everything youd expect. "Got The Life", "Freak On A Leash", "Blind", etc. all of Korns songs that have been on the radio or on MTV, with a couple of unreleased songs thrown in. In my opinion its fairly obvious this is a money making ploy, considering that Take A Look In The Mirror flopped, and nu-metal itself is a sinking ship. The two new songs are awful, honestly. "Word Up" is definitely a new direction for the band, but is that really a good thing? It was awful in the first place as a techno song so making it into an equally pathetic genre; nu-metal, doesnt help it much. I would also like to say that Korn butchered "Another Brick In The Wall". This is a very weak collection but luckily, we wont have to put up with this much longer.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	Every day, I find myself drifting further and further away from this type of rock music. Ive found that way too many of the rock bands coming out today have no soul or emotion, and are simply going through the motions. Luckily, Fuel arent one of these bands.Now when Im drifting away from mainstream rock, my main genre of interest is metal. Lamb Of God, In Flames and Pantera are 3 of my favorite bands, but I still really enjoy this CD just because of the emotion. No; it doesnt have frantic drumming, blazing guitar solos and harsh growling vocals. Nor does it have weak whining and screaming over distorted guitars. All it is is 4 guys, playing music and believing in what they are doing, and that is why I have been able to hang on to this CD.The first thing that stands out when you listen to Fuel are the vocals. Brett Scallions has a somewhat raspy style of singing that makes him somewhat distinct. Granted the musicianship is nothing amazing, but for this type of music it doesnt have to be, and in fact there actually is a guitar solo in "Sunburn" (whens the last time you heard Nickelback play a guitar solo?). The lyrics are good as well. Theyre simple and emotional, and I think most people can relate to the songs.Overall, this is a very solid CD that any fans of rock should like. But, if youre getting tired of the stuff thats being played on the radio and are seeking something a little bit different, I would give Fuel a try.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	0	0	Wow...For once, Im seriously at a loss of words. Can somebody please explain to me WHAT is so special about this movie? After all of the morons in my grade raved about it, and all of my friends encouraging me to watch it, I decided to finally sit down and watch it...and I seriously think it lowered my IQ. Napoleon's character is outwardly dumb and awkward, and its funny! For the first 15 minutes. After that I just felt like throwing something at my TV for the whole movie. There is NO plot here whatsoever. Napoleon tries to get together with another outwardly dumb and awkward girl, while his outwardly dumb and awkward friend runs for class president. To appreciate this movie you would have to be completely brain dead.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	This is an incredible performance from Alice In Chains. One of the first things that really struck me about it was that often times you would forget that its a live album. Jerry Cantrells playing is so precise, and Layne Staleys voice so powerful (especially with him and Jerry harmonizing) that it sounds just as good as a studio version. They play the obvious favorites such as Down In A Hole, Rooster and Nutshell, but they also played a few of their heavier songs such as Would and Angry Chair, which suprisingly translate well into acoustic versions. This is an essential pick up for any Alice In Chains fan, it shows their great live performance and their passion and emotion.R.I.P Layne Staley
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	If youre expecting "300 Percent Density" then this album will throw you for a loop by comparison, but if you listen to this album with an open mind then you will definitely find alot to like. How is it that Candiria can mix metal, hardcore, JAZZ and the most hated genre of all metalheads, RAP and still maintain credible, but when they try to infuse melody into their songs theres such a big fuss? This CD contains more examples of everything that Candiria does right, simply with the addition of some melody (Remove Yourself, Down). It still has the familiar shifting time signatures and great musicianship, and they even have their trademark rap song on here (9MM Solution). Overall this is a good album that is very enjoyable when listened to with an open mind..as another reviewer said, dont be an elitist.
A1B7HB2XV9GRJP	1	1	After listening to Mastodons previous album Remission, an album based around the story of Moby Dick probably isnt quite what you would expect. But Mastodon pull it off better than you could imagine. From the thundering chorus of Blood And Thunder to the acoustic tinged Joseph Merrick, this album is pure metal perfection. What sets Mastodon apart from alot of the metal bands today, is that no two songs sound the same. Just as Moby Dick has no two chapters where the exact same thing happens, every song on Leviathan has a life of its own. "Blood And Thunder" is an epic with a good guitar riff and a huge chorus. "Iron Tusk" and "Megalodon" are perhaps the two heaviest songs on the album, while directly following is the somewhat Rush-esque "Naked Burn". Then comes the highly atmospheric, 13 minute long "Hearts Alive", which is directly followed by the haunting partially acoustic "Joseph Merrick". This is definitely something you want to pick up if you enjoyed Mastodons previous work, or, well, if you enjoy metal at all.
A1B7RNKYL0TG66	1	1	we watch this movie a lot, it is heartfelt and has something for everyone as well as a great life lessons tool as well, without even knowing it your being taught at the same time and even my 8 year old son loved it..

A1B7Y5D9IFTF	1	1	Remember stirrup pants? I used to wear my mom's all the time, back in the 80s. "No, you shouldn't wear women's clothing," my mom would say to me. But I would wear her pants anyhow.Well, I don't have to disobey her anymore! Look! Stirrup stockings! My prayers have been answered!Nowadays I walk around wearing my Lumiscope Stirrup Stockings and NOTHING ELSE. I stand out in a crowd now, let me tell you. Not only are these stockings great as my (only) piece of formalwear, I think I cut a dashing figure when wearing them on horseback.Lumiscope Stirrup Stockings: Kind of like shorts, but the other direction.
A1B7Y5D9IFTF	0	0	I picked up this practice hand thinking I could use it for all kinds of practice.For instance, I wanted to practice my tattooing skills. This is NOT the hand for that! I busted all my needles trying to put ACAB on the knuckles and not a single letter came out right!I also thought this would be a good product for practicing voodoo: You know, kind of an 'evil floating hand' kind of deal. Wrong again! It wouldn't float, it wasn't even SLIGHTLY evil, and I couldn't get it to respond to any commands! It does look like a leftover prop from a Nine Inch Nails video, I will admit.Speaking of nails, I couldn't very well practice my unstoppable filing technique with this practice hand. I filed the nails down and then they were gone! They do NOT grow back! Caveat Emptor!I practiced hand-holding, and that worked out well. My practice hand and I went to the movies, and I held it the whole time. So I'll give it an extra star for that. Later that evening, though, when I tried to practice onanism, it totally didn't work the way I wanted it to.In summary: The professional practice hand is a worthwhile addition to you limb collection, but doesn't really do what you might think.
A1B7Y5D9IFTF	1	1	I was looking for something giant. And by giant, I don't mean 'somewhat large' or 'biggish' or 'huge by some peoples standards'. No, I wanted giant ones.Well dog my cat! These giant ones are GIANT! Every one of them... a whole box of giant ones! It's like, you take one out and you think, "Hmmm... that was pretty giant. There couldn't be ANOTHER giant one in there, could there be?" And then you reach in the box and... ANOTHER GIANT ONE COMES OUT! Whoo ha! Yes! You can repeat this little drama one thousand times! It's amazing!Now, I'm only giving the Giant Ones four stars because they weren't really paradigm shifting. I mean, there weren't The Incredibly Amazing Gargantuan Ones or anything. But they certainly are giant enough for me.The Giant Ones: Kind of like The Small Ones, only Gianter.
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	1	1	In this book, Nock discusses in full length his theory of education in general, and the state of education in the United States in particular. Nock's main objectives are to delineate the differences between education and training and to describe what constitutes true education in his view.The best review of the book can be found in the introduction, written by his son Francis.To summarize, Nock's main flaws are his lack of scientific education (he would refer to it as scientific training), and more important, his lack of understanding of the importance of science in societal evolution and progress. It is sad to read a true man of letters like Nock regarding science and technology as unrelated to education.Nonetheless, Nock's main observation is correct: being a great scientist, physician, or inventor does not preclude one from being an uneducated brute when it comes to the philosophical aspects of life. If you are a member of academia, just look around you and see the veracity of Nock's claims: how many ingenious professors, scientists, researchers, doctors and engineers do you know who are ignoramus nincompoops when it comes to history, philosophy, economics, and political theory?Despite its flaws, this book is a must read for every person wishing to become truly educated.As a companion to this book, I recommend Nock's great essays "The disadvantages of being educated" and "The value of useless knowledge".
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	1	1	These two DVDs comprise a good introduction to yoga for beginners. The instructor works slowly through the postures, explaining the techniques and benefits. Each DVD contains twelve postures. The first DVD includes basic postures, while the second DVD contains more advanced postures and also a 15-minute primer on meditation.I found it quaint that the instructor finds the lunge position more challenging than the tree position (balancing on one foot with the other foot against your thigh). I am not sure if this stems from misunderstanding of the difficulty of the postures or it may be just a glitch in editing, but by and large, these DVDs are certainly worth their price. Recommended for beginners with no prior knowledge of yoga.
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	1	1	Earl Strom is regarded by many as the greatest referee in NBA history. He was officiating NBA games for over forty years, and his insights tell a lot about the changes in the game over the years.The book is comprised mostly of insights, stories, and reflections about the game and Strom's career. It contains some sound advice for beginning officials, as well as interesting technical criticisms of officiating mechanics today compared to the mechanics of the fifties and sixties. It also contains hilarious stories from behind the scenes - fights with fans, for example, something you will never see in an NBA game today. Overall, this book is a must for every fledgling basketball official and basketball enthusiast.
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	0	0	Most great books make bad movies (e.g. 1984). This film is no exception - bad acting, bad editing, sloppy "translation" of the book into a movie. The entire sarcastic brilliance of the book was lost in the movie. All of Yossarian's brilliant antics sound hollow and out of context, Milo's capitalist endeavors are depicted badly, the Generals' insanity is barely noticeable, and where is ex-PFC Wintergreen anyway?Don't waste your time or your money - read the book instead.
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	1	1	This is one of the best albums ever composed, especially thanks to Hallowed Be Thy Name. The coordination is perfect, the bass never sounded better, and Bruce Dickinson proves once and for all that he is the best vocalist in the history of music.22 ACACIA AVENUE is a unique song, angry and melancholic at the same time. You can hear the pain in Bruce's voice as he sings it. The man is no actor - he sings from his heart. The switch from aggressive lyrics to a melodic guitar solo at 3:50 is beautiful. The song ends with another great bass stretch.THE PRISONER is not a great song, but it exhibits some great bass work.RUN TO THE HILLS is the best known piece of the album. It is great, but too short to qualify for a masterpiece designation. It is nonetheless rhythmic, fast, and the lyrics speak for themselves.THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST brings many people to believe hat Iron Maiden are some sort of devil worshippers. Pay no attention to this nonsense. It is a true heavy metal piece - guitars, aggressive vocals, the works. The "satanic" lyrics just add to the aura. Great song.CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED is another occult one, and exhibits great vocals with great guitars. Again, Dickinson does a fantastic job conveying the spirit of the song with his voice.Along with REVELATIONS and INFINITE DREAMS, HALLOWED BE THY NAME is Iron Maiden's best piece ever. The lyrics are brilliant, and Dickinson's voice pierces the soul. This is a classic Maiden piece, dealing with death and the life thereafter, and can easily bring tears to your eyes. The guitar solo beginning at 4:33 and lasting until the end is fantastic, and all the instruments are in perfect harmony. This is a true masterpiece.Nothing is perfect, and neither is this album. GANGLAND, INVADERS, and TOTAL ECLIPSE are mediocre.
A1B7YZA0SP9IF8	1	1	It you were to choose your first Maiden album, this should be it. It is not their best, but it captures the essence of the band perfectly. Unlike Seventh Son, for example, it is not heavy on lyrics and latent meanings, so it is easy for beginners to get into. It is also the band's first album with Nicko McBrain on the drums, and this group - McBrain, Dickinson, Harris, Smith, and Murray - proceeded to produce some of the Maiden's best albums.Now, to the contents:Where Eagles Dare is a classic opener - aggressive, fast, and will get you right into the Maiden frame-of-mind. It is also quite repetitive, which may become boring if you listen to it often.Revelations is one of their greatest ever. It is not a typical Maiden song, as it is slow and melancholic at times, but herein lie its true beauty and uniqueness. The guitar solo is great, and the lyrics are touching, if abstruse.Flight of Icarus is one of their most famous. Based on the myth of Icarus and Daedalus, it tells the story of the boy who flew too close to the sun. It is short but powerful.Die with Your Boots On is not a great song, but it ends very nicely with a guitar solo and Dickinson's "they died with their boots on" screams. The guy has the best male voice in the history of music.The Trooper may be their most famous and successful song ever. Aggressive, fast-paced, and speaking of war and death, it is a Maiden classic. Smith and Murray do a great job on the guitars.Still Life is great particularly because of the lyrics. Dark, mysterious, and macabre, it speaks of nightmares meshing with reality, and, of course, death. The entire Maidenian spirit is captured in this song.Quest for Fire is short and boring, but it contains an excellent guitar solo.Sun and Steel is short, highly repetitive, and one of their worst ever.To Tame a Land is a perfect piece to end an album. Written by Harris and based on the series of "Dune" sci-fi books, its pace changes frequently and it ends with a fantastic guitar solo, one of their best solos ever.In summon, while not their greatest album, it is nonetheless a masterpiece that every Maiden enthusiast should cherish.
A1B839RD9TOC9O	1	1	My wife and I were, in many ways, in the same boat as the Learys - our child was born at 28 weeks, with a variety of health problems, and had to spend 10 weeks in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (the American version of the British SCBU). We were astounded by the parallels between her thought process and ours. Over and over, we read of the exact same thoughts, worries and conversations that we had.This is a great book for the parents of premature or otherwise complicated babies. Reading this, you'll see that what you're feeling is normal; that your thoughts and your worries are shared by others. As such, it makes good 'therapy,' without being heavy-handed.
A1B839RD9TOC9O	1	1	I'm afraid that the previous reviewer misses the point about the maze. It is designed to allow the user to shift the walls as they progress through the maze; it is not intended to be a static maze as if on paper.There are 16 starting configurations listed on the back of the product, and they increase in difficulty as they progress. Early settings require either no or very limited manipulation of the walls to complete. As you go on to more advanced settings, however, you encounter ever-more-complicated mazes that require you to plan ahead to determine whether moving a given wall will help you or hurt you in the long run.This is a great toy to teach strategic thinking, and is suitable for a variety of ages (some of the more advanced maze configurations are quite challenging).
A1B839RD9TOC9O	0	1	I'd love to have a good computer/video game version of Mage Knight; unfortunately, this isn't it.Things I didn't like:- No skirmish mode. Thus, the only battles you'll fight are in the poorly-scripted campaign mode. Got a favorite tabletop army you like to use? Too bad, you can't use it here.- Overly-restrictive turn limits. Most scenarios have turn limits that force hyper-aggressive (rather than allowing for strategic and careful) gameplay, and many of these turn limits make no sense in the context of the scenario. For example, early on, you have to capture a necromatic priestess in order to win the battle. If you have wiped out her entire army and have her surrounded at the end of 20 turns (but haven't yet made the difficult "capture" roll), you lose. There's no "in game" reason for this - it would be forgivable if there were imminent enemy reinforcements arriving or something like that, but there aren't. You are thus forced to continuously "push" (and thus weaken) your troops just to get around the turn limit problems.- Bizarre victory conditions. In early scenarios, your goal is simply to make it through a forest. Yet for these scenarios, the victory conditions require you to control flags that are frequently well off the beaten path in dead-end sections of woods. If my goal is to traverse a forest, why on earth would I want to go out of my way to explore out-of-the way sections of it? If it was a random skirmish game, I'd forgive this, but since I'm forced to play the campaign game, I'd like to have victory conditions that make sense.- No hardcopy reference for abilities. I haven't played tabletop Mage Knight in years, and I don't have all of the abilities memorized. The manual lists exactly ZERO icons for special abilities. You can determine a unit's special abilities during combat, but the procedure to do so is undocumented.Things I liked:- It's better than no Mage Knight at all.- Good touch screen support.- Good use of top screen as a battle overview while the bottom screen is a zoomed in view of your troops.
A1B839RD9TOC9O	0	0	I really wanted to like Spore, and I even (was foolish enough to have) bought the game knowing about the SecuROM controversy. Unfortunately, the game experience is very watered down.The cell stage is extraordinarily basic (not terribly surprising, given that you're playing a single-celled organism. You swim around, eating plant matter, meat that's floating around, or smaller creatures. You try to avoid the big creatures that want to eat you. Creature stage is a bit more coplex, but not much. Tribe and civilization stages are essentially dumbed-down versions of any civ-type or RTS game released over the last decade or so. As to the space stage, it's about as much fun as Master of Orion III was. Which is to say, not much.What is interesting is the robust suite of creation tools. You've got a lot of freedom to make some truly interesting creatures, building, spaceships, etc. Unfortunately, you need to buy the expansion pack in order to get many of the creature body part options that should have been in the game in the initial release. If you're inclined to tinker and see what you can come up with, you'll likely enjoy the game. Otherwise, if your tastes run to casual gaming, you may like this. If you're looking for a serious species simulation, I regret to say that Spore isn't it.And, of course, it's published by EA, so one must take into account that the company injects malware into your computer when you load the game.
A1B839RD9TOC9O	1	1	Let me preface this by saying that I am not a big fan of horror in general (outside of Lovecraft and King)and the zombie apocalypse sub-genre in particular. That being said, World War Z is one of the most effective and gripping books I've read in years. Indeed, it's the first novel in a long time that I've read in a single sitting."Novel," however, is not the most accurate way to describe it. As other reviewers have noted, this is written in the form of several short vignettes representing interviews with survivors of the Zombie War. As such, you might think that there wouldn't be any drama - after all, the subjects being interviewed all survived the war, so they are not at risk. This is not the case. Brooks deftly writes dozens of these short vignettes, and they evoke the horror and heroism, the despair and the drama of the war. There's not a lot of graphic violence here - this is not splatterpunk, and those looking for that genre should seek elsewehere. Rather, the horror comes as much from what is implied (how survivors managed to live through a winter without food, for example) as much as what is shown.As such, it's a surprisingly emotionally affecting book, particularly given that none of the characters are seen for a long period of time (very few appear in more than one vignette). There are, admittedly, some errors (some of the military jargon and space technology/orbital mechanics are jarringly wrong, but only about 2% of readership will even notice this, so I won't mark the book down for it), and some aspects of the war cry out for more detail (how, in the midst of the Great Panic, were the Western States pacified and consolidated?). But these are minor quibbles.You do NOT have to be a fan of horror to enjoy this book. Bravo, Mr Brooks.
A1B839RD9TOC9O	1	1	The Long Run is, in essence, a caper book in a science fiction setting. Like most soundbites, that doesn't remotely adequately explain it.The world is vibrant and real in a way that most sci fi universes aren't. The writing is crisp, with excellent dialogue, unselfconsicously witty banter, and a solid plot. As a bonus, it features a pair of antagonists (Mohammed Vance and Melissa Du Bois) who are sympathetic characters rather than villains.And, even having been written two decades ago, Moran manages to capture existential horror in four words: "The network was down."Read it. Just trust me on this one. Read it.
A1B8XON9JLBMND	1	1	I've used these 770SW's while traveling since they came out and love them. Most compact digitals break within a year - dropped, rained on, whatever. This is the answer, waterproof and drop-proof while relatively inexpensive. I've used it whitewater rafting on the Chatooga, body surfing in Puerto Escondido, mountianbiking in Moab, and in bars. It takes pretty good snapshots, and the "available light" setting is nice when you would avoid using a flash. Underwater images is not the reason to purchase, durability is.four out of five stars because, as all compact digitals, the priority is on mexapixel count and not sensor size where it should be. 7 megapixels is good, however a adding a few millimeters to the dimensions of the sensor would do much to improve its performance.
A1B8XON9JLBMND	0	1	I switched to these after multiple flats while riding through the french quarter/downtown new orleans. i have less than 150 miles on them, they are new, and the back tire has multiple micro slits, one serious puncture, two significant slits that i believe will soon join together and effectively end the tire's life. this is very few miles and they have fallen apart, much of the road hazard is broken tempered glass from car windows, old cobble streets, potholes and street car tracks. admittedly its a tough town, and they are not exactly designed for urban use, and i dont say another tire would have held out better. I am going to try continental gatorskin tires next, but i feel like these ought to be directly comparable.I do like the feel of the tire, the traction.
A1B8XON9JLBMND	1	1	the binding seems to hold up well through a full reading and multiple reference readings. even in my back pocket while biking around you dont see page losses, just some minor bends. I generally like the construct.:)
A1B8Y5EQIAH7D1	1	1	Thanks to all the nay-sayers, I kept my expectations really low. But after receiving it and putting it together, I was convinced I got a really good deal (on sale for $18 with free ship) and I think the desk/chair is GREAT! I had just bought a similar type of desk/2-chair combo from walmart and paid $100 for it and I had to pick it up myself! Now THAT was a really disappointing purchase! Theirs was cheap and not sturdy at all. So I didn't expect much from this purchase but couldn't pass up a good deal. Also, it was shipped amazingly fast, holidays or not. I ordered it one day and 3-4 days later, it was at my door.I was immediately pleasantly surprised since I expected some fake/shoddy material, but it is real wood (I'm not sure what material the other desk is - but it's not wood). I put it together in less than 30 mins. My son took to it right away and loved the paper and drawer (walmart's desk doesn't have a drawer). Colors are pretty bright but I don't mind it - after all, it's kid's stuff, right?I think this is the size to be expected from toddler's furniture. I didn't know this when I got the walmart desk thinking it was SO tiny, but now I realize that it's the right size for tots. OK, so they should probably change the age group in the description but for my 3 yr old, it's the same size as his desk/chair at dayschool and is perfect. I'm thinking it should say 2-4 yrs. The chair is steady enough for me to sit on (uncomfortably but it's not crashing underneath me like some reviews had me believe).
A1B8Y5EQIAH7D1	0	0	After a little over a year, my Kindle went ka-put. I've charged it and tried turning it on and get nothing. Not even a light or error message of some sort. I (literally) bought into the whole Oprah rave and fell for the $50 off special at the time. I bought one online book to start, which I never even finished before I found out that it just stopped working. The only things I did find convenient with it was the fact that I could lay sideways and read without having to fold or awkwardly manage a book. But let's face it, if I'm already in that position, I'm falling asleep in 5 mins, which is normally what happened. The other thing I liked was the look-up on any word I wanted, but I could have just kept a dictionary nearby.So having said all that, I realized in this (very expensive) exercise, that I'm a traditionalist. I love going thru actual books and flipping pages. If I liked them, they're mine forever and I can get to them anytime I want. If not, I can still get a bit of money back from them at the local Half-Priced Books. The Kindle always felt fragile to me. One small move and I'm bounding pages forward or back. The book cover for it was awful, and it would never stay in place.I've contacted customer support to see if there's any kind of warranty or replacement part or even sympathy that could be offered to my dead Kindle...but to no avail.
A1B8Y5EQIAH7D1	0	1	i usually love this product from loreal. and was excited that it was sold at a great price...but this will be a lesson on getting what you pay for! you can immediately tell this product was an older expired version product just on the smell that comes with cosmetic items that have been sitting on a shelf for a long time. (i have a legit version of it that has a pleasant smell). i tried to look for an expiration or ANY date on the box but couldn't find it. the box alone should have been a red flag as i think it's an older box. so i'm not sure if the contents are even effective anymore, just has a strong rancid "old" smell. but the annoying smell of the product will be a constant reminder that i went for a cheap price and not quality.
A1B8ZE1586IVVH	0	0	VISTA! OK that's not so bad but a WEI of 5? Thats just horrible. In order to have a WEI of 5 is crazy. Without that score, the game just doesn't want to play smoothly. Make sure you have a good graphics card and CPU to play this game. The games graphics aren't even that good. Why it demands so much makes me wonder...
A1B8ZE1586IVVH	1	1	This pack is great with many essential items for the Gameboy Advance SP. It includes a FM tuner and other fun add-ons. Not the best pack but is a great buy
A1B8ZE1586IVVH	1	1	Perfect for sharing your music! The individual sound control is a great addition. Nice product at the price.
A1B8ZE1586IVVH	1	1	I have been through everything with this shoe. Hiking, rover rafting, and my school. The only gripe is that the shoe is a heavy but it makes a great look with black Volcom crew socks and a pair of Dicky's shorts.
A1B8ZE1586IVVH	1	1	I just got this game even though it is so old. I played this game on the old xbox years ago with my cousins and thought the gameplay was excellent. I thought it would be cool to revisit the path and buy the game to play with my cousins again. It did not disappoint. A classic hack and slash that will take hours trying to find a the goodys and secret passages. The bosses are cool and even though the game is old, the graphics don't disappoint. I really think it is a must have in your collection if you are a fan of RPG's and the old hack and slash. One thing to remember is make sure you have friends to play with. This game is not as fun alone and can get boring at times by yourself. The game disc even has the phrase "Best Played Together!" right in the middle.
A1B90KEO07VV6J	0	0	I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs. One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys. I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided. On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them. In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls. By three hours there were no treats left in either of them. Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too. The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room. I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name.
A1B90KEO07VV6J	1	1	I have two large dogs and two cats, and not one of them will sit like a little angel so you can brush their teeth. One of my dogs was beginning to get serious scale build up on her back molars despite my attempts to clean them, dental chews, and other "miracle cures". My other dog has always had very clean teeth, but they were beginning to yellow with old age. The cats are both young and haven't had any noticeable buildup yet, but I was tired of fighting them to clean their teeth. I read some reviews and decided to give this product a try, and I am so glad I did. I used 1 scoop a day for both of the cats, and my little girl with pretty good teeth, and used the max dose for my big baby with the less than sparkling smile. Within a week I noticed a difference, not a big one, but enough to keep me interested. After about a month I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself. Everyone has beautiful white teeth, and much better breath! The scale is completely gone off the back molars, and even my older dog with yellowing teeth has a brighter whiter doggy grin! It does seem expensive, but the scoop is tiny and 1 180g bottle has lasted me about 2 months. And for what it's saving me in vet cleanings time and energy it is well worth what I paid! Everyone still likes their food, and I haven't noticed any side effects in any of my pets. If there is a wonder product out there, in my opinion this is it!
A1B93ZGGULEMAW	0	0	I finished this book, but afterwards I have to wonder why. The characters were trite, the plot was juvenile, and the science in the science fiction was ludicrous. I hadn't had much experience with Zahn and I could forgive him for joining in writing the Star Wars crap (which along with Star Trek is ruining the SF genre), He seems to be a decent writer with some skill, but this was embarassing. If you want to read some real SF then try some of the British writers like Banks and Hamiliton.
A1B93ZGGULEMAW	1	1	The current crop of British sf writers have restored my faith in SciFi. Hamilton, Asher, Morgan, Banks, et all produce superior stories, tech, and characters. The American debut of Gridlinked doesn't disappoint as Asher really delivers the goods with this story of revenge, xenoc explorations, a hi-tech universe and enough action to really get your heart pumping. What a refreshing change after so much of the mindless drivel that passes for Science Fiction these days, especially the Star Wars series, Star Trek , Honor Harrington and all the rest that passes itself off as scifi. Am I just ranting or do other's feel this way?
A1B93ZGGULEMAW	1	1	While some of the same characters remain from SS, the story has a much different feel. The addition of Wednesday added a whole new dimension, because she's someone we can identify with. Frank the Nose presents another cynical galaxy weary character that I especially identified with. The ReMastered are great villians and remind me of Stirling's Drakon. The plot's a good one that has the characters racing against a deadline to save a billion people. The humor is there although this is a more serious story that Singularuty. A great read and another great English Sci-Fi writer. Is there something in the water over there or maybe the beer?
A1B93ZGGULEMAW	0	0	I feel kind of ripped off. I thought this was more conventional sci-fi adventure, but when the hero writes an equation in a college classroom proving intelligent design I went, uh oh. First there was no explanation of the equations, no science, it was just posited as if by magic. The whole concept of science proving there is only one ordained possible future is silly and made it very hard for me to take this seriously or even with a modicum of interest. The other part of the book dealing with the harsh world for women in Saudi Arabia was better done, but the characters seemed just that, not real people. If I could get my money back on this book I would.
A1B9628PGNS29A	0	0	I ordered this 2 months ago and the second time it was used, all the air leaked out and our houseguests ended up sleeping on the rock-hard floor all night. What a hunk of junk! I would have thought that the more expensive AeroBed would hold up better than most cheaply-made knock-off brands.I contacted Amazon about a refund and since it's been more than 30 days I can't get my money back. Fair enough. HOWEVER, the customer service guy was so incredibly helpful, and he said they can exchange the item no problem. He arranged to have a new one sent to me, waived the shipping fee for express delivery, and emailed me a link so I can print a return label and send the defective bed back. The new one will be on my doorstep within a few days and I have 30 days to send the old one back.Hopefully the new bed will hold up better than the old one, but WOW! What service from Amazon!! Thanks, guys!

A1B9628PGNS29A	1	1	There have been several movies made about Joe Strummer but Julien Temple's is unique in its personal touch. Temple was a friend of Strummer's for many years and so had insight into the man behind the music that many people did not have. The movie consists of Joe's life story as told by many friends, acquaintances, fellow artists and others who knew him or were influenced by him over the years. Amazing music, very well put-together, and just a great story about a man who was a huge influence on rock & roll and politics during his time on this earth. Joe was taken from the world too early when he died unexpectedly in December 2002 and after watching this movie one can only wonder what more he would have accomplished. The opening scene of Joe singing "White Riot" a capella in the studio is complemented by the closing scene of Joe and Mick Jones reuniting on stage 20+ years later to perform the same song...even though they were old (and Mick a little bald!) they still ROCKED. If you like the Clash, you must see this movie!!
A1B9628PGNS29A	0	0	We ordered this for my son who broke his arm and has a cast from the hand to above the elbow. We carefully measured his arm as instructed and ordered the size medium (for a 5-year-old boy) and when it arrived I was SHOCKED at how small the opening is and how BIG the hand part is!! His arm circumference is tiny and I could BARELY squeeze the thing over the cast...the opening is freaky small and there is no way this would fit over an adult arm. After much struggling we got it on, then realized that the "mitten" part of the cast cover is HUGE and is like a giant floppy mit over his hand. I carefully pumped the air out of it as instructed, and it seemed to seal over his arm, but when he BARELY moved one inch the seal was broken. Tried it a few more times...same result. It cracks me up that they show a woman in a swimming pool on the package...there is just no way you could go swimming with this thing on. He seriously moved his arm one inch and the seal was broken. So, between the freaky small opening that I had to jam over his cast, the gigantic mitt of a hand (by the way, that's why the boy in the ad is holding it in his other hand...to hide how big it really is), and the fact that it doesn't seal worth a damn, this product is completely worthless. The only reason I gave it even one star is because Amazon was great about processing my refund quickly when I sent it back.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	I first bought this album in 1965. This is an incredible piece by two incredible artist. Harry Belafonte had been around for years, but it was when he brought Miriam Makeba back from South Africa around 63 or 64, did we begin appreicate the musical messages these people gave to the world. In this CD Harry and Miriam come together and form a musical duo that explores the joys, woes, and turmoil going on in South Africa back at that time. The very first song, back in 65, captivated my mind, which was children seeing a moving train for the first time and emanating the sound. Beautiful sound, or the one where the children are warning their mother of the police coming and telling her to hide; don't let them catch you. I didn't know what was going on in South Africa back then, but the music had an impact and still does.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	Good Times, second season seem to deal with more issues that are real and part of everyday life.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This is a moving and touching film. I wish all young Americans, black, white, Hispanic, or Asian can see the reality of knowing how to read and write were for African-Americans back at that time. Maybe they'd appreciate it more and not take for granted, what others in the past vied for and could lose their lives if they had it.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This is a must-see movie for everyone. It highlights 9 African-American celebrities, who's face we see in movies, television, and hear in music, as well as people who're not in the public eye as much. A revealing look into the past of so many prominent people of our day.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	When I was 15 I bought an album called Hip Hits. I knew nothing about Quincy Jones, except that I liked the music and this was around 1963. But, when i saw his name popping-up as a composer in such movies as The Carpetbaggers, In The Heat of the Night, did I began to learn about Quincy Jones. He was the first black musician who composed music themes, but also was music direct for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, The Brothers Johnson, and of course, Michael Jackson.Quincy is the last of his breed and this book also gives acolades to other great musicians, who are long gone and unknown to many young music lovers. This is a good chance to get to know them.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	It was the beginning, after so many years of degraded parts and smiling, minstrial-type characters, the 70's brought us new hope and new faces on the screen that we could identify with. Sweet, sweet-back, Superfly, Shaft, and The Mack brought true-to life characters that were what we wanted to be; they were the ones who got away with what none of us could.This incredible era is depected in this magnificent film, which shows, how, who, and why these films were made and just as quickly faded away. A must have for anyone who was around at that time.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This book was a gift to a friend behind, bars, but he ssaid it was excellent and worth-while reading. People don't realize we spent ten of thousands of dollars keeping people behind bars, who're only someday (except in rare cases) will be released and what do we do with them? This book gives some insight.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	The journey began with the likes of Steppin' Fechit', Eddie Rochester, and Man Tan Moreland, all big-eyed, shuffling, dancing, which caused great embarrassment to African-Americans, but little did they know that Steppin' Fechit" and Eddie Rochester were inteligent men, who enjoyed fame and fortune, to the dismay of many. However, they opened doors for such actors and actresses as Lena Horne, Bill Jojangles Robinson, Harry Belafonte, and Sidney Poitier. This shows the strides and sacrifices that were made on and off the big screen.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	0	0	The CD I received, was not the one shown here. It was with white gospel singers and a few blacks, but it was not what I ordered. However, the one depicted here is old time gospel, which I wish I could have.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This is a great CD. My wife introduced me to Joe Simon in 1969 and I've been a fan since then. The old songs brings back memories and I totally enjoyed this CD. Great!
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	0	0	The Black 6, about a gang of black, vietnam vets who fight racism in a southern town, after one of their brothers was killed was very phony. The Klansman I expected more from Lee marvin and OJ Simpson. Needless to say both movies were horrible! I would not recommend it.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This should be required viewing in public schools across America, because so many of our young people aren't aware of the struggles, brutalities, and often-times murders African-Americans suffered trying to get to the promised land. Through the beginning in 1955, with the murder of Emit Till we see how African-American withstood oppression and racial injustice, struggling for a right that they'd earned through wars, labor, and citizenship since the first slaves landed in Jamestown.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	You don't see anything like this on TV! This is a rare look into the lives of 3 young, African-american teenagers who's surviving on their own! Both parents are deceased and it's up to the 3 brothers to survive in a world of turmoil.Ty'ree, 20 who turned down an opportunity to attend MIT, to look after his younger siblings is a boy you would want to date your daughter; Charlie, 16, just out of juvenile correctional facility for robbing a store, is trying to find is way back and re-integrate into society finds it difficult because he's wearing a badge of honor he doesn't want; Lafayette, 14, is a lovable character who's caught in the middle and is trying his damnest to master baseball, a game he's not so good at.Through controversy and turmoil this film gives the viewer a glimpse into a window the world didn't know exist.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	I can't go a day without watching Judge Judy. I program it to my DVD from my office. She's not like any other judge and this book gives us a glimpse into the judicial system she worked for so many years.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	It happens more often then we'd like to imagine and it's a parents night-mare, but many young boys fall prety to older men and it sticks! This is the story of one ball who is seduced by a camp counselor, but the boy himself becomes gay and later-on confronts his abuser. Good book with a lot of humor and insight.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	George Chuvalo, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Henry Cooper, Ron Lyle, Ernie Shavers, and more all fought Ali at one time. Now, they all come together to tell us what it was like and how they felt about the most famous and charismatic boxer in history.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	0	0	I wasted my money and time on this movie. It's phony and the plots, to me goes nowhere. I like Steve Austin as a wrestling-entertainer, but as far as acting, he should stick to what he knows. I would not recommend this.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	I always wondered about this man, whom I've been reading about for years. this book gives you wondeerful insight into how Johnson Publication, one of the first black companies became so successful and the odds against him. Interesting reading.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	Young boys snatched up and made to dress-up like women and dance for pedophile men, who often sexually abuse these young kids; some of them end up being murdered. It's a horror, but this movie gives us a glimpse into a world beyond us. Highly recommended.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	I loved this documentary, but I love Muhammad Ali. I had no idea that Miami had such an impact on his career and the interesting things that this entailed, will give young viewers an idea what was going on at that time. I would recommend this to anyone.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	I read this book years ago and just hd to have it. It's a great book about a young, black boy who is sexually abused by a church deacon and winds-up a gay man who's trying to find his way. Great book!
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	When I first saw this on television about 20 years ago, I couldn't help but shed some tears. You can't help but love this life-form that they never intended for it to be human or to be with humans. But, Daryl is more than just a robot, he's human and lovable and anyone, regardless of age will fall in love with him.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	This is a great slice of history, from reconstruction up to the present time. Marable outlines details of the goings on within our society and ways in which we have over-came barriers. Great book!
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	When I saw this it reminded me of my family and how families came together, no matter what problems we had, we all shared. This is a great for Chris Brown who I thought played a great part as Baby. Highly recommended for family viewing.
A1B9D5E8FYJHUN	1	1	Remembering the days of the late and middle 70's, this is a reminder for some of us the way the world was at that time and the mentality of people like Archie Bunker. And, also a reminder of what a great actor Acrroll O'Connor was. I love this series and would recommend it to anyone.
A1B9FVZNV5I783	1	1	Just pulled this baby out of the box and had one of the best smoothies ever! I like how this blender disassembles and is very easy to clean. It is also a very powerful blender that crushes ice or frozen fruit with the utmost of ease. Enjoy!
A1B9FVZNV5I783	1	1	As a novice cigar smoker I desperately needed some guidance on how to properly pursue my new hobby. I found this book to be extremely helpful and plan to keep it around as a reference book for many years. Editorial errors are all that kept this from 5 stars for me but the content was outstanding!
A1B9G9MUZFNS8X	0	1	The master of horror and oddly fantastic worlds has underdone himself with Galilee. It is a fasinating story of two warring families that leads the reader into thinking that there is going to be a catastrophic battle, all in the name of love. The story drags on and on with promisses of war, death and destruction but to which none ever happens. The book is filled with all sorts of information, past and present, and takes the reader through the ages of time but does little in what we expect to happen. I was hooked for the first half of the book but then I just wanted to finish it. Read it if you are a Barker fan but be forewarned that it is NOT what you are used to. It could have been condensed and made shorter and I think the author ran out of material to work with in the end. I would compare this novel to Rose Madder by Stephen King but Rose Madder is a better read.
A1B9G9MUZFNS8X	1	1	This is a great book. From the start you are engrossed in the story and will keep turning the pages until you have run out of time or reached the end of the book. The story line takes a suprising twist that is sure to have your imagination working in overdrive. The main character will make you laugh with his wit and his private thoughts. I grew very attached to the characters and wished the book was longer. I would like to see Mr. Deville put John Corey in more of his future books. This is a character that needs to have more adventures.
A1B9K8DAVMUWRW	0	0	Disgraceful take on the classic horror comic book is a travesty of the highest order. I would love to meet the idiot who actually thought that Keanu Reeves was a great choice for the role of John Constantine, one of the most complex figures in modern pop literature. His bad performance is the perfect middle finger to the fans and creators of the comic book series who wanted a quality production of their favorite comic book character. The rest of the film is tailor made to give Keanu free reign to totally screw up with a script so badly written that you can see how embarrass some of the actors are in saying some of the dialog and a director who does not have a clue on how to stage a scene. The special effects are of low standard and the cinematography does not give off the right feel. The movie does have a few shining moments with Rachel Weisz giving this film more class and dignity than it deserved with a powerhouse performance that deserved a better film that this and Djimon Hounsou, who's game performance is a fitting tribute to the comic book character he is playing. I don't know why the movie trait so for a way from the comic because if they at least stay true to the comic's core, it would have been a great film but with the egos involved in Hollywood who think they know more than the fans or the creators of this comic do, we have this piece of garbage
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	0	0	It's basically remakes of some of Telex's classic tracks in a techno style.... Far behind the original sound, I wasn't able to recognize most of the tracks without looking at the sleeve to check the titles. !
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	1	1	Well, basically, this is the first time the full &quot;Telephone Mama&quot; album is released on CD along with 6 additional tracks which include instrumentals and single edits. the real Gazebo fanatic will probably want to buy also Gazebo's self-titled album also available on CD .So to be short, it's certainly on of the best italo disco stuff available, still highly enjoyable even now and Gazebo's voice is very nice and romantic. btw, the sound quality is excellent, they did a good job on this one.
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	1	1	Since this compilation is the only one retracing about 20 years of Moroder's carrer, it's best than nothing, but it's certainly not enough for the real fan who will have to search for vinyls LP's. But it's a good choise. the tracks are in their correct chronologic order and their choice is quite good. However, let me correct an error from the Amazon site: &quot;love affair&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Bad times&quot; are * not * included on the CD. So overal, this is a nice Moroder compilation but I hope Repertoire Records will continue to reissue Moroder stuff.
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	1	1	I wonder how non french people could have ever heard of JP Capdevielle's music, anyway, if you heard &quot;Quand t'es dans le d&eacute;sert&quot; or other Capdevielle song from the early 80's, or if you'd like to hear a good sample of typical french 80's rock, this CD is for you. Afew excellent tracks are missing from this compilation, but it's an introduction to Capdevielle's music, and if you want more, you will have to dig Capdevielle original LP's, never released on CD btw, except &quot;Les enfants des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres&quot;.
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	0	0	Don't get me wrong, I'm a big John Foxx / Ultravox! fan, but this album was a real mistake in my opinion.The songs are just pathetic and Foxx's energy is not there, I think he was quite borred with music in the mid 80's.So, unless you're a John Foxx completist, just forget this album, it's really forgettable
A1B9PPNU9QZV58	0	0	This is disappointing.It's not real Jazz, it's not electronic music too.It's a kind of mixture,and for people who may like Telex and thing this could resemble Telex in any way, don't waste your time.
A1BA2A7CSUWEW6	1	1	That's all she wrote. This watch is just beautiful yet very masculine. And it's a Bulova at a great price!
A1BA2A7CSUWEW6	1	1	bought as a christmas present for my dad and it was exactly what he wanted. Perfect for his Harley and he also bought the cradle for the car. Something I didn't realize, you can actually load music & pictures onto it. VERY NICE!
A1BA2A7CSUWEW6	1	1	As a fan of Jackie's tv show on BravoTV, I had to have this dvd! And I'm so glad that I got it. It's broken into 3 separate 20 minute workouts (which all include a warm up & stretch) upper body, lower body, and core. The dvd has a feature that allows you to choose which one, or two, or you can do all three... IF you can handle it. I work out regularly, and I couldn't do all three in one viewing (I tried). But, to get myself motivated for the day, I chose one workout, and then I go for a jog and walk around the neighborhood for more cardio. I do this 3 days a week, one day for each of her workouts, and the other 2 days I weight train with kettlebells. I highly suggest this DVD to compliment any workout routine!
A1BA2A7CSUWEW6	1	1	These may not work as an effective "appetite suppressant" for me, BUT, they seriously take between 45 minutes to 1 hour to finish!!! That is great for me because they keep my mouth busy and I'm not thinking of snacking all day. Also, by the time I finish one, I have to wait to eat anyways just because the sweet taste is still in my mouth and therefore keeps me satisfied for another 30min to an hour later =) Well, then maybe they are an appetite suppressant. LOL I ordered the assorted flavors pack because I wasn't sure what I was in for. Initially, I thought I wanted to order just watermelon. Glad I didn't, it was nasty! My favorite flavors ended up sup rising me: cappuccino, candy cane, root beer float (I normally HATE root beer anything). I also love the cherry (taste like Luden's cough drops) and the grape. Interesting side effect: I've cut back on the smoking!
A1BAZ4RLP2921E	1	1	THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST YET!!! This is a great game you can play for hours. You can customize your folks' with your family and friends!

You can create a DRAGON!! that will eat people's pets that bother you!!! This was sooooo funny!!!YOU WILL LOVE THIS UPGRADE!!!!!Jess
A1BAZ4RLP2921E	1	1	Being a avid werewolf fan I also bought this book cause of the cool cover. Gary does an excellent job making you care deeply for the the main Characters (Kyna and Cyrus). I did not want to finish the book and just wanted it to keep going and never end. I have searched for another book that would stand up to this one as far as the werewolf part and romance. I have not found one yet.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	1	0	An amazing CD by an amazing band. I had never heard of Tunnels but went to hear them play because of my huge admiration of Percy Jones. I was a big fan of Brand X--but this is different. Tunnels is a total collaborative effort between Percy and the incredible Marc Wagnon. His midi-vibes squeak, honk, rumble, and are everywhere at once.All three studio Tunnels CD's have something to offer but this live CD gives you a taste of everything this incredible band has to offer. You will be pleasantly SHOCKED.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	1	1	I'm a recent introductee to Delbert--I'd heard his name for many years, maybe knew a composition or two, but it wasn't until a guy auditioning for my band played me some of his stuff that I got locked down tight. What's his magic? He's not a great singer, but the emotion comes through. His songs are not all that original, but they all seem to have a funny, unexpected hook.I determined that, in the end, it all came down to the sound and the band. Simply put, Delbert's band wails. Rocks. Shrieks. Use any superlative you like. This is a rhythm-based band, and Rob McNelley (guitar), Lynn Williams (drums) and especially George Hawkins (bass) are staggering. Try listening to "Leap of Faith", "I Wanna Thank You Baby", or "Smooth Talk" while driving your car and see if you can keep it on the road.And Delbert obviously adores these musicians. Loves them, and loves performing. It shows all over this album.This isn't the greatest live album ever (try "Live Cream") but it's rock-solid.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	0	1	Well, Dennis' wife loved this stuff, but it is incomprehensible and unreadable to the rest of us.Amazon tells us that about 5 copies of this book are for sale used. Those must be all 5 sold.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	1	1	The funniest show on television. Simple as that. I had heard of Arrested Development but had never seen it until my college student son turned me onto it, and I was dead meat 30 seconds into the pilot. I'll leave all the synopses, descriptions to everyone else and just point this out: with the possible exception of The Simpsons, this is the only series I know of that will have you laughing just as hard on the tenth viewing as it did on the first.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	1	1	I saw Mike and his California quintet at the Baked Potato in LA about 3 years ago. I had never heard of him, I actually went to see Chad Wackerman and Jimmy Johnson from Holdsworth's trio who were playing with him. I was simply killed. Mike's got to be one of the most imaginative, original guitarists anywhere. His playing is unique and defies description. This CD is a pretty good representation of his sound. He actually wails a little bit harder live but that's my only complaint.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	0	1	I challenge any literate person to force himself to read one page of this incomprehensible nonsense.
A1BAZJRTSH208E	1	0	Sorry to be so cliched, but "you had to be there." I was 13 in 1964 and I can't describe what these short, beautiful songs meant to me. There was such thoughtfulness, optimism and LIFE. Thanks, boys!
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	I know I will get flamed or ridiculed for this opinion, but Spartacus: Blood and Sand is probably the better and more historically accurate version that is the legend of Spartacus. Yes, the violence is over the top with the 300ish style. Yes, the sex is VERY over the top and would be considered more pornographic than anything released theatrically (especially more so than USA director cuts). But when it boils down to a depiction about the savagery of gladiators and the outlandish lifestyle of the Roman empire, this show does nail it. Nothing is held back and the viewer needs to have an open mind when watching Blood and Sand. However, anybody easily offended by bodily mutilation and sexual display NEED to stay away.As I have informed many people about this show, the first episode is the most difficult to get by. It's painfully awful cheesy. Then almost immediately during the second episode, the show gets better. After the 5th, it becomes a very enticing historical drama. The life of the Roman gladiator is the real treat as you watch Spartacus forget his past and become a Legend in the Capua Arena. In my opinion, the best part of this TV series is that this story is more accurate than the famous 1960 film. If one were to watch this entirely, then go and do quick research, the viewer would understand that the writers did in fact do their research, even though still very dramatized.I would prefer nothing else but to own a Blu-ray release of this series. Anything below 720p for this show would never be enough to display the wonderful performances of the actors and the brilliant cinematography. Even though I watched this on Netflix, this is on my Amazon wish list to own very soon. It is of course a sad note to the late Andy Whitfield. Spartacus: Blood and Sand is officially his acting legacy. But what he left is an unforgettable performance and a story of Spartacus that made me anticipate the next series: Vengeance, with high anticipation. Entertainment fans of historical dramas particularly of the Roman Empire should not scoff or miss this.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	Back in 2008, my friends thought I was absolutely nuts for only wanting a Playstation 3 to own and play the conclusion to one of my favorite video game characters of all time; Solid Snake. It's 2012 now, I finally purchased a new PS3 with a bigger hardrive and I installed Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and started playing once again. 3 hours later, I've come to the decision that this game is still the masterpiece I remember it back then.The graphics get a 5 out of 5. The sound gets a 10/10. The game play gets a 100/100. The over all work of Hideo Kojima and the at the time development team at Konami just gets a #$%@ing Platinum medal, or deserves one. This game showed what the PS3 could do compared to the XB360 in terms of graphical power and massive content within Blu-Ray based games. And to tell you the truth, 3 to 4 years later, it still shows it.I personally think the current price for this game is outlandish, because it self is worth a full retail price for the sheer amount of content that is packaged into the Blu-ray disc. However, I understand because it's 3 to 4 years old now. The only and I mean ONLY people who would think other wise would be you avid Gears of War or Call of Duty fanboys or fangirls. Yes, I absolutely mean it. If you never enjoyed MGS 1, 2, or 3, stay the hell away, and go back to your 2 to 5 hour single player/built only for multiplayer games.However, if you were a MGS fan from the early days of the PS1, played the PS2 releases, and the PSP games, then this is the official magnum opus from the Metal Gear Solid franchise. The only complaint that I will point out against MGS4 are the cut scenes. They are long and there are many for a still confusing story. But this is what is expected when you play a Metal Gear Solid game. What still remains is one of the most innovative stealth action games money can buy. Just play with the Octocammo and see what I mean.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	I don't want to start a "who plays the best Batman" argument going with this review. That is not the case here. Let me be clear that for the first time ever in movie format, the writers for Batman Begins FINALLY got Bruce Wayne's parents murder correct. I know that sounds strange, but it means a lot if you are a Batman fan. It was not the Joker or Harvey Dent who fueled Bruce becoming the Dark Knight. It was a thief... how hard was that to get right? Aside from that, this origin story is believable with the present day setting and almost to the point of "wow, this could actually happen." The best part of this film is the minimal use of CGI. Of course the bats, parts of the train, and some of Gotham was CGI integrated, but still very believable looking. The Bat-mobile or Tumbler tank was a real treat to see. the amazing notion is that it actually exists and you couldn't help yourself with saying "I want one!"Another plus is there is an awesome amount of A-list actors and actresses in this film. All are wonderful performance with making a Batman story come to life scene after scene. The only problem I had with the movie were some new character additions like Rachel Dawes as a main character. But Katy Holmes performance was good so I immediately didn't mind her being in it. I know that people particularly Batman fans and non fans alike questioned the voice Christan Bale used. I just wish people would understand why. Unlike George Clooney's (gags self) or Michael Keaton's performances, you wouldn't talk in your normal voice if trying to hide your real identity and invoking fear into thugs. You want to mask your voice and sound intimidating. It did get questionable in The Dark Knight sequel, but I just wish people would get over this stupid hump. Watch the bonus features for the making of Batman Begins and watch Christian Bale perform. You will understand why he was chosen to be Batman.The influences from various comic book source material is apparent. Most of the ideas like the famous bat swarm scene is from Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Year One mini series. Anyway, Batman Begins is worth a Blu-Ray price for 720 to 1080p resolution and High Definition surround sound. It's a must own for Batman or action movie fans.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	Please note that I did in fact grow up with watching and loving the Tim Burton Batman movies. After atrocities called Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I convinced myself the only good Batman stories will either be animated or in comic books. In my opinion, the best Batman in visual format is the Animated Series from the 1990s. Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of the Batman, and Mark Hamil will and always be the Joker. However, for a theatrical and more realistic view of the Legend of the Dark Knight, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.I would write a long review of why I think my title sums it up, but I'll just go by the stars:1 star for being the amazing Christopher Nolan directed sequel of my favorite comic book superhero.1 star for the amazing performances of all of the actors and actresses. Yes even the Christian Bale growl I liked. What? you have to mask your voice! Shush! He's Batman! grrrr! Heath Ledger will forever be remembered as this Joker. More so than Jack Nicholson (oh no the blasphemy oh!)If the Joker was to exist, this has got to be it. I couldn't take my eyes off of him watching this at the theater.1 star for how this was made. Barley any CGI. This movie was just created so freaking well.1 star that this is what a Blu-Ray disc is all about: 720 and 1080p resolution High Definition Sound quality.1 star for.. I'm not sure, it's a very #$%@ing great suspenseful action movie.I would pay whatever price for this movie if I don't already have it. Well, not a Best Buy or Barnes 'n Noble new release price, but $19.99 or $9.99 totally worth owning one of the best Batman and Blu-Ray releases ever!
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	Archer is in its 3rd season as I type this and it's still, if not, better than the previous two seasons. But this review is for season 1 because it was fantastic. I read that some reviewers commented about the DVD extras suck. Seriously? You would rate it down for that. The show alone gets 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10 or 100 out of 100 because it's so damned hilarious. I'm not sure why this didn't exist before. Oh yeah, Frisky Dingo. Meh, I'll stick with Archer. Voices are great, the animation is stiff but you get used to it immediately, because it's about what the characters say and the situations they put themselves in that makes Archer so damned fun to watch.Totally worth the price for multi viewings with friends or alone. There are so many hilarious quotes in this show.Archer: "Lana. Lana. Lana! LAAAAAAANNNAAAAAAAAA!"Lana: "WHAT!?"Archer: "Danger zoooone!"If you can't find this show one bit hilarious, something is wrong with you. Just saying.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	Holy crap, $34.99 right now on Amazon.com? This is going to be the best Blu-ray deal for a long time. Fans of the Book series and the TV show, please do not miss out on HBO's finest in epic adult fantasy storytelling. Blu-Ray High Def is going to be the best way to watch this show. The best thing about Game of Thrones season 1? Anticipating season 2 a month later! :D
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	0	0	...oh wait, it's called Archer! Seriously though, I only watched this thinking "yay! a new prime time cartoon to try out besides the Simpsons and Family Guy." Welp, it sucked. Every episode I tried watching just sucked and was very dry on the humor. Besides the main attraction here, voices are really bad, especially the wife's. Animation is equally terrible too with it looking just plain ugly. I mean there was nothing creative or quirky here to keep my interest till I change the channel every time it came on. After you watch Archer where H. Jon Benjamin truly shines as great and humorous voice actor, Bob's Burgers becomes a very stale left over McDonald's burger left on the warmer all day.I would rather watch the live action Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode over Bob's Burgers any day.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	I Saw this on opening night which was also on my birthday. So viewing it was extra special since Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time. A Blu-ray release will be a definite must because the cinematography was superb in this movie. The alien world and ship(s) settings are remarkably beautiful and felt real. The acting was top notch with kudos to Michael Fassbender being the most memorable. The beautiful Noomi Rapace and seriousness of Charlize Theron also helped push Prometheus narrative as well. Of course, the hate comments I read after this movie was released make it not perfect, as usual:"this is not a direct Alien sequel, but only based in the universe." Duh, we knew this from the beginning, Why is this hump hard to get over, dumb metacritic reviewer?Scientific fact nerds will be nit picky... even though we know it's a sci-fi film. Do we really need to point out every great sci-fi films problems? The movie is set in the future and on out of this world ideas. Just Go with it!The story was cliched and predictable, even though, wait, why are these guys lost? Okay that doesn't make sense, but oh well.My biggest problem and the only constructive argument that I agreed on was, what exactly does the main plot device actually do? In Alien, the xenomorph monster was easy to understand. In Prometheus, Ridley Scott and writers loaded the black goo monster mechanic into a plot shotgun and shot the effects everywhere making it hard to figure out what exactly is the menace here. So Scott's films of the past, it seems that a need for a director's cut is in need.So with that in mind, this may not be THE copy of Prometheus to own at the time. However, I still liked what I watched and I beleive that of all the movies releases lately with a director's commentary, this may be the one if you are seeking possible answers to questions of the film.. It did suck me back into the Weyland/Utani cooperate future of the Alien universe. That certain setting I love to see where once again, they make things more dangerous for human life than they intended. For a recently released sci-fi film of the past five years, this is still a great theatrical viewing. Not perfect like District 9, but entertaining nonetheless.
A1BB4H9G9APMT3	1	1	The title says it all. We just now entered the mid season break and I must say that I am anticipating the final 8 episodes for this season. The story pacing is 10x faster than season two (STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENS). We finally get fan favorite characters appearing this season. 4 words: DARYL IS THE MAN. Norman Reedus's character once again proves he is the most useful character of the group. Of course there are gripes, like how dangerous it must be to be a black character surrounded by white people and zombies. Also, David Morrisey's take on the infamous Governor will rub some of the comic fans the wrong way,..then act like he is supposed to, then randomly change.Other than the gripes, The Walking Dead season 3 is a breath of fresh air that was the stagnant previous season. Enjoy it!
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	1	1	I have had this tent up for almost 3 yrs. I only take it down when it snows. I live in Michigan. We have had winds over 80 miles an hour, with hail and rain. This tent stood up to it all!! It is staked down in grass in my back yard, and doesn't move. It also remains dry under the tent. The only thing I would like to see changed is a top air vent (for the 80 mile an hour winds), however then it would no longer be waterproof! LOVE IT LOVE IT!! They make them in Green, Black , Bronze, Red, Blue, and Checkered. I would pay the extra money and get a darker color due to sun glare. :)
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	1	1	I have terriable cystic acne. I have tried everything on the market...then I found this toner. WOW...it really works! It has a very strong nail polish remover smell..but it goes away.
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	0	0	My 3 year old recieved this as a Christmas gift. We aired it up and he used it about 30 mins. Then, we look over and it was deflated. So, we reinflated it again, within 20 mins it was deflated again. My son was so upset that "Santa's" gift was not working. I returned it today.
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	1	0	This is GREAT for 2-5 yrs old just learning how to play ball. The Bat is small, 36 inches long and padded. The ball is soft like a bean bag, and they both glow yellow in the dark.Would not recommend use in or around water.
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	0	0	This item is VERY heavy. If you are purchasing it, and are not a strong man, you could not sit wearing this.Also, another review stated the beads all graviated to the bottom because it is not stitched around the corners. By darn this is totally true. So, you put it on, and all the beads go to the very bottom leaving the rest empty. This could be totally avoided it they would just stitch the beads in small closed squares. Also, you will need a large microwave, and you will need to move it around a few times on high to get it all heated. It took me about 8 mins total in a 1000 watt medium sized microwave. To get most of the beads warmed.I already own one of this company's products I bought over 12 years ago, and have NO problems with the old item. So, I jumped to purchase this, due to the great quality of the old one I have. BIG mistake..I do not recommend until they fix the problems.
A1BBAWO95SUWAL	1	1	LOVE.It is NOT for removing eye makeup. It is for oily adult acne prone skin only. I have old skin but sill have acne. This was the ONLY thing that worked!
A1BBCJ12AOT6QC	1	1	Whether your interest lies with African-American history or African-American art, you must add this book to your library. As Painter tells the story of black people in America from the 15th century to the beginning of the 21st, she illustrates her points with works of art (paintings, sculpture, even quilts) by black Americans. The back of the book includes short profiles of each artist mentioned and a detailed timeline of black history. This book is definitely worth re-visiting many times.
A1BBCJ12AOT6QC	1	0	If you just want to read about your neighborhood, this is not the book for you. With over 40 neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the authors can't provide much depth on any one of them, but manage to offer enough history, architecture, cultural heritage and current status to be a starting point for personal exploration.Including street maps and photographs (vintage and current) makes the book take on "coffee table book" proportions, but the subject and text are more what one would want in a take-along travel guide. I guess I'll just have to bring photocopies of the relevant pages when I take self-guided walking tours of each neighborhood.Now I'm eager both for good weather to tour Brooklyn and a companion book on the "Neighborhoods of Manhattan." (I see "Queens" is already available.)
A1BBCJ12AOT6QC	1	1	I only use this genuine Brother Toner Cartridge in my Brother laser printer. There's no way I'm willing to take a chance on an imitation cartridge failing and destroying my printer -- especially since the price difference is minimal. The High-Yield Cartridge prints way more pages than the 6,500 estimated. This is only my third cartridge in like 5 years. Which is also why I appreciate the step-by-step installation instructions on the package.
A1BBCJ12AOT6QC	0	0	The concept was good -- a deck of cards, each with a neighborhood map on one side and walking tour information on the other. Too bad the execution didn't measure up -- focusing more on shops and restaurants that are bound to be gone in a few years and little on neighborhood history and landmark buildings. A smart phone will be of more use than this guide.
A1BBFVUHN469KY	1	1	Great fun and please watch all the credits. This is a good mix of Campy fun and cartoon (no spurting blood) violence.
A1BBFVUHN469KY	1	1	This is one of our favorite examples of 3D animation we've seen so far. The details, include feather strands within feathers. Highly recommended.
A1BBFVUHN469KY	1	0	There are a lot of classic through the window 3D tricks in this one. I almost broke a plate when the fish flew out at me! However, I think there are way too many gratuitous through-the-window 3D effects (through the window is when something appears to be between the viewer and the screen). I also found the window violations to be too numerous for me (window violations is a through the window effect where part of the through-the-window object is cut off by the edge of the TV screen) something appears to be between the viewer and the screen but is cut off by the side of the screen). IT is OK if something is sticking out at me, but when half a person is sticking out at me, it is too distracting.That being said, my family enjoyed it and would give it 4 stars:)
A1BBPZBIBV4SW9	1	1	I thought this movie was better than the 'run of the mill' movies based on a true event.Boys taken off the streets and herded into the forest, where they were made to work all day...real hard physical work.Guarded by soldiers with guns, who weren't afraid to use them...there was evidence of physical punishment..This one boy (who could write) started a diary...then (with two other boys) planned an escape...The escape went well...'till things started going wrong. I won't mention more, as it may spoil your enjoyment of the movie.Well worth watching
A1BBZZNIZBPTJD	1	1	I love James Patterson books, but the Cross novels are becoming a little predictable, and I think Patterson is losing his hard-hitting edge that was existent in Midnight Club and Kiss The Girls. Still excellent narration, top quality writing and great suspense novels, but not his best.DO! DO! DO! read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas - don't let anyone tell you its a chick book.
A1BBZZNIZBPTJD	0	1	I LOVE Whitney Houston. I think they was once the most talented vocalist of all time. She could sing and make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.But this CD sounds like Destiny's Child's baby sister singing. Nothing against Destiny's Child.If you're looking for a great comeback CD that makes you think &quot;Wow - she's back!&quot; buy Charmbracelet instead.
A1BBZZNIZBPTJD	0	0	i love beyonce and Destiny's Child but this CD is just awful, awful, awful. the songs (yes, everyone one of them) are all over the place. its almost like listening to a CD entirely consisting of chorus and no verse. "Resentment" was the only song that had any potential, but for some reason Beyonce was completely over-sung by the backup singers. Listen to this CD before you buy it!
A1BC369IGW8GO	1	0	PURCHASE DECISIONI bought this unit after I discovered some signs of mold growing on a wooden door slab in my basement. The numerous reviews on this website really helped in my decision as it is highly rated from many reviewers.INSTALLATIONInstallation was a breeze. I took it out of the box and had it running in about 2 minutes.PERFORMANCEIn the first 20 hours, I estimate that it has removed about 8 liters of water from the air in my basement. It alreadys feels noticeably drier down there and I can finally close the door again without slamming it shut.DURABILITYUnsure.ENVIRONMENTThe unit is not overpackaged. There is a single plastic bag covering the unit and four small styrofoam corner supports. Amazon ships this dehumidifier in its factory box, so there is only one cardboard box to recycle.I was a little disappointed that the unit is not Energy Star rated. In fact, there is no mention at all of it on the Energy Star product list. However, after some further research I think this unit would qualify for Energy Star status. Per this link: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=dehumid.pr_proc_dehumidifiers, you can see that a 40 pint dehumidifier should have an energy factor of at least 1.5 L/kWh. The Soleus consumes 330W of energy and removes 40 pints per day. 40 pints = 18.9 liters per day or 0.79 liters per hour. So the energy factor is 0.79 L/0.33kWh = 2.39 L/kWh--much higher than the Energy Star rating of 1.5 L/kWh.
A1BC369IGW8GO	0	1	I tried this antenna to see if it would improve my reception of a couple of HD channels which my Sharp Aquos would not tune. Unfortunately, it turned out that the reception was actually worse with this antenna than with the old-school UHF antenna which I inherited with me house.My impression of the Terk antenna is that it looks nice but feels a bit cheap. (It is extremely lightweight.) Installation was a breeze and there are tons of options to choose from in terms of mounting locations.The return process was easy--as always with Amazon. Someone said you can't close the sides of the antenna once you open them, but this is not true. If you look close to the hinge point you will see the word "PUSH". If you push there, it will release the arms and allow them to be closed.I ended up getting those missing channels by purchasing a Motorola signal amplifier. You can find that on Amazon too and it is amazing. I'm cancelling my cable at the end of the month!!!
A1BC369IGW8GO	1	1	I bought a Sharp Aquos before Christmas and recently started exploring OTA HDTV. When I bought my house there was an antenna in the attic (a classic VHF/UHF antenna), so I hooked that up to the TV to see what channels I could get. Unfortunately, my local Fox affiliate would not tune and my local NBC station was intermittent--they are both about 35-40 miles away.I first tried switching to a "HD" antenna, but this was worse than the classic antenna.Then I hooked up the signal booster. Suddenly, I have all of my locals plus a few I didn't even know existed. The signal is perfect and a lot of the signals are even stronger than what I was getting over a cable from Comcast! I can even now get one station which is located approximately 180 degrees from where the antenna is pointed--although this station is only about 12 miles away.Anyway, at the end of the month I am cancelling my Comcast subscription since I now have crystal clear HD for free!
A1BC369IGW8GO	1	1	I bought the Baby BiOrb about 5 months ago to get my kids interested in fish keeping. We've got a platys and guppy and an oto in the tank plus a single live plant.So far we've been very happy with the aquarium, although I do admit that I now want a bigger one so I can add more fish. We lost one platys recently (we had 2) but I don't think it was due to overcrowding--I suspect he was not 100% well when we got him as he's always been somewhat lethargic and never as social as our other two swimmers. The tank cycled quickly. I do regular ammonia tests and have never tested higher than zero since the second week.I want to add here that I was not a fan of the ceramic media--both for asthetic reasons and because I wanted my plant to have something more substantial to root in. So I bought some coarser gravel at PetCo, added the ceramic media around the perimeter of the filter housing and then added the gravel on the outside of that. I've had no issue with this affecting the ability of the filter to operate.Filter changes are easy but I do recommend getting the gravel vacuum. I lift the filter and then immediately siphon out the water underneath to avoid polluting the tank. I change the filter once a month and I siphon out 1/2 gallon of water per week. It takes about 10 minutes to keep the tank clean.Finally, my plant loves this tank. It started as a little four bladed Lanceolota and now I am pruning it on a regular basis. This is a great plant for beginners and my Oto loves it because the leaves are broad and smooth so he can cling to it easily.You don't need to buy the BiOrb heater--I bought a standard thermostatic heater with suction cups and it works just fine.
A1BC369IGW8GO	1	1	Perfect if you want to use a USB key as a primary hard drive in a low power PC application. Solid state drives are expensive compared to USB drives, but if you want low power consumption you can use this cheap adapter + a USB key to run a PC using Ubuntu or other Linux distro. I paired this adapter with a OCZ 8GB Rally 2 USB 2.0 Dual Channel Flash Memory, which is one of the faster USB devices available in terms of both read and write speed.It has been awesome in my new media server. The entire PC (which uses an Atom processor) consumes ~35W when running under steady load.
A1BC75NV2FH3MQ	1	0	Just got this and noticed that the warranty is not what is stated on Amazon.com. To quote from the warranty statement included with my scanner: "The Product is warranted against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service (a)for a period of one (1)year from the date of original purchase when delivered to you in new condition in its original container or (b)for 90 days from the date of original purchase for refurbished Products."
A1BC75NV2FH3MQ	0	0	This show hasn't stood up well to the test of time. If you've never seen it, save yourself disappointment. If you loved it when you were younger, rent it.I am one of those who loved it when I was younger. I had completely forgotten about the show and when I saw it on DVD I rushed to buy the first set. Now having watched it, I regret buying it.Now I can't help noticing things I didn't notice when I was younger. The bad acting, writing, editing, props, and special effects. Just about everything. Of course a show this old has to be judged by the standard of its day. By that standard it is so-so. Judged by today's standards it's quite bad. Although it's a bit disillusioning to see how bad the show is considering how much I loved it when I was younger, I don't regret having watched it. I can't imagine ever wanting to watch it again though. That's why I recommend renting it if you can. Get your nostalgia fix and when you're done I think you'll agree that it's not nearly worth the price to own it.The first DVD in the set has a complete story arc. Rent that one and you'll have all you need to judge for yourself whether the purchase of the set is justified. I think you'll be glad you saved your money.
A1BC75NV2FH3MQ	0	0	This book is a paperback masquerading as a hardback. It is a paperback in every way except that it does have a rigid cover.I generally get a hardback edition of a book where available, so I ordered the Free Press Paperbacks "hardback" edition. If I'd looked at the name of the publisher that might have given me a clue that I should be wary, but unfortunately I did not.The book does not come with a dust jacket. The cover is printed like a paperback. The pages appear to be something close to newsprint, very flimsy and cheap. The book is physically smaller in dimension than I would expect a hardback to be. It is in every way what I would expect from a cheap paperback, except that it does indeed have a hard cover. There is nothing about the book to justify the outrageous price being asked for it. When I pay the higher price to get a hardback I expect to get a higher quality book. In no way does this edition deliver.
A1BC75NV2FH3MQ	0	1	I bought these because Geomag Pro are not sold in the US, and international shipping on them is prohibitively expensive. Compared to Geomag these are very low quality. The metal plating on some of the magnets was bubbling up, and on some it had already flaked off completely, causing black magnetic dust to accumulate. The strength of the magnets is a fraction of the strength of Geomag. I am still able to build with them, but the weaker magnets make some shapes more difficult to put together. The ends of the rods are larger in diameter, making it difficult to build some shapes that require a lot of rods to be attached to one ball. The balls are slightly larger which compensates for this problem somewhat, but not completely.For the price, I expected these to be of much higher quality. If I decide to make another purchase, I will either pay the international shipping on Geomag, or just refrain altogether. I would not get these again.
A1BC8S6R5UQLT7	0	0	I finally had to give up on this book after suffering through the first 100 pages. The book is a collection of articles supposedly linking certain tenets of Christianity to the perennial philosophy. Having read the perennial philosophy and having studied the eastern religions for several years, my expectations were high. I read the first few articles and just could not see their connections to the perennial philosophy. I also found the articles themselves to be of extremely limited usefulness on their own merits. If you are trying to find a glimmer of hope in the Christian world view, as I was, by seeking a connection to the perennial philosophy, particularly as it relates to the eastern practices, look elsewhere.
A1BC8S6R5UQLT7	1	1	I have enjoyed all of Bishop John Shelby Spong's books. This latest addition weaves together Bishop Spong's interpretation of how the gospel stories came about and how they should be viewed by the contemporary Christian. He makes a compelling argument that much of what appears in the gospels represents a reformulation of pre-existing Jewish folklore as expressed in the Old Testament in an attempt to understand the significance of the historical Jesus. I especially enjoyed his chapter that discusses how the Christian church will ultimately fail if it continues to struggle to hang on to old and outdated interpretations that even the faithful no longer take seriously.I had hoped that Bishop Spong would further develop what it was about the Jesus of history that made the writers feel compelled to wrap Jesus's story in such complex mythology. The latter parts of the book I felt were weak in this regard. His premise is that a man like Jesus who transcended the boundaries of prejudice, stereotype, and other human frailties was deemed to be a reflection of God and consequently became wrapped into the mythology of the Jewish Old Testament. To my mind, there must have been more than that. There have been other great men of history (Gandhi comes to mind) that did not produce the impact that Jesus Christ did. I could not help feeling that there must have been something more to the Christ story...much more to make the evangelists go through the trouble that they did to produce the gospel stories of this great man.Despite this shortcoming, I found the book to be well-written, informative, and very interesting. I highly recommend it for Progressive Christians. Orthodox Christians will not like this book and I look forward to their reviews that will undoubtably follow.
A1BC8S6R5UQLT7	1	1	I don't remember the last time that I was as affected by a book as this one. There are stories and descriptions in this book that just won't leave me. The one that I remember most is the one where the authors describe how, for that brief instant, an animal no longer wanted by its owner being left at a shelter comes to the sad recognition that its guardian will never be coming back. I am also sickened and disheartened by the reasons that some owners give for leaving their pets in shelters. This is a very difficult book to read for people that love animals and their pets. The authors have done a terrific job describing the inner world of the animal shelter and I highly recommend this book to all.
A1BC8S6R5UQLT7	1	0	Peter Singer has written one of the most articulate and well thought out cases for animal liberation that I have found in the many books that I have read on this topic. He argues that most people would give no thought to keeping a fully-aware animal in terrible conditions on a factory farm only to be killed well before it lives out a small fraction of its normal life span, but we would never consider killing a profoundly retarded infant that is completely unaware of its surroundings as a source of food. Singer also argues that it would make much more sense to conduct research designed to benefit humans on profoundly retarded human subjects that are unaware of their surroundings and that have no hope for any kind of meaningful future rather than on fully cognizant animals that are capable of living out and enjoying a normal life span. Moreover, the results produced by animal research is often poorly transferable to humans so why not use profoundly retarded humans for the studies in the first place. This is tough stuff but the arguments are compelling and any disagreement with his propositions would have to be considered speciesism. If you are an animal rights advocate, please consider reading this book. You will read material that you won't find anywhere else.
A1BCE0CQG1R0ZZ	1	1	Positively 4th Street was a thoroughly entertaining glimpse at the early '60's Folk scene, focusing on the four characters in the subtitle. This book is not restricted to Baez, Dylan, and the Farinas though. it includes many other individuals who were either in that circle or knew of it.Hajdu has done his research well. My only complaint is that the dialogue shifts and it takes a moment or two to refocus on what is going on. I particularly enjoyed learning about the other folk people, and that has encouraged me to delve into the works of other musicians; some good, some not so good. I am enjoying a collection of the Farinas work, and have started to read Farinas book, &quot;Been Down so Long, Looks Like up to Me&quot;. I learned things about Dylan and Baez that I never knew before, despite being a fan of both and following their careers from the early days on. Hajdu has written a book that makes you want to learn more. Anything that encourages more reading is certainly a good thing!I highly recommend this book.
A1BCE0CQG1R0ZZ	0	0	A Joyful Noise starts out with a track of the same name and quickly reinforces the choice of purchasing this disc. The problem is, it quickly dissolves into a cacophonous mess. There is not much in the way of &quot;Joy&quot; where this noise is concerned.I was completely disappointed. I expected so much more having heard the title track on a &quot;loss leader&quot; disc last year. Save your money.
A1BCE0CQG1R0ZZ	0	0	Daughtry. What an amazing disappointment. This is pure trash. Just goes to show you that no talent will get you somewhere. I had to give it a star. It should give me back 2 stars.
A1BCE0CQG1R0ZZ	1	1	What an unexpected surprise. This CD has the best telecaster playing that I have heard. You will not be disappointed. Amazing stuff. You will play it over and over.
A1BCEVOHW6T8CX	1	1	The author goes through the examples of the towel and basin, etc. to show that our LORD was humble and obedient, and that is the way that we are to follow him.This has been refreshing to my soul to see the beauty of the way God works when we trust in him.It reminds me not to seek my own power, but his power through service, and that he takes care of those who serve him.Good simple explanations of Bible passages, and he even puts in the balancing passages for each point.
A1BCEVOHW6T8CX	1	1	This is a simple book with a simple cover. The virtue of humility is simple, but the pervasiveness of evil pride is complex. This is a great book to read, if you want to have evil-pride exposed in your life. The diagnostic list in the back "You probably have evil-pride if you..." is a convicting tool.Covers the whole Bible's commentatry on pride. It explains the difference between good pride and evil pride.
A1BCEVOHW6T8CX	1	1	I fell in love with "St Brendan's Fair Isle" for it's rolicking great tale that had the whole audience singling the chorus. "Miss Fogerty's Christmas Cake" is great Celtic humor. Their sense of history in their music is wonderful.
A1BCG69WV9UTW5	0	1	Too stiff, way too stiff. I prefer a much more flexible spatula so that it will bend and reach the crevices in a jar, etc. Pretty to look at, although a very dark red, but minimally useful for me.
A1BCG69WV9UTW5	1	1	Great colors, neatly packaged, perfect for using on water bottles. I gave out water bottles with 3 rubber bands on eacg. Slip one off after drinking one bottle, then refill. Slip off the next band when the bottle's empty again. And so on. Easy way to keep track of water we should be drinking every day.
A1BCG69WV9UTW5	1	1	Works great for the lawn mower and for the leaf blower. The price was good and the quality is too.
A1BCG69WV9UTW5	1	1	Now how have I existed without this nifty device? My gosh, it's so much easier to shift things around with this lifter.
A1BCPU28HHVFKT	0	1	As hard as I try to get into this CD, somehow it's just not happening for me. With the exception of a few songs (Vertigo, Crumbs on Your Table, and Miracle Drug), this sounds like some outtakes from All That You Can Left Behind.I have almost all U2 CD's and really enjoy the 80's and 90's material. But this CD just falls short.Starters to U2 would be better off getting Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, or War.
A1BCSBYT5ER9QN	1	1	OK. You know Fado, n'est pas?1) Yes, and I'm a Fado fan2) NoIf (1) feel free to buy this one, it is a good overview of Fado and more. Madredeus is not here, as well as some other excellent Fado performers but it is still a terrific CD. Also from the same series, I wholeheartedly recommend Guide to Italy, Cuban Son, West Africa, South Africa, Ireland, Scotland, etc...If (2), welcome. If you like authentic and honest music, feel free to enter beautiful new world of passion and sadness and longing (in a word, Fado). This is probably the best introductory CD you can buy. Of course, there are many more gems to be discovered, but this disc will give you a pretty good idea about what to expect from music of Portugal. The knowledge of Portuguese is not required, the language of music is universal.
A1BCSBYT5ER9QN	1	1	OK. If you are into it, this is realy authentic folk playing and singing. Recorded in 1954 (excelently restored!), gives an overview of many Italian regions, not excluding minorities (Albanians of Calabria and Slavs of Venezia-Giulia), with the traditional music performed by local artists.Most impressive moment: A capella Calabrian song recorded on a fishing ship, while the crew (20 half-naked, (so the notes say!),fishermen) is raising an undersea net. It is a bawdy song, but strangely beautiful. You can hear squeaking and squeeling of the capstain throughout the song.Full notes, all texts and translations, and history. Bravo!No cheap commercial stuff, my friends, but real life material...
A1BCSBYT5ER9QN	1	1	OK. We all know what Italian music is like, don't we?Well, I thought I knew before I bought this gem. But music I heard open my eyes (or should I say ears?) to the variety of styles and genres Italy has to offer. Not to bore you: If this CD had only one track (no. 8. Jone - unfortunately you can not hear a sample) it would be worth its price. The brass band plays something that sounds like funeral melody, and it is so filled with emotions and sadness that it brings tears to your eyes. If you too live for those rare moments of beauty and elevation, this CD will definitely give you one.I guarantee it!
A1BD0YGUOMDKHF	0	1	This is a review of the actual product quality and not the movie itself. Basically, it seems like they did a shoddy job of encoding it for DVD. One wonders if it was purposefully done to encourage people to buy Blu-Ray discs. On my HD TV, the video quality is pretty pixelated and shadow areas have too much noise in them. I have other DVDs that look much, MUCH better on my TV because the information on the actual DVD's is of much higher quality. If you wondered why the price is this cheap, you now know. That said, the actual movie is wonderful and a joy to watch!
A1BD560IODGX4S	0	0	I listened to tis book on audio, all hundred chapters of it. It started well, full of verve, biting satire, and originality. But after about half way it began to tail off. It became humdrum, repetitive, lacking in originality. by the end I was thinking, I suppose I'd better keep goint to the end to find out who marries who - not that I really care too much any more.Like many books at that time, The Way We Live Now was published in episodes - sort of like a modern soap opera. This explains the enormous numbers of chapters. Presumably by the time the first chapters were being published the writer hadn't written the end of the book - probably hadn't even decided what the ending was going to be. And it shows. Towwards the end I had the impression that even the writer himself was getting bored, just wanting to get through it and finish the contracted number of episodes before thankfully laying down his pen.Overall a disappointing end to a promising beginning. Barchester Towers is far better, in my opinion!
A1BDQHMRVG2UXJ	1	1	This is by far the Best adaption on film of Treasure Island, I do not know why this is not on DVD! They need to get this on DVD SOON LIKE NOW!!!FAMILY FAVOROTE!!The Chieftains wow AWSOME SOUNDTRACK!
A1BDQHMRVG2UXJ	1	1	I grew up with this film, please release this on DVD, THis is one of the greatest films ever made why is it not on DVD!!!RELEASE IT PLEASE!!!!!
A1BDQHMRVG2UXJ	1	1	This is very well done there are some great reviews on here but I do have one complaint and there is something Historically In-accurant and that is Elizabeth was a Protestant and did not seek Oricals and seek the stars for direction, she prayed to God, other than that the movie was very well done.Enjoy the first one and this second one WONDEFUL!!
A1BDQHMRVG2UXJ	1	1	This is such a wonderful tv series I dont understand why they dont have the rest of the seasons out on DVD. So BRING THEN OUT ON DVD!!!Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth are wondeful!
A1BDSA5LEGBLDV	1	1	"Spiral bound Hanon"Those three words were music to my ears (pun intended), and my next thought was "Where have you been all my life?" I am so glad I ordered this book. I've always enjoyed Hanon - I dig it our every year or so for a while but, having lost my old stiffly bound copy, I decided to try this, and it's just great.
A1BDSA5LEGBLDV	0	0	This is one of our favorite films, so were were naturally excited to be able to order it on Blu-Ray - particularly with the boast that the cinematographer supervised the transfer. Sadly, it's an absolutely atrocious transfer. We thought we'd just gotten a defective disc, and had Amazon send us another. But, the problems were the same with both discs. Basically, every scene that isn't in bright sunlight (and there are many) is nearly unwatchable. It's filled with the most distracting ghosting and video noise. Absolutely appalling. Furthermore, and equally maddening, the sound isn't quite synced correctly. It's not off enough to seem completely wrong, just enough to drive you slightly mad. I'm really shocked. I've never had this happen with a Blu-Ray, and never had to write a review like this. Do not buy this item!
A1BDSJYWFH2OIW	1	1	A great potboiler of a novel! As a southerner, I appreciated the authentic feel of Tartt's description of the 1970s post-desegregation cultural transition. Tartt also does a great job depicting southern cultural eccentricities, particularly the role of the rigid, domineering southern matriarch who serves as the glue for an otherwise dysfunctional family, and the clanish tendency of families to project identities of "piety and decency" that cover-up the less than noble truths which exist behind closed doors. As I read this novel, I kept thinking of my mother's eccentric family and my great-aunt who was a mirror-image of Harriet's grandmother. Fascinating character studies.
A1BE3A4RRD8KU	1	1	I was looking for a surge protector that protected ALL of the following: My TV, DIRECTV box, PlayStation 3, Xbox, and home theater sound system. This surge protector does exactly that and has plently of joules to do so. The only reason I rated it 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5, is the surge protector feels kinda cheap. It works, but I've only had it for one day. I will change my rating to 5 out of 5 stars if it is still working in a year.

A1BE3A4RRD8KU	0	0	I assumed this Wahl trimmer would be great because I had a Wahl trimmer for a few years that was excellent. I was wrong, dead wrong, this product does not work, simply put, it's crap.
A1BE3A4RRD8KU	1	1	Origianlly, I had a Shark vacuum that I used for cleaning my car. I purchased a new car, Mercedes-Benz C300, and figured it was time to get a new vacuum to clean out my car. I was going to get another Shark vacuum, which is decent by the way, but decided on the Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum 71B. Let me say, it is amazing. This vacuum has a ton of power and suction and cleans the interior of my car like no other. I would highly recommend this product.
A1BEI3H95JJDGA	1	1	While it's not exactly "quiet," it's not annoying - it's about as loud as your average shop vac (although I'd recommend wearing earplugs with any vacuum if you're in an enclosed space like a small room or hallway). I'm very impressed with the overall quality of construction - the hose is a heavy commercial type, the body of the unit is heavy polymer with exremely well-fitted seams. It produces a very strong vacuum - so don't be fooled by the 1.5 HP rating (as compared to the "6 HP" shop vacs that you see in building supply stores). It has dual internal filters - one main "bag" and one filter for the motor. You will need to buy a sanding head separately - and be sure to get an adapter for the hose on the sanding head to adapt to the 2.25" vacuum hose. In use, I can attest to the fact that it is very close to completely dustless. As a matter of fact, if you're used to having dust falling out from under your sanding device, it can feel like you're not removing any material - and then *wham* - you're into the paper . My unit showed up with shipping damage(UPS' fault), but the broken part was cheerfully replaced free of charge by the Love-Less folks - so I can also vouch for the customer service of the company (and it's a US company - which is nice).
A1BEI3H95JJDGA	1	1	If you own a miter-saw -and use it fairly regularly - and don't exactly like to get down on your knees and use it on the floor while balancing long stock on pieces of 2X4 (i.e. you value your back, your knees, and your sanity) - then this stand is for you. The saw-mounting system is solid, quick to use, and indexes well (locks in place on the stand at the same point every time). It puts the saw at a good working-height, and the outrigger arms are solid and don't require an inordinate amount of fiddling to get them locked in place. The legs deploy and stow with a simple, solid mechanism. I rated this a 4-star product because of the outrigger supports/stops; while they work, they are a bit of a pain to get set correctly. If you want to use the flip-up saw stops for any repetitive precision cuts, it takes a while to get them set *just* right (they tend to "walk" as you tighten the thumbscrews). Now that I mention that, it would be nice if the locking mechanism for the supports was designed differently - it's very clumsy to reach inside them to operate the small thumbscrews if you have large hands. Regardless of all the nit-picks, though, I still think this was a good purchase for me, and would buy this stand again.
A1BEI3H95JJDGA	1	1	I'm a professional animator and a huge 3D tech-buff - and this movie fed both addictions ;) If you liked the first Appleseed, you'll love Ex Machina - the animation is better (still mocap - but better action), the characters are redesigned and look a little less stylized (but manage to avoid the "uncanny valley" effect. Set design, rendering, and effects overall are improved. The story, while not what I would call "amazing", is good, and is a little less "Japanese" in that there is a more clearly defined "good" and "evil" - so it's more palatable for those not familiar with hard-core Anime (i.e. most American viewers). Overall, this video is a visual feast filled with over-the-top action - a "must see" for Anime, Sci-Fi, and Action fans.
A1BEI3H95JJDGA	0	0	It's my fault for not paying closer attention, but realize that the image shown is of an *8oz* canister, NOT a 4oz canister (which is what they're selling/shipping) - I consider this borderline false advertising - so buyer beware.Performance-wise it seems to work OK. I have an MSR Reactor stove and the few quick tests I did the canister snugged up fine,didn't leak, and burned as expected.Final Thoughts: If I'd have realized these were 4oz canisters, I wouldn't have bought them - I jumped on the deal because I thought they were 8oz (as in the picture) - so just keep that in mind when you're looking.
A1BF2NBMREAQCK	0	1	This is a beautiful book but not a lot of help if you're learning. It's more for an accomplished artist who would like to fine tune their craft. If I had seen the book before I bought it, I definetly would have saved my money.
A1BF2NBMREAQCK	1	1	As always John MacArthur is great when it comes to Scripture. He never fails to amaze me. His books are like his radio program, thorough in every respect and there's never a question about the material because he always includes all the Scripture passages where everything is found. If I could only listen to one pastor or read one pastors books it would have to be MacArthur.
A1BF2NBMREAQCK	1	1	Method products are great. I always use this cleaner for the kitchen and bathroom. It has a real nice smell and does the job. It's great for cutting grease. I'm allergic to so many products and have lung problems too, so most of the cleaners on the market are always questionable. Some have caused pneumonia so from now on I will be sticking with Method.Their products are always safe to use.
A1BF2NBMREAQCK	1	1	I was really pleased with this book. It was in excellent condition and arrived on time. It's great doing business with booksellers like this. Thank You!!!!!!!!!
A1BFCGCSIA7308	1	1	I've been a fan of Dan Lorenzo's guitaring back to his work with Hades and Non-Fiction. I feel Dan sort of inspired much of the downtuning sound that became so popular. I wasn't sure what direction to expect with his solo stuff, but once I heard the powerful riff in "1974", I was hooked. "1974" is probably my favorite cut on the disc. It is an aggressive song with great vocals that just draws you in. "Bocca Della Verita" is a unique instrumental and "You're Out" probably has one of Dan's best riffs ever. Some of the biggest metal bands out there should hire Dan to write riffs for them.
A1BFCGCSIA7308	1	1	Although I heard mixed reviews, I found this to be a great shake maker. Highly recommended!
A1BFCGCSIA7308	1	1	I absolutely love this movie. I've been an Anvil fan since 1982 and was a member of their fan club in 1983. Seeing that the band still have the same passion as well as the desire to make it to the big time is inspiring. I could write a hundred great things about what I love about this movie, but the thing I think the movie fails to do is really dive into the reason they initially lost their momentum early on. The movie should have mentioned that in 1984, their 4th album was a compilation that featured a few new songs, which was hardly a good move for them. Then, they had a three year absence before coming out with "Strength of Steel" in 1987. Three years out of the public eye was disastrous for them. By the time they released the outstanding "Pound for Pound" in 1988, most metal fans moved on to something else and Anvil drifted into obscurity. Most will say the point of the movie isn't about that and I agree, but a movie called "The Story of Anvil" shouldn't leave out vital information like that because anyone can tell that these factors probably played into it. I see they have a book out too, so I'll have to read this to see if they touch on this subject there. I still give the DVD five stars because it's an incredible movie and is extremely brave in the approach. It deserves a 6th star for Lars Ulrich's incredible interview in the DVD extras. As much as I've complained about him in the past, I can't say a bad thing about him anymore!
A1BFDR2UG4NAJW	1	1	Fun and whimsical play by Neil Simon is not as good as his previous plays but has the charm in spades by three great performances by Mercedes Ruehi, who is a gem in her role, Richard Dreyfuss is a great hoot as well and Irene Worth is magnificent as the grandmother. If you are looking for a great movie with a lot of charm, this is it.
A1BFJ9OJVGLTLB	0	0	It just seems like it is. The author supports thoughtless reproduction to create cannon fodder for the "End Times," and never using the faculty of reason that God gave us. These Talibangelicals oppress their women, beat their children, and blame it all on God.This isn't Christian. It's just crazy. Somebody needs to bone up on their Beatitudes.
A1BFJ9OJVGLTLB	0	0	James Dobson, who wrote about proudly beating his own dog with a leather belt, gives sadistic, un-Christian advice to parents looking for help. Skip this book, practice the Golden Rule. If you think Jesus would approve of whipping little children, you need to repeat Sunday School.
A1BFJ9OJVGLTLB	0	1	James Dobson, himself an admitted victim of child abuse, tries to carry on that sadistic, very un-Christian tradition here. Don't bother reading this book -- memorize the Sermon on the Mount instead. Practice the Golden Rule.
A1BFJ9OJVGLTLB	1	1	This brush whitened my teeth faster than any product I've ever used, including years of whitening trays.I've had no problem charging this toothbrush at all.I'm having some problems finding replacement heads -- my dentist doesn't have any, I got some through Amazon, but now they're way too expensive.Other than that, it's great.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	1	1	i am a great fan of most of fela's work with africa/nigeria 70, prefering their tongue-in-cheek approach and james brown inspired hooks to fela's more radical and often more political (read:boring) work with Egypt 80. that said, this bootleg release, recorded i believe sometime in the early 80's in France(? - check that, i'm not positive about this. i don't have my copy on me currently) is by far his best, topping even &quot;water no got enemy,&quot; &quot;gentleman,&quot; and the crowd pleasing &quot;lady.&quot; this version of odoo, far different from the edited and tame sounding version found on the &quot;best best,&quot; is a bit of a medley, incorporating elements from &quot;zombie,&quot; &quot;confusion,&quot; and &quot;unknown soldier&quot; if memory serves me well. the transitions are far smoother than anything i've heard him try anywhere else. overall, this is a classic release. &quot;confusion break bone&quot; is also featured in an amazing light here, dwarfing that found on the &quot;best best.&quot; the song loops and twists, sometimes spinning onto the sinister. don't be fooled by the fact that only two tracks are included on this album. the cd is about 55 mins. long, giving an insightful and flavorful joyride through the hemp-induced opium dream lived by fela at the peak of his career. i only wish that my brother hadn't scratched my copy of it. a definite must for both long time fans and fela-neophytes.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	1	1	With &quot;Thinking . . . ,&quot; Clark has produced one of the most important history books of the 20th century. Clark voices ground breaking views of a vastly misunderstood phenomenon - the evolution and prosecution of witchcraft in the early modern period. This book is meticulously researched and well written.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	0	1	Disclaimer: the author of this review is a serious Burzum fan.Moynihan comes off as a man with a mission in this one . . . the mission being to prove that the entire second wave of black metal, of which the so-called Norse Black Metal Mafia was an integral part, was an expression of the rebirth of the spirit of National Socialism and Paganism within Scandanavia and people of Germanic/Scandanavian descent. While this may have been the view of a very few select members of &quot;the movement,&quot; particularly Varg Vikernes; it certainly wasn't the outlook of others who helped create the medium. The book focuses mainly upon Moynihan's misrepresentations of Varg's anti-Semitic Neo-Pagan philosophies and Moynihan's own biases and views, and completely omits large parts of the entire history in order to make the Black Metal Movement seem like it was a well formed crusade in the name of Quisling influenced Facism and Paganism. The history and role of many key bands, most glaringly Darkthrone and Thorns, are completely omitted, while more interesting and obcure stories such as the death threats levelled against the band Fleurety are completely ignored. Moynihan also turns a blind eye to important non-Scandanavian bands such as Tormentor and Sigh.&quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; is well written for all of its faults, and is important in that it attempts to chronicle the history and philosophies evolved by an astounding group of musicians. It contains a great deal of photos and does contain a few good interviews - the most exciting of which are probably those with Garm of Ulver. One may wish to take these interviews with a grain of salt, considering to what degree Varg's comments were apparently distorted. The book gets a second star simply for the photos and the fact that Moynihan even bothered to tackle a difficult topic, despite his cheesy paparazzo approach to the subject.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	1	1	Ahhh, Nocturnal Obeisance . . . classic Quorthon before all the operatic powermetal stuff (What the hell was that &quot;One Rode to Asa Bay&quot; video about?). This album was a great influence upon Mayhem, Burzum and Dark Throne. &quot;Woman of Dark Desires&quot; is still one of the greatest metal tracks ever laid down.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	1	1	I'm really lazy today, and don't feel like writing much, except to say that Min Tid Skal Komme is a truly innovative and original release, combining as it does the dark hypnotic nihilism of Burzum with the spacey abstraction of Pink Floyd. Most tracks contain at least some female vocals; not, however, your typically weak 3rd and the Mortal type whinging female stuff. The female vocals on this one pour out rich and full, in stark contrast to Svein's icy growl. I would rank this album with the 10 greatest black metal releases of the early 90s, particularly since they've tacked the Darker Shade of Evil and Absence tracks on this reissue. I don't have the re-issue, so I don't know whether they've cleaned up the "Darker" material, but if they haven't, the necro quality of the recording will probably be unappealing to more mainstream listeners. This is an album best digested with liberal amounts of acid or opium.
A1BFJUHPP9JS0O	0	0	i received this product as a recommendation from a friend. it is terrible - the cases won't snap onto the headphones, and so are useless. avoid at all costs.
A1BFO0O2FT0O3T	0	0	I had seen the first Butterfly Effect years ago when it first came out. I absolutely loved it, and it rose to be one of my top favorite movies. Some time later, I saw that they released this sequel. It was clearly a B-movie that slipped under the radar and had no promotions whatsoever. I wasn't convinced, and I avoided it like the plague.Just a few days ago, I found a combo pack of the two movies at the store for very cheap. I'd never owned the first one unfortunately and I couldn't beat the cheap price. Plus, I figured I'd just take a look at the sequel and maybe give it a chance. The cheap cost made buying it worth it just for the first one alone.Now, I didn't think that the Butterfly Effect 2 was the worst sequel ever made, but it wasn't good by any means. The plot feels like a remix of the first, using some of the same elements in what gets "messed up" when he goes back to try and fix things.None of the original actors return, so don't hold your breath for that.There is absolutely no suspense either. There is no "climax" in the story, nothing. It seems to go at about the same pace for the entire movie. I think it may be because of this that there's no surprises either. Everything seemed very obvious to me, and I was able to guess just about every "turning point" that the movie had.There was no emotional impact unlike the original, and you could not feel any emotion for either main character regardless of what happened to them. Everything that the characters do and say feels very forced, not like they are actually feeling said emotions.Despite its flaws, I sat through it until the end without thinking "I need to just shut this off" so I suppose did enjoy it to some degree. I'm not sure just how much (I doubt it was much), but it at least wasn't bad enough for me to turn it off.If you're skeptical, walk away, and you'll be just fine never seeing it. If you're just dying to see it, maybe a rent wouldn't hurt.
A1BFO0O2FT0O3T	1	1	This is the sort of thing that, if you're not a fan of A7X to the core, there will be absolutely nothing here to interest you. But if are such a fan, this is a definite "must."The video spans from when they started to form as friends all the way back in middle school, to how they got started as a band, and every single change along the way. There's plenty of "inside" footage as well, showing the guys when they're not recording. Sure, some of it's a little over the top and maybe a little too shameless, but it's them. It's the band acting more as friends than just a band, and it's hilarious to be able to see that side. It's not very often that a band is actually willing to show that kind of thing to its fans, I guess.The only part that was a little unfortunate was how short the DVD actually seems to be. I've heard that there are "extras" you can find if you click around during the actual DVD, but I haven't done that yet, since it's kind of an inconvenience.Overall, it's a great DVD that really every fan of the band should see, both for the laughs and to know their whole "story."
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	0	In this "Limited Edition" set, there are two movies hosted by Joel and two from Mike Nelson, so if you're strictly a Joel or Mike fan, check this out.#105 - "The Corpse Vanishes." Joel Hodgson hosts this cheap and cheesy movie with Bela Lugosi. After making "Dracula," lugosi sadly declined into silly movies like this one. Before BOTOX, you had to kill young Brides to make a youth serum for vain women, like Lugosi's wife (why are only young Women always killed??) Joel and the Bots do a decent job of riffing this silly movie about a mad scientist, youthful wife and killer orchids.#501 - "Warrior of the Lost World" - Joel hosts this movie about a dusty hero with a talking motorcycle and evil dictator. There are more explosions than you can count, with some even in slow-motion. Dummies, are thrown off buildings in an attempt to make them look like the bad humans. Stars Robert Ginty and Donald Pleasance.#521 - "Santa Claus" - Mike Nelson and the Bots keep it alive with this dreadful movie made in Mexico in 1959. The beginning is a bunch of kids singing the longest song ever recorded in any movie...ever made. Add in the devil, Merlin the magician and Santa being in Space instead of the North Pole. The dubbing into English is also laughable.#701 - "Night of the Blood Beast" - Mike Nelson and the Bots host this Roger Corman movie that stars Ed Nelson. The short is "Once Upon a Honeymoon." The guys always loved to riff Corman and shorts from the 50's. They do a good job on both. Don't pay too much attention to the plot about an Astronaut who is a breeder for aliens. This is NOT the one with Sigourney Weaver. That's what makes it Hilarious.The icing on the cake is that you get your own little Tom Servo in this Limited Edition set. I must have him to keep my Crow T Robot company!Mystery Science Theater 3000: 20th Anniversary Edition [Limited Edition]
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	Although we can see this movie just about any Halloween season, I decided to buy it for our collection. This movie was groundbreaking in its time. It's odd that we know everything that's going to happen but it still gives me the shivers. Everything came together in "Psycho." An original script; terrific acting; music that is as essential to the fright scenes as the script; and an ending that you never see coming. Of course if you've seen the movie once, you know how it ends. But in the 50's none of this was ever done, especially by actors of Janet Leigh's status.After all these years, I still find it chilling.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	This set has the best horror work done by Lon Chaney; the original "Wolf Man" and the follow-up movie, "Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein." I know the first movie by heart and see it often on TCM during Halloween. The second movie isn't shown as often and is one of my all-time favorites.In the "Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein," they give us a chilling atmospheric opening. Two grave robbers break into the tomb of Lawrence Talbot, who died in the first movie. I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it but the grave robbers learn the error of their ways. Lawrence Talbot aka The Wolf Man is free again.I hadn't seen "Werewolf of London," or "She-Wolf of London," in years. But the addition of these two movies doesn't distract one bit from the set. In "She Wolf," Lockwood is terrific as the frightened woman who thinks she's a werewolf. She may be, but I'm not saying!In today's world of horror, this is tame enough for family viewing. If you have very young and easily-frightened children, maybe not. It would probably earn a PG rating.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	The DVD cover is very misleading, because this is actually a fictionalized version of the real Count Vlad Dracul's life. His history was the basis for Bram Stoker's blood-sucking vampire, Dracula. The movie is well made and I think I originally saw it on the History Channel during Halloween.Rudolf Martin is very good and quite attractive as Vlad. The movie begins where he is recounting his life. A younger actor portrays him as a teen when he and his brother are emprisoned by the Sultan. When he is older and goes back to Romania, he fights to free his people from tyranny. To do this he becomes a tyrant himself. There are a few gruesome scenes that I think would be inappropriate for young children (he was called "Vlad the Impaler" for a reason).I've seen quite a few documentaries about the real Count Dracul and this is not actual fact as stated in the description. It's some fact and mostly fiction. The writers added some humor and some hints to where the vampire Dracula's and Count Dracul's lives seem to merge. At one point, when he is being questioned by the priests, they mention that he dipped his bread in his victim's blood and ate it. He wearily says, "I've heard these stories so often, I'm beginning to believe them myself."The real Count Dracul would be amused!
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	0	1	Our family loves fruitcake and it's our Christmas tradition. We like to vary who we buy from because they're all very good, just different on the fruit to nuts ratio. This year we bought Grandma's from Figis (we found it on Figis internet site). I made sure it was the same cake as sold on Amazon before I wrote this review.The main problem is that we got more cake than fruit and nuts. It was also somewhat dry, probably because of the lack of moist fruit. The cake tastes quite good, but definitely not worth $30 for a good-tasting cake with a little bit of fruit and nuts. Seeing all the other glowing reviews, we probably got a batch that wasn't thrown out by quality assurance. What a disappointment! The photos look great, but they don't match what we received.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	Two movies are hosted by Joel and two by Mike. Another noticable change is in "The Crawling Eye," where a different cast member is the voice for TOM SERVO. Here's the info on each episode:"The Crawling Eye" - Joel Hodgson and the Bots host this 1958 Black & White SciFi movie starring Forest Tucker. This was in the early days of MST3K and Josh Weinstein does the voice for Tom Servo. If you haven't seen the early shows you will definitely notice the difference between Weinstein's deadpan Tom and the wonderful Kevin Murphy who does an emotive and emotional Tom Servo. The movie, set in a mountain resort, is somewhat scarey at times, especially when the fog comes in and nasty things happen to the humans. The ending reveals the real monster and there's even more laughs at how lame it looks."The Beatniks" - Joel Hodgson and the Bots host this 1960 movie that stars Peter Breck (from The Big Valley). Oddly enough, it doesn't have one single Beatnik but it does have hoods. One wants to break out of his criminal past because he can sing. He gets an offer that can bring fame and fortune. Stupidity prevails. The short is another segment of "General Hospital." Really boring old soap opera about depressed, boring medical people who you would never want to stick needles in your arm!"The Final Sacrifice" - This one is a MUST SEE!! A favorite among most fans, Mike Nelson and the Bots host this really cheesy movie from Canada. This is the first MST3K movie in the set where Bill Corbett takes over to be the personna of Crow T Robot. A pasty, skinny, nerdy kid who lives with his aunt somehow comes across a priceless map that leads to a lost city. Immediately, a Cult of guys are after him for the map. Apparently all you need to be part of the Cult is a pickup truck, ski mask and black clothing from Walmart. A guy named Zap Rowsdower, who formerly belonged to the Pickup Truck Cult protects the kid. Although MST3K went off the air a few years ago, this one sticks out in my mind, for the homage to CANADA. (I'm Joking). Mike and Crow are singing a somewhat disparaging tune about Canadians. Tom breaks in (dressed like a Mountie) and berates them. He soon has a song of his own but goes waaaaay overboard. He winds up apologizing to the entire population of Canada! The Riffing is hilarious too."The Blood Waters of Dr Z" - Mike and the Bots host this awful 1975 movie that would make Ed Wood look like Steven Spielberg. A mad doctor transforms himself into a swamp creature and decides he needs mates. Enter pretty women. The beginning is a lot of voice-over and narration which almost takes up one third of the movie. Really, really cheesy creature costumes and very cheap filming make great fodder for the Crew.In previous sets, Shout Factory added the funniest animation at the beginning of each episode, where the Bots re-create scenes from the movie. The bonus Mini-Posters were shots from the animation. Shout has added more posters with this set.

A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	SPOILER ALERT! (this review contains some info that may be spoilers)Christopher Lloyd is hilarious as the older relative of a young boy. They recently moved to a new town where people are absolutely terrified of Halloween. Anyone who dares to put up Halloween decorations soon finds them gone. The movie goes into the town's history and why the people do not celebrate or have any fun during Halloween. But as the movie goes along we realize that people have been misled, and after some scarey scenes, the issue is resolved. The DVD cover shows Lloyd as a ghoul, also for a good reason. But he's a funny, lovable ghoul.Why is it not for very young kids? Well, unless they've been watching movies about Ghouls, people rising from the dead, and a teen being killed is a gruesome way, it may be a bit too intense for them. This is done in a funny vein but the scenes are also scarey.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	0	0	I turned blue in the face trying to punch out one flower! Lining it up on a small area is difficult too (I cut a few bookmarks with my Cricut and wanted to try a simple flower on top of each). I even tried to use it on flimsy paper, but failed. I never used punches before, but this will be my first and last one from this company. If I can, I'll return it to Michael's for a refund. I should have taken a hint from the many previously opened and taped up Punches they had hanging on the wall.If I had a 250-pound tackle from the NFL to press this thing for me, then I'd have it made! However, my measly efforts resulted in only frustration and a sore hand.I admire the one reviewer who said he was able to use it!
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	0	I ordered these "Quality Park" clasp envelopes from Office Depot. I couldn't find this size in any store so I decided to order online, and the store had them sent from the warehouse.I paid $26.19 for a box of 100 envelopes, which came to 26 cents each. However, I received only 92. I needed all of them to work on a crafting project. I got on the company's website and sent an email but I received no reply. I called the company six days later and got a recorded message. Someone did call me back. I mentioned the problem and asked that they send the missing envelopes. To my amazement, I received 10 in the mail....a day later!!Please be sure to count the number of items you get in an unsealed box, even something that seems as insignificant as envelopes. At this price it can amount to a big loss to consumers (especially if you tend to order often).
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	0	0	I bought this exact same DVD, with the same cover, in the Store. Right out of the box, I tried to watch "The Strangler," with Victor Buono. I did say "tried." There was NO sound. A bit of low keyed something which I guess was supposed to be the soundtrack. But it didn't transfer onto this DVD. It's a shame because I saw this movie before and enjoyed it.I took it back to the store for a refund.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	SPOILERS ALERT! (I'm adding some light Spoilers in my review....but not the ending)I have to confess that this movie absorbed me. I truly hated it the first timeI viewed it on cable (free, on-demand). I couldn't figure it out at all; there wereso many things going on without any real understaning of why.The movie seemed to first be a "Haunting"; then it was about people making a movieabout a mass murder: then it flipped to people showing up in the actual hoteland being haunted (they didn't drive there they simply showed up); people diedwithout us actually seeing a killer; The present and past victims morphed into eachother. oh yeah, there was an evil doll.After watching that, I was determined to watch again to figure it all out. Then Igot hooked. The visuals were unique to me because this is the first time I've watcheda Japanese Horror movie. The subtitles weren't a problem on the DVD.I have to say that this odd Japanese movie was fascinating to me. It was also annoyingand distressing (we see two children being murdered).The twist toward the end came as a complete surprise to me, especially since I was alreadyconfused. We see the murderer in reflection, and the present murderer is revealed.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	Crabtree and Evelyn have shown that they extend quality and taste beyond their fragrances and soaps.This is more than a cookbook, it's a fully illustrated book with lovely photos and beautiful drawings ofexotic locations, fruit, vegetables, and even exotic food labels. The recipes are set up nicely and easy to read. I didn't see any fine print that you would have to strain to read. There's some English recipes included in the "Christmas Feast." Included are "Roast Goose" and "Christmas Pudding with nutmeg hard sauce." Okay, I won't do the goose, yet.I have made the "Trout with Tartare Stuffing" and "Buttery Onion Biscuits." Easy to do, and I'm not anadvanced cook.It's a beautiful book in every way. It's also a fully fuctional cookbook. So it's well worth the price.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	0	Eight movies for this amount of money makes you realize you'll not be getting all terrific classic Horror. I paid only five bucks elsewhere. However, you do get the original "Puppet Master" with Paul LeMat and creepy voiced William Hickey. I mostly wanted Wes Craven's "Dracula III:Legacy" which is decently acted by Jason Lee, Roy Schneider and Rutger Hauer. The rest are: "Halloween Resurrection," "The Prophecy II", "The Nurse", "Live Animals," "Roman," and "Paranormal Entity". (These movies have people I've never heard of, but Jamie Lee Curtis walks thru "Halloween" for a sec). If you want to know who stars in these other movies or what they're about I'm sure they're listed on the IMDB website.I'm keeping mine for the two movies mentioned.
A1BFPW6FP0DPNF	1	1	When the first Dark Shadows DVD collections came out, I bought five (sets 1-5). This collection is wonderful! There's a recap of the early "Dark Shadows" episodes when it was only a Gothic soap opera. The series was failing and headed for cancellation when Dan Curtis came up with the Vampire angle. The introduction to that was a doozy for the time! It still thrills me to see the episodes. The women looked gorgeous with designer outfits and lovely makeup & hair. The men looked great for their roles. Soap operas were not watched by us teenagers until this time. I'm sure the reviewers before me already mentioned what's in this set, but I have to say that it has all the episodes and interviews that were in the first set I bought (it's still for sale here but for a much higher price). I think you'll love seeing how Barnabas is literally set free from his chains and the wonderful chaos that follows.There are four DVD's in the box that are easy to get to and the packaging is nicely designed. I also own Dark Shadows, the Vampire Curse. It is a compilation of the episodes that showed how Barnabas became a Vampire and ends with the "present" 1967 episodes. You might want to do some comparison shopping for price.Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse
A1BFX1QHVP6VA4	1	1	Easily one of the greatest Dire Straits concerts ever. A very young Mark Knopfler, and the rest of the band. One very endearing aspect of this band is the innate chemistry between the different members - they smile at each other, and the overall environment on stage seems very relaxed, pleasant and enjoyable. They really enjoy playing together. The energy of the band is evident, but most important of all - the music! You could listen to this concert with your eyes closed, and enjoy every moment of it - probably more. These guys can play. Knopfler's Sprechgesang - not quite singing, not quite speaking, is a unique way of imbibing emotion into the most ordinary of words. His guitar of course is really adding another 'voice' to his music. These guitars are all abut "tone". This concert is no different in that regard. One of the best renditions of 'Solid Rock", and "Local Hero". That last one will have you with either a very sad, and heavy heart, and/or tears welling up in your eyes - so moving is the rendition!One of the drawbacks of the production, is that it is very simple: you get to either play a specific song, or the entire concert. We have been spoiled by other productions, which have background material, featurettes, and so on. None of that here. I also wish the concert was available in a Stereo rendition. You get a Dolby Digital version of the concert. Concerts are seen with the band performing in front of you, not all around you. The producers screwed up in that regard. Exceptional sound quality, though, and you can really hear the guitars wail. If you enjoy Knopfler, you'll love this concert.
A1BFX1QHVP6VA4	1	1	The shelf itself is very beautiful. Just a couple of things to note:- the width that is described is for the overall shelf. The usable shelf width is only 2-15/16", so the description that says the shelf width is 4" is wrong.- there was a little bit of blackening of the mirror in one corner (at-least the one I received), but this flaw is minor for my purposes, and so I'm ignoring it.All in all, a great mirror-shelf, but I wish there were more accurate and pertinent information available on important aspects, such as usable shelf width, etc...
A1BFX1QHVP6VA4	0	0	The folks who designed this software should go back to kindergarten. How on earth does anyone make a software that does not install onto a hard drive, is beyond me? Are these guys so paranoid about their intellectual property that they forgot the fundamentals of software deployment? Not everyone likes to carry around a CD with their laptop, once a software is installed. I'm sick and tired of software designers who do not trust that many people who use software actually pay for it and buy it. Josh Waitzkin should reasses his association with UBISOft. In their brilliant attempt to thwart piracy, they have created a totally useless piece of software, especially for the 21st century.
A1BFX1QHVP6VA4	1	1	Easily one of the finest Leonard Cohen compilations ever. It does have an amazing selection, which is no mean feat considering the canon of Cohen's work. The supporting musicians are incredible in their own right. I only wish they had a violinist on "Closing time" instead of the instrument of wind, played by Dino Soldo. He is a great musician, but the violin on the original (from the album, The Future) is one of the finest in a rock piece. It is almost like the violin and the rest of the music are having a conversation, and the violin always seems to be "asking a question" - I find this kind of dialog very moving. That said, Leonard Cohen is one of those musicians who seems to magically know what works. His voice is so deep that it seems to come from his socks, but there are a myriad emotions he conveys, very effectively and smoothly.All in all, one of the best music concerts ever recorded.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	0	Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo. Since, like its predecessor, it involves a long sea voyage with a sadistic captain, it can't miss, right? Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	1	Despite some good points (for example, it is definitely not boring), Francis Ford Coppola's film version of the legendary vampire tale may be the most overblown, pretentious horror film that had been made up to that time. (Whether it has been surpassed since I cannot say.) The film is a classic example of not knowing when to stop. Everything is too loud, too colorful, too sumptuous. Titling the film &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; is in itself pretentious, as it is only slightly more faithful to the novel than most other film versions. The novel certainly did not include any snickering sexual innuendo, or Dracula making an appearance as a hideous humanoid bat. As Dr. Van Helsing, the great vampire fighter, Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance so overacted that it must be seen to be believed. When we first encounter Dracula, he looks like a living mummy dragging a bridal train behind him and, when angry, he roars like a wounded rhinoceros. When he becomes younger (after feeding on youthful blood), he looks like a hippy. When Mina realizes the shocking truth about Dracula, she lightly pounds on his back with her fist. (And I do NOT think this is supposed to be funny.) In making this film, Mr. Coppola forgot an important fact -- anything that is so overblown cannot be taken seriously.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	Edward G. Robinson proves once again that he was first-rate at both drama and comedy, in this delightful film about a gangster boss who is almost rubbed out by rivals, but is nursed back to health by the monks at a nearby monastery. His fondness for orchids gives him the name of Brother Orchid and he ultimately chooses the right lifestyle, of course. But there are plenty of amusing complications along the way. The supporting cast members (Ann Sothern, Humphrey Bogart, Donald Crisp) are all excellent. Director Lloyd Bacon was undoubtedly one of the best, but least heralded, Hollywood directors of the 30s and 40s.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	0	Rondo Hatton was a victim of acromegaly whose deformed face (and voice) were tastelessly exploited in several films of the Forties. This one has two distinctions -- it was Hatton's last film (he died before its release) and it was the only Universal horror film which Universal did not bother to release, but rather sold to the ultra-low budget studio PRC for release, altho the film still begins with the Universal logo. The plot involves a handsome college student whose face becomes deformed due to a laboratory accident. Since Hatton actually was handsome and athletic in his pre-acromegaly period, the film has a bizarre parallel with his own life. (But it is difficult to accept that this type of deformity could be caused by a splash of acid.) The nouveau ugly man becomes a brutal killer, proving it is possible to be grotesque on the outside and rotten on the inside, too. He befriends a young blind woman who believes blind people have good character judgment, yet she never suspects he is a brutal killer. This grim, depressing film is interesting in a perverse way.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	This faithful adaptation of Fritz Leiber's novel &quot;Conjure Wife&quot; is one of the very best horror films of the Sixties. (An earlier film version, WEIRD WOMAN, is fun but has little to do with the novel.) The basic gimmick (a strictly rational scientist is forced to confront genuine supernatural happenings) is standard for the genre, but there are several interesting variations here. The climax is chillingly suspenseful, and the acting, direction, and photography are first-rate. The fact that the two scripters, Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson, were the authors of many fine horror/fantasy short stories, also helps.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	Robert Mitchum again proves his versatility in a chilling performance as one of the slimiest movie characters of the decade, a rapist who seeks major revenge on the witness whose testimony put him in prison for 8 years. When Gregory Peck tells him it makes him sick to even breathe the same air, you will feel the same way. And when Mitchum beats up a gang of thugs who have been extralegally hired to beat HIM up, you can actually believe he could have done it. Other elements of the film (J. Lee Thompson's suspenseful direction, Bernard Herrmann's musical score) are also excellent, but Mitchum makes it something special. The scene in which he menaces Peck's young daughter near her school (but without actually doing anything!) is particularly effective.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	If you are in the mood for a very entertaining, old-fashioned Hollywood sea adventure, this would be a good choice. Gregory Peck may not be a truly great actor, but it is hard to imagine anyone who would have been better as the brave but shy Captain Hornblower. Raoul Walsh (who played John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION) directed, and keeps things moving along briskly. Watch closely for Christopher Lee (before he became a horror film icon) as a Spanish pirate who has a brief swordfight with Peck.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	One interesting aspect of CHARLY is that, altho it was based on a Hugo-winning story from a science fiction magazine, there was nothing in the advertising to suggest that it is SF. That image of Cliff Robertson and Claire Bloom sitting by a pond is about as un-science fictional as you can get. Fortunately, the film is from an era when SF movies consisted of far more than spaceships and big explosions and is, for the most part, intelligently done. The final third is rather pretentious and is at odds with the tone of the earlier scenes, but the film's good points make it well worth seeing. (And Daniel Keyes' original short story is well worth reading.)
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	One of Preston Sturges' best but least known films stars Dick Powell as an ordinary guy who becomes the victim of a prank and thinks he has won a slogan-writing contest. Altho the events are fairly predictable, this does not detract from the laughs. As with all Sturges films, plenty of fine old character actors (including, as always, William Demarest) are on hand. Why doesn't anyone make 67 minute movies anymore?
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	0	This 1955 epic was a commendable effort by producer George Pal to give the public a more-or-less realistic look at what space travel might be like a few decades ahead, with no monsters and aliens and all that. But the result is a film that is MORE dated, and less enjoyable, than SF films made even earlier which DID have monsters and aliens and all that. Almost every character is a corny stereotype, including the inevitable crude -but-basically-smart funny guy from Brooklyn. The film includes two memorably ridiculous plot contrivances.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	1	If you saw FIELD OF DREAMS, well, this is the sci-fi version of it, with a woman building a spaceship instead of a man building a baseball diamond. Like so many movies in all genres in recent years, it is overblown and pretentious, actually fantasy with the trappings of science fiction. It is technically excellent, of course. Movies with multi-million dollar budgets generally are. If you are looking for a movie that is really Serious with a capital S, don't miss this one. It is serious, all right, but it is not much fun.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	0	A rather obvious rip-off of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this dreary SF effort gives us John Carradine as a grim wise guy (oops, I mean wise man) from another planet who arrives on Earth to give us the usual warning, while befriending a child as a sideline. His spaceship looks like a giant golf ball, and his major weirdness is that he often appears in negative form. Carradine is good in the title role, but the film is otherwise a dud.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	0	This entertaining Fifties SF thriller is a good example of a film in which several things do not make much sense, but the plot moves along so briskly, with never a dull moment, that this flaw is easy to forgive. It is derived from the British TV miniseries "The Trollenburg Terror" (which I suspect makes things clearer). A U.N. man (Forrest Tucker) arrives in a Swiss Alps village to investigate mysterious happenings which turn out to be caused by evil extraterrestrials who look like giant brains with thin tentacles around the edge and a big eye in the middle. One or two gruesome moments involving severed heads were sometimes cut for TV showings, but are included in the video, of course. The fact that Prof. Crevett looks like Groucho Marx, and that the hero and heroine step outside "for a breath of fresh air" in the final scene, even though several giant deep-fried dead blobs are lying all over the place, should not prevent you from taking this film seriously; well, not totally, anyway.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	If you are looking for a film with John Barrymore at the peak of his talent, before he deteriorated into a parody of himself, this is the one. Barrymore plays an aggressive lawyer caught in a professional dilemma which almost pushes him to suicide. The film is based on a play by Elmer Rice and, except for an establishing shot of the Empire State Building, is set entirely inside an office. But, surprisingly, it does NOT have a cramped, stagebound feel to it, mainly due to the gripping nature of the story. Not to be missed.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	0	1	Altho not a good film, this effort from the very end of Universal's SF/horror cycle deserves a footnote for establishing, more or less, the minor sub-genre of the horror western. (There actually had been a few films in the Thirties which fit into this category, but they were forgotten by virtually everyone until being released on home video.) Michael Pate (a sort of sinister James Coburn) is effective in the role of a vampire menacing folks on a ranch. This particular vampire is perfectly capable of walking around in the sunshine (hey, no fair!) and the fact that the climactic destruction of the vampire takes place in broad daylight greatly lessens the film's effect. Worth a look for horror fans, however.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	This remains one of the all time best feature films from the Disney studio. An unreliable but likeable old Irishman gets in trouble with the leprechauns, causing plenty of amusing (and even scary) complications. Albert Sharpe is excellent in the title role, as is Sean Connery, in one of his earliest roles, as the handsome hero. Special effects are excellent. The hilite of the film is the banshee, which plenty of kids in 1959 (including this one) found plenty scary.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	The vast majority of science fiction films of this period were aimed at the younger set, but here is an exception. This is a gripping and quite believable &quot;possibly end of the world&quot; story set in London, with a newspaper background. The emphasis is on the characters rather than spectacular special effects, and the &quot;beatnik riot&quot; sequence, in which rioters deliberately waste their most precious commodity (water) is scary and memorable. I did not particularly appreciate this film when I saw it at age 10, but I do now. Probably one of the 25 all-time best SF films. (Watch for young Michael Caine in a bit part.)
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	As far as I know, this British gem from 1945 was the first &quot;anthology&quot; horror film, and is still probably the best. (This is progress?) The framing device involves an architect who is invited to spend a weekend at a country estate. When he arrives, he begins to feel he has experienced all this before, in a dream. The various guests then tell their own stories (all dramatized in flashbacks) of bizarre and possibly supernatural events in their own lives, mainly to convince a skeptical, materialistic psychologist. Ironically, the psychologist eventually tells the most bizarre story of the five! Unlike most other anthology films, this one ties the stories together in a weird climax which finally suggests that the whole thing is starting all over again, in an endlessly repeating circle.
A1BG19L6SA12RS	1	1	Rather archaic, and a bit difficult to sit through, this is still a fascinating film. On re-screening it recently, I found that some scenes had lingered in my memory for 43 years. Death takes human form temporarily to satisfy his curiosity about why we humans fear him so much. During his "holiday", no one dies. The idea that a moratorium on death for a few days would not become immediately obvious and would not cause screaming headlines worldwide cannot be taken seriously, nor can the entire film. (Check out the climactic announcement, "He is -- Death!!" Very melodramatic.) This is a film that requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but if you do so, you will enjoy it. Fredric March was an unusual choice to portray Death, but he does his typically fine job. Science fiction writer Fred Pohl has said that seeing this film in his early teens caused him to not fear death.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	0	0	I was so close to buying this game: it was in my cart and I was about to check out. But then I was was reading reviews to see what other games people who liked this game might recommend, only to find out about the malware called Securom. So I did a bit more research...Thanks, but no thanks. Why does Amazon even sell malware like this?!? It is reprehensible.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	I admit I had very low expectations from Zombie Strippers. I have recently seen a lot of bad attempts at horror-comedy, such as the atrocious Splatter Beach, and I expected no better from Zombie Strippers. To my surprise, it was funny, and gory, and had decent acting (far above par for the genre), and good writing, and the special effects were inventive and well done. In fact, the only thing that prevents it from being classified along with such classics like Evil Dead and Re-Animator is that there is no single standout performance (like Bruce Campbell or Jeffrey Combs). But really, that's a faint criticism. Zombie Strippers is probably the best campy horror movie I have seen in quite a while, and the best horror comedy I have seen in a very, very long time.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	2012 is an amazing movie. The catastrophic special effects are absolutely amazing, and the story is hilarious. I was either laughing or exclaiming with surprise at the disasters the whole way through this movie. This was the funniest, most unusual comedy I have seen in the last couple of years.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	0	We watch a lot of bad movies. Some are good, most are bad, and some are really bad. I expected Arachnia to fall into the "really bad" category. I was surprised to discover that Arachnia is actually a fun, low-budget monster movie. The monsters are large spider-like stop-motion creations, like something from the 1950s. Other than a lack of color (the monsters are uniformly grey-brown), the special effects are reasonably well done for a low budget movie. The characters are distinctive, the acting is not too shabby for a low-budget film, and the writing is actually pretty good. We chuckled several times, not just at the movie, but with the movie. There are even a few nude scenes, but rather than the awkward, uncomfortable to watch, overtly sexual and yet completely non-erotic scenes you get in movies like Final Examination, Arachnia has a sense of innocent fun. One of the times we laughed was actually during one of the nude scenes, and this was not a "laughing because it is so bad" moment, but a moment of intentional humor. How rare that is!So, for just plain fun, I give this movie four out of five stars.Trivia: Arachnia was made by Edgewood Studios, the same Vermont folks who gave us Timechasers.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	Apparently some people have chosen to interpret the theme of James Cameron's Ferngully remake, Avatar, as racist.The theme of the outsider who arrives, becomes an insider, and then helps save them, is about as anti-racist a theme as one is likely to find. The Thirteenth Warrior had the same theme (Arab becomes accepted among barbarians), as did the recent remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (alien decides not to destroy humanity). Even Twilight has a touch of that theme. This theme goes back at least as far as Beowulf (a Geat hero among Danes -- and the story which inspired The Thirteenth Warrior), if not further.People who cherry-pick their examples only to include races against which they have a grudge, and then use that as evidence of some kind of racist message, really need to examine their motives, imo. The message isn't about "race" at all. It's about crossing cultural boundaries. It's about synthesis.Yes, the human "saviour" in Avatar could do things the Na'vi couldn't -- because he would do them. He was not constrained by their assumptions about what was possible or proper (praying to the tree/planet/god, capturing a big red bird, etc.). But anyone who thinks that the Na'vi did not also teach him things completely misses the point. He was able to accomplish more as one of the Na'vi than he could ever have done as a human -- and not just because he was big and blue.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	This show is brilliant. The character development and the writing are about the best I have ever seen in a television show. The only weak point is the ending. Take my advice and stop the last DVD about 30 minutes before the end, and make up your own ending. It will be better than the one they used, which is lame and stupid and disappointing.Even so, I am giving it 5 stars, because despite the lame, stupid, disappointing ending, it is still one of the best TV shows I have ever seen.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	I use computers for my job, and I started getting pain in my hand in the mid 1990s. I tried a lot of mice and trackballs from every manufacturer, and never found one that was completely satisfactory until I found this model a number of years ago. The shape and the button placement is completely ergonomic, the roller ball is under your fingertips (which have evolved for fine control) and the main button is under your thumb (which has evolved for repetitive tasks and simple movement). It's perfect. No other trackball comes close.My only criticism is that the transmitter base is really big, just as it was in the earliest cordless trackballs back in 2000. One would think they could make a smaller transmitter by now that doesn't need a long cable. But I'd rather they stick to what works than try to convince them to update the transmitter -- I'm afraid they would tinker with the trackball itself, which is perfect just as it is.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a surprisingly funny and equally surprisingly touching take on the hillbilly horror genre. Tucker and Dale are good-natured good old boys who encounter a band of rowdy college kids in the woods. There is a misunderstanding based on certain prejudices that both groups have, and hilarity ensures. It's a very gory movie, but in case it's also very funny. Hard to believe, but true. Unlike a lot of movies of this type, it is even funny on repeated viewings. If you get the Blue-Ray or DVD, make sure to watch it again later with the commentary.
A1BG2Z071TYO7P	1	1	This is a good value: a durable metal sprayer for a reasonable price. I installed this in the spring, and it is now winter: have had no trouble with this at all during that time. I recommend this product.
A1BG6EWZT02DWC	0	0	I bought this movie because Gregory Smith is such a phenomenal actor, but I was deeply disappointed with it. The movie itself was very frustrating and slow-going. The premises just seemed nonsensical: a troubled girl who's lazy parents have given up trying to discipline her so they send her to some remote boot camp and her boyfriend somehow gets himself sent to the same camp to try to rescue her (yeah right).While I realize this film was most likely meant to put into light the crappy treatment that people receive at boot camps like this, the film just seemed to be lacking any real depth. I'm not sure if it was just poor writing or just too many characters and craziness going on.In the end, I paid a steep price for a film with little substance, absolutely NO extras on the entire DVD, and I felt mostly like I just wanted the 2 hours of my life back I spent on it.
A1BG6EWZT02DWC	1	1	Week after week I watched this show as it initially aired and it never disappointed! The show spans every age, religion, race and creed. My parents love watching it for Chevy Chase's slap-stick humor while I started watching it because of Joel McHale's fantastic run on The Soup and I ended up falling in love with Donald Glover and Danny Pudi as Troy & Abed! Each character grows more funny and more lovable as the season continues.But what makes this DVD set really stand out from others is the copious amount of extras: four extensive gag reels (one on each disc), highlight reels, commentary on every episode, a producers cut extended episode, and Abed's mini episodes, not to mention there's a Kick-Puncher comic book tucked inside!!It's definitely one of the best sets I've ever purchased and recently Donald Glover said that most stores are sold out of the copies because they printed what they thought would last 6-8 weeks and it sold so fast it only lasted one week! It's impossible to be disappointed with this show and for the price they're charging, I almost bought 2 copies, one to loan out to my stubborn friends and the other to constantly keep with me to watch on repeat! You won't regret buying it!
A1BG6EWZT02DWC	0	0	I got this movie on a whim that Amy Adams is generally adorable and the premises seemed sweet. After viewing it I find it incredible funny and ironic that the main review states it's a "Delightful, relatable romantic comedy." In the end there was very little romance OR comedy, and it certainly wasn't relatable!!While I realize this movie is classified as a Rom-Com I was hoping for something less predictable and I was definitely expecting the main characters to have some kind of chemistry. In the end, Amy's character spent the whole movie trying to find her boyfriend of 4 years to propose to him, while this deplorable jackass she hires to get her to Dublin (where the bf is staying) berates her and puts her through a nightmare of things. They are constantly arguing, fighting, and at once point she yells at him that she hates him. There is absolutely NO chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode (the cab driver/pub owner taking her to Dublin). While this movie is only a little more than 90 minutes long, I felt like I was watching something more the length of Avatar or Titanic. Boring and painful to get thought...***Spoiler Alert Below**With that said, I'd like to point out that in the movie Amy's character has been with her boyfriend for 4 years and he's a handsome, charming doctor. Yes, he can't spend all his time fawning all over her, he's a doctor for crying out loud. But we also don't get to see the beginning of the relationship and how things progressed. He's wealthy, smart, handsome and in the end she dumps him for the broke pub owner and moves to Ireland. Who does that? No one, that's who. Skip this movie unless you're a masochist. It felt more like an unromantic tragedy.

A1BGMNBCGV43WE	0	0	Having just seen this movie on DVD, I'm glad I didn't pay full price at the theater. It is one of the worst major motion pictures ever made.Does that sound like hyperbole, particularly given its rave reviews by all and sundry? Not a bit of it. Here's why.The story is nonexistent. I had no idea what it was about. Apparently, it has something to do with the Joker's plot to take over Gotham City via bank robberies, the murder of top officials, and blowing up buildings. Such a plan is absurd on the face of it, and entirely inconceivable, but, in any event, it is never made clear. I was continually at sea. The first sequence involving the bank heist is so full of improbabilities as to be laughable, and that tone is maintained throughout the film.And, speaking of the Joker, Ledger's performance is so crazed, manic and obviously drug-fueled, that the character is unbelievable even in the context of a blatant fantasy. He is somewhat interesting on screen, granted, but only in a clinical way. He never seems to realistically connect with the events around him, fantastic as they are. (The constant tongue-thrusting Ledger shows is often seen in individuals under the influence of drugs, by the way.) I see his performance as nothing but a bad caricature of a misquided attempt to define the Joker's persona in terms of burlesque. I was embarrassed for him.The pseudo-philosophizing between Batman and the Joker ("You complete me," the Joker says) borders on the ludicrous. I suppose these exchanges were meant to show they are two sides of the same coin (note the coin motif throughout), but they come across as heavy-handed and unconvincing. I imagine the screenwriters thought they were into something really deep here, but it would be laughed out of a sophomore philosophy class in nothing flat.On a more technical level, I found much of the dialogue to be unintelligible, what with the mumbling and whispering by the actors and the constant drone of the musical score in the background. Gary Oldman's speech was particularly impenetrable. I couldn't even read his lips due to his mustache. I was especially distraught that I was unable to understand a word of his final paean to the Batman at the end of the film. Maybe that would have defined the whole enterprise for me, at last. Maybe then I could have looked back and appreciated what the filmmakers were trying to do. Not. Just kidding.Well, there's a lot more (the constant explosions, the disconnect from scene to scene, the improbable behavior, et al., ad nauseam), but you get the idea. It's a train wreck of a movie and, quite literally, a crashing bore. What did the public see in this mess?
A1BGMNBCGV43WE	1	1	I bought the DA-307 several weeks ago when my 20 y/o XLR-800 finally gave out. It had always given such a good close shave that I was skeptical that a new one would do as well. I was wrong: the DA-307 is even better! It's the closest, most comfortable shave I've ever gotten from an electric. It's also lighter, less noisy and more maneuverable than the old one. Just remember to use no more than moderate pressure, keep both heads flat to the face (don't tilt at an angle) and clean the heads at least once a week. Observe these simple rules and you'll get the best shave you've ever had.

A1BGMNBCGV43WE	0	1	Gerald's game is handcuffing his wife to the bed while he has his carnal way with her. One day, she suddenly gets tired of it, kicks him in the balls, and he drops dead with a heart attack. She remains shackled to the bed, watching while a stray dog eats his corpse. But he deserves it, because he is a sexual pervert, an ambitious lawyer, a moderately heavy drinker, a Republican, a soft and doughy creature with a little penis, and several other attributes of the American male which author King clearly despises. The female, on the other hand, proves to be a hardy, intelligent and resourceful heroine who triumphs in the end, after undergoing the tortures of Hell, not the least of which is reliving her own father's sexual abuse of her as a child. Thus King is baldly stating his proto-feminist sociopolitical philosophy for all to see in this bloody, disgusting and vulgar travesty of a novel. It is a perfect example of why I stopped reading King many years ago, amounting to nothing more than an awful self-indulgent mess which assuredly no publisher would have touched but for the reputation of its author. Mr. King should be ashamed of himself. Is this how he wants his children to remember him?
A1BGOCFJ71JOGJ	1	1	These fellas are at the top of their game. From beginning to end Helta lets you know what's up and they stick together. Much respect to these fellas, but they need more air play let the world know what's real hip hop and what isn't. Keep on keepin on fellas. Who ever does your beats needs to go talk to Method Man and help him out a little.
A1BGOCFJ71JOGJ	1	1	Black Rob is Biggie come back from the dead. This album is fire from beginning to end. At first you believe that WHOA! would be the only cut on here that makes your head bob, but nah, track after track after track is crazy hot. Much respect to B.R. this album is up there with Chronic, All Eyes on Me, and Life after Death..instint classic. I garuantee that you will not be disappointed if you buy the album.
A1BGOZVS1RQWVK	1	1	Duke a werewolf and Earl a vampire are driving through a small town and stop to eat at a diner. Gil's All Night Diner. Here they meet the manager Loretta. Well it seems Loretta is having problems with zombies breaking in and destroying her cafe at night. Duke and Earl decide they will help her out. Eventually this innocent stop brings them into a whole war against the Ancient Gods who are trying to come up through the portal, which happens to be in the middle of the diner. The Ancient Gods are having a lot of help from a teenage girl who practices the dark arts and her dopey and hormone happy boyfriend.This was a great light read. The werewolf and vampire were not at all like what I normally read in paranormal books. These two were like good ole country boys. Duke is overweight with a gut and Earl is a stringbean. Earl actually falls in love with a ghost from the cemetary across the street. And of course you have the indifferent sherrif and just for good measure a ghost dog. It was a fun and enjoyable read.
A1BGOZVS1RQWVK	1	1	This book is about Elena who is a werewolf. She decides to live in the big city and get away from the pack and try to live a normal life. Her current boyfriend has no idea she is a werewolf and things seem to be working out ok until: she gets a call to come back to the pack for an emergency.She does return and her life is in much turmoil while she is there. She finds things out about herself that she has been afraid to admit.There is action, a good plot and a nice romantic twist to the book. I liked the book a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal (werewolf) stories with romance.
A1BGOZVS1RQWVK	1	1	Marisa the main character is at a carnival. She goes into the tent to see the vampire on display. Somehow she cuts herself. This awakens the long sleeping vampire. Soon, the vampire kills his keeper and goes after Marisa for his own. Along come Grigori who is after the killer vampire. By the way, Grigori is also a vampire himself. Also along comes Edward a human vampire slayer. He decides its his duty to protect Marisa while he is also falling in love with her. But, to his dismay she is falling in love with Grigori. It is action packed with romance. Love the story and loved the characters.
A1BGOZVS1RQWVK	1	1	This was such a great read. I laughed on and off all the way through it. Belle the main character is a total screwup. The book starts with her resume which in itself is hysterical. She is doing the best she can to support herself and her father. She dearly loves her dad and will take most any job to help pay for his special care in a facility where her dear old dad chases the women confined there. She is slipped a potent cocktail which gives her master over the four elements. Her learning the elements she has and how to control them is a riot. You can just imagine what she is going through while setting things on fire accidentally or by stirring up hurricane winds. I fell in love with this character and with the man who originally was set on killing her. Instead he decides to save her from all the evil doers out there trying to get her. They are quite a match those two. I can hardly wait for the sequel to this. If it is anything like this first book I know I will just have to get it.
A1BGXSGW99TO9P	1	1	Not sure what it is about this movie but I love it. I feel there is lots of action, mystery, thrills, and chills to meet anyone's demands. This movie is really starting to make me believe that Justin Timberlake actually has acting talent. The idea of buying everything on time to me tells people to not take for granted what they have as you may only have it for a short time before it is gone. Being only 28 years old I couldn't imagine living in a world like that; although somewhat similar to this world, you don't die here if you run out of money. Its an edge of your seat fun movie and I really enjoyed watching it with my wife. If you have a surround sound turn it up as this movie blasts some awesome sounds out throughout the entire movie. This is a good movie to watch on a Saturday night with the misses.
A1BGXSGW99TO9P	1	1	What can be said about the first movie in a series that has captivated millions that hasn't already been said? To me this is what started my interest in the series and has kept me hooked ever since. I own all the movies in the series on bluray and I enjoy countless hours watching them with my family. If your looking for some good PG level fun then this movie could be of interest to you, however be warned it has 3 movies that follow and you will want to watch them as well.
A1BGXSGW99TO9P	1	1	Like any blueblooded child of the 80's I was elbow deep into Transformers from day one. When in kindergarten I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up and I always responded with a transformer. I can remember playing for hours endlessly with my transformers. While watching this movie in theaters that all came rushing back; so much so that I watched it at the pre-release and 3 times on release date. The day it came out on HDDVD I bought a HD DVD player for my 360 just to watch it. When it came out on bluray I watched it then. I also bought it on DVD at one point as well. Needless to say my son and I enjoy watching the entire series.
A1BGXSGW99TO9P	1	1	I felt that this was a decent movie. I am biased though as I am a scifi/horror movie nerd. I liked the idea that vampires had taken over and were using humans as livestock. While taking over every aspect of what we see as human life. I feel that what this movie may have lacked in big explosive action it made up in storyline. It was a very enjoyable movie and I watch it quite often to this day.
A1BH2Z0H0LEW5A	0	1	I got one of these to use in a hotel room without a stove or microwave. But I didn't like it. It didn't heat the water hot enough. It was never quite hot enough for the tea to properly brew--just lukewarm.
A1BH5R0XN5RTAR	0	0	This book had all the answer already written in it and the previous owner wrote all about her current love life on the inside of the cover.
A1BH5R0XN5RTAR	0	0	I bought 3 bags of these treats and they didnt work at all!!! My dog loved them as treats but they did not make a difference with my dogs urine burning the grass. I would not buy again!
A1BHNI68XZ06P6	0	1	Funny... I agree with the guy who commented on the bizarre cover art too! The owl is beautiful, but what was the artist thinking/doing with the ground behind him? Obviously wanted to highlight the feet/claws but what the heck is that gulley/valley there? Ha ha!Anyway, as for the comments on the album, yeah.. it's absolutely last in my list of recommendable Rush albums, and I have them all. Sorry guys, there's no point in giving ratings if you're going to give them all 5 stars. If you have limited funds, buy this last, if at all. I agree with the comments that this album is only a footnote in time where future great collaborators met for the first time. Geddy's voice... indeed.. he was trying to find it. If you've heard everything Rush has ever done and love them like I do, and have a few bucks to spare, absolutely get this album. In that context, you'll probably appreciate it a lot since it does color in the chapter in Rush's history between Rutsey and Peart. I don't know if I would be so cruel as to give it 1 star, but it's not a 5 star effort, and I'm sure our bud's from Canada would agree, Ay? ;-)PS: Full disclosure, my fave Rush was from 2112 through Permanent Waves, just because that's the period where they did 'theme' albums. Moving Pictures is undoubtedly their best album ever but although the most kick-axx album ever, it was a little sad to see the extended theme album concept go by the wayside. Signals and onwards are all super awesome as well, but marked the rise and fall of Geddy's infatuation with synth's which for a time had Alex a bit frustrated as his guitar playing became pushed back in the mix (as he had to simplify his guitar lines in order for them to be heard over the synth work). I loved even that stuff but being a guitar player myself, I still go back to the earlier work where Alex's guitar lines were at their most epic.
A1BHNI68XZ06P6	1	1	Live at Bonnaroo is perhaps my favorite CD in the entire Warren Haynes/Government Mule catalog. The naked, unprocessed, raw honesty of his performance at Bonnaroo is such a breath of fresh air. I saw a couple of reviews here saying his mastery of the acoustic guitar was not that which he has on the electric. For shame, for shame. Would we compare Warren's electric playing to that of Van Halen or Satriani? Not me. Should we compare his acoustic playing to Paco de Lucia or Chet Atkins? Nope. His playing on these songs is exactly what is called for by the SONGS themselves. Anyone questioning his abilities on the instrument (be it electric OR acoustic) is clearly misguided. He's doing what a good musician does.. letting his playing serve the song, and these songs don't call for 6-string pyrotechnics. Anyway, buy this album and you will NOT be disappointed. I'm not lying when I tell you I bought 5 copies of this and have given them to my friends. It is that good. For me, "Beautifully Broken" is the highlight and even better than the original GM version. That's just my opinion, and we all know about 'opinions'. ;-) Anyway.. to be repetitive, BUY THIS ALBUM!! Oh, and thanks Warren for being the humble greatness that you are!!PS: If you want a glimpse into Warren's character, search You Tube for "Warren Haynes - Beautifully Broken in HD" by the user LorriMPhoto. Some girl jumps up on stage with Warren and rather than having her removed he lets her stay on stage with him and even alters the lyrics at the finale to include her name "Carrie Ann". The mark of a great man is how he treats people. Warren is not just a great musician, he is a truly great and humble human being.
A1BHT21KXELQBC	1	1	This game is the best game available now,for any system. All you people who diss it are either Cube-haters, stupid, or haven't played it. The sound track on this game is excellent. Especially the music when fighting Metroid Prime's first form, if you have a sub-woofer. The graphics are out of this world. They outperform any game on any console. I don'tknow how, but they do. The framerate runs at a dazzaling 60 frames per second, with no slowdown, ever. And there are no annoying loading and wait times during this game either. This game is the best game for the Gamecube, and Zelda will have to work extremely hrd if it want's to beat it. Don't miss this one. This game alone is worth the price of a Gamecube. It's like the best game from 3 years in the future fell through a time warp. Buy it now.
A1BHT21KXELQBC	1	1	I was this movie in IMAX 3D first, and let me tell you, it was flat out amazing. The 3d effects are the best I've seen so far, and this film makes very good use of IMAX technology. I then saw it about a week later in an ordinary movie theater. Good, but it wasn't even the same experience as in IMAX. When the train comes, the IMAX theater shook. See this movie, it's a christmas classic. And if at all possible, see it in IMAX 3D, it's well worth the trip. IMAX 3D brings out the best in this film.
A1BHX2EI9TNB79	0	1	This book was just okay. It was pretty boring until about three quarters of the way through. I will probably never read this book again. It is a little depressing, but you can tell that from the title and I didn't love the style of writing. I do like other works by Fitzgerald but this one I did not care for as much.
A1BIJ7LPIC4X14	1	1	i'm not much of a gamer, but when i do use this mouse it's excellent. you can set the buttons to change sensitivity in a flash and makes it great when i have different objects and things to do. Also wonderful for photoshop when you need to do 100% image edits and need just a smidge of editing when a slight of hand. I do wish however that it would have been more sensitive, but it's quite useable at the most sensitive settings
A1BIJ7LPIC4X14	0	0	When I tried it, I was able to see an image on my monitor. However no matter which monitor I tried it out on, the lcd would always come out yellow. I tried another type of cable (dvi to hdmi) and colors looked normal. So I'm guessing it's just the adapter that's giving me these problems.
A1BILOXS6G1CVC	1	1	I just got the DVD from amazon.com, and I can't believe how awsome it is. Better still, it comes with a Spanish track, which makes it even more wonderful to watch for those of us who speak the language. It rivals ANY large scale movie made in Hollywood. It's beauty is infinite. MY only regret is that it doesn't come with an English and a French track. The Spanish dubbing is magnificient. I'm sure if there were more foreign movies dubbed in Eglish, people would get used to the dubbing (like they are everywhere else in the world), and films like The Emperor and the Assassin would get the audience they disserve. If you think Gladiator is great, this movie is MUCH greater.Thanks amazon.com for allowing me to have this DVD in my collection.
A1BIRTYII4C11K	0	1	Whatever happened to the kickass sountrack? Not the score, but the album that had Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Divinyls and Blondie among others? For such a suckie movie, the soundtrack was pretty cool. Where is it? I only have a copy on vinyl.
A1BIRTYII4C11K	1	1	After almost twenty years from its original release date, I still listen to this soundtrack. Some of the songs are dated (rather instantly too) but the songs that you bought the album for are still incredible to this day.
A1BIZ4KL4M2FHY	0	1	Similar to others...I've been through 2 of these sanders. I'm kind of stuck as all of my dust collection is setup for the PC hookup(why can't we have universal connections on a tool where DC is so imperative, I will never know). Suppose we have to understand that a sander is a continuous use tool and expectations may need to be reduced for longevity. I do woodworking as a side job and I have had other sanders seize up as well.
A1BIZ4KL4M2FHY	1	0	Initially, more optimistic...after following his strategy for the last 6 months, my opinion has changed.ITWO, CALL, FORD, SGTL. These are just a few of the wonderful stocks that have lost me almost 1/2 of my initial investment. Yes, it hasn't been pretty for me. I've lost a significant amount of money on his "picks."Admittedly, the author tells you that it is a long term strategy(3-5 years). However, he also makes it a point that over the course of nearly 20 years, his strategy has NEVER been outperformed by the market averages in a single year. In fact, his tables in his book essentially show you that year after year after year, his stocks would almost destroy the market averages every year. Strange luck would have it that I would invest during the only time over 20 years where the opposite would be true. I guess I do have another 6 months to stick with the program. Not sure if I should as I think either a. he lied about the data in his book or at least b. molded and shaped the data to his liking.Gosh, I wish people would stick to facts. Like the book, hate the book...please stick to truth.And, the truth is this...the website the author refers to is FREE. It doesn't cost a dime. I have seen references eluding to the fact that the author tried to con people into spending money on his website. Simply not true.
A1BIZSAL0CZHDH	1	1	Got hooked on Socom I, and loved it. Same deal with Socom II. Now with Socom III, it's even better. Very similar to PC games like Counterstrike now. Unfortuanately I don't get to play as much as I'd like anymore, but when I do, it's easy to kill a few hours at a time. They did a great job with the new game, and I can't wait for future versions down the road!
A1BIZSAL0CZHDH	1	1	Every 6 mos. I go in for a cleaning, and everytime my hygienest lectures me to floss more often.Last year, they gave me a plastic thing in the past, where you wrap floss onto it. I used it for a bit, but gave up because it was too wide and didn't fit in the back of my mouth. The floss would also come loose, no matter how many times I looped it around, or how tightly I pulled it.After my last cleaning, about a month ago, they gave me one as a free sample. I finished up the refills and I love it. I need some refills now, and looking around, I haven't seen it at the Target or Walgreens that I happened to look. I've looked online, and dang the refills are pretty pricey. I think it's worth it though, so I'll be shelling out for some refills here soon...
A1BJ0Q6PKV7PT9	1	1	I just bought one of these at BJ's for $39.95 - I've used it for about 2 weeks and am so very happy with it - light - powerful - quiet! Not often one product can get so many things right! Even at Amazon's $59.95 price, I'd recommend it!
A1BJ0Q6PKV7PT9	0	0	Do NOT buy this game -- SEND EA a message -- it uses DRM == YOU DO NOT OWN THE GAME == IT IS EQAUL TO RENTING IT!! (for $50!@#!) AVOID AVOID
A1BJ0Q6PKV7PT9	0	0	A previous reviewer, RT, must be confused with another product -- THIS product is a joke -- EVERYTHING I have EVER purchased from Kong has been of flawless quality -- some might even last multiple generations of dogs -- they are that good! When I saw this at the store, I thought it was rather flimsy, I really questioned whether the black "bite down" ends would last but I literally said "Hey, Kong makes it - it'll be good" and bought it... Almost immediately my 6 month old dog began to tear the ends to shreds -- and this was adult-supervised activity -- we never once let her chew on it - the rubber is really thin and "cheapo"... within 4 weeks, the product has become completely useless -- it provided 30, maybe 40 minutes total play time. If your doggy has no teeth, this might be the perfect toy, otherwise you are throwing your money away.
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	1	0	Don't expect an in-depth coverage of the theory behind the calculations. Said that, the book is a "concise" presentation of the programs used to calculate special functions present on the CD. For every program, the author shows the underlying equations and the bibliographic sources, plus nice discussions on accuracy/performance when you have the option of several methods.I would say the book is more useful to the engineer/physicist having to do certain calculations, than to the mathematician/student wanting to learn the ins and outs of special functions theory.The only dissapointment is a rather poor produced CD: the names of the programs on the CD are in 8.3 format, and I think (not sure though) that not all the code of the driver programs shows up on the CD- there are names of program snippets that are not on the CD- this may be an unnecessary hasle for someone trying to follow the examples in the book to the letter.
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	1	1	This is a great reference, with wonderful physical insight into plasma kinetics mechanisms. Unfortunately the astonishing work of the authors is undermined by minor typos from the editor, which may throw off beginners- equations where charges or species don't add up, and the like. I could not find an errata yet, therefore only the 4 stars; but sincere congrats to the authors for such indepth and insightful work.
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	1	0	Obviously, this is a dated book. Nevertheless is very well written, and you still can learn a lot especially from the early days when Linux was still trying to be a *NIX clone, that is before the RedHats and Novells and other commercial successes that steered the new distributions toward Microsoft's ways and paths of doing bussiness- take a simple command, burry it under a nice GUI, and wreak havoc into the old simple ways, shuffling files and paths around so you can boast you ADDED value !One nice thing about this book is that the Caldera in the title is just an example, a suggestion if you will, most of the stuff worked on any other distro of the time almost with no tweaks or arm wrestling. You'd have a hard time today to do the same, but I believe still this book will teach you "to ask the right questions" when you wrestle with your LAN.
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	0	1	Title says it all: either the translator (if this is a translation from german, but I doubt) or the author (I believe actually the latter) do not have enough command of the english language to make it a smooth read. It's a pitty, there are very nice/interesting points of view, and I do not think that just the advanced concepts are to blame for the difficulty of the readout. Any takers out there among the native english speakers nobel laureats to rewrite a classic ?
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	0	0	This is a hotch-potch (hodge-podge?)of mostly previously viewed scenes during BSG seasons, with a bit of "controversial" topless scenes to save face if you into that, and just a couple of really new material about the actual bombing of the colonies. Terrible waste of time, and this from someone who fell hard for BSG the remake. Not only you won't get answers, you won't even get intelligent questions- then eventually I realized none of the former producers is on the credits, and it really shows. Sorry Caprica.
A1BJC5M4CEXL3H	1	1	I was appaled by the editorial review of the movie. Haven't read the book (yet, waiting in my room for soem time now) but the movie is a masterpice of antiwar propaganda. Hard to stomach sometime, but once you are over some of the gruesome (for the 60's movies standards that is) scenes, you will enjoy every moment of the absurdity that was world war 2, of the "great" war.Don't look for a "story", look for ideas. Eventually you will get also the "story"(there: "there is no good war!"). Brilliantly acted and directed, with a short cameo of Orson Welles as the inspecting general.
A1BJDVLIY4R8J9	1	1	I love PD and the video is great online or downloaded. I wish I could put it onto my Coby 4 GB Flash Video MP3 player but cannot convert format because the video is protected. IF you want to purchase an MP3 that is compatible please look under the Customer Service and frequent questions to find the MP3's that will work with Unbox.
A1BJDVLIY4R8J9	0	1	I purchased the Black and Decker F1060 which is designed exactly like the F1000. It is a great iron with lots of nice features WHEN it is together. However, the top pops off the iron. There are clips holding it in to the clear plastic area that holds the water. I am not sure if it pops off just from the heat or if it is because when you turn the dial setting it can cause it to pop off if you turn it slightly past where you should stop. It is not hard to turn it too far. My husband has re glued it twice and maybe that has messed up the settings but I iron a lot of calico since I quilt and want the setting on the highest for cotton. So when turning all the way to the highest setting you can easily turn it too far and therefore it comes apart. Poor design.
A1BJDVLIY4R8J9	0	0	I bought this iron in June 2009. It quit on me this weekend. This winter the auto shut off was failing. I constantly had to unplug and replug the iron in the last few days so that it would reset itself. It is not suppose to leak but it does. The sole plate needs to be cleaned often when you use the high cotton setting and iron dark fabrics. For a Rowenta I expected it to last longer than it did - I didn't even get 2 years out of it. I do not recommend this product!
A1BKA2I8ZIOT05	1	1	Made just like the quality of Delta's top of the line scroll saw. Now I can roll that heavy scroll saw to were I want in the shop. If you need wheels to make your equipment movable to were you can get the most out of a small shop space spend the money. Takes a little effort to bolt it all together but it is so worth the time and money.
A1BKA2I8ZIOT05	1	1	No longer standing in the back as a back up singer for the famious Southern Rock Band Wet Willie. Donna is stepping to the front with a Christian flair soft rock modern blues album... She sings as good as she looks, Smoking.R Hayes bama917
A1BKA2I8ZIOT05	1	1	I think Don King listens to this CD to straighten his hair,, If the tracks these three men lay down doesn't make your hair stand on ends,, well then Who is You ???
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	This is the flatware we have used day-to-day for about four years now, and I still love it. In fact, I'm going to order replacement pieces for the ones that have disappeared over the years, and expand our original set. The weight and balance feels very comfortable in your hand. They are easy to clean. Our pieces have been washed by hand and in the dishwasher, and though they now have faint scratches all over from use, they still shine and look beautiful, just as stainless steel should.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	0	0	My yellow Kitchenaid baster brush bristles melted the first time I used it. I was so chagrined and inexperienced with cooking that I thought I did something wrong, so I was afraid to send it in for a replacement.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	I finished this game over a year ago, and I am still recommending it to everyone I meet. Unfortunately I'm starting to understand why I'm having trouble convincing people - this game just has too much going on. Most people aren't willing to step out of their favorite genre box to try anything this amazing. I get comments like, "I just want to kill stuff and be totally violent" or "I hate stealthing, cause I have no patience", etc.I can't stress enough to you how this game just does everything right. Nothing is too difficult to figure out. You don't get stuck forever hating a boss. You never curse at the controls. To this day, I still love the way you enter letters using a dial instead of the usual "keyboard on screen". The story is very compelling, and it actually drives the game. I especially love taking inventory of the bioresources of each new place with a camera. The characters and environment are interesting in every way - physical appearance, background, psychology, abilities, etc. Music and sound effects are what you need and fit the mood. The gameplay isn't artificially padded with difficult/frustrating things to do to drag out the length of the game. Kills are not superviolent, but totally satisfying. The game is always fun, never work. Stealth is way more optional and shorter wait to return to normal than in "Metal Gear" and other stealth games, therefore actually fun (and even funny - those guys are hilarious). The graphics are beautiful, no errors or overly-contrived things to take away from your immersion in this environment.Whatever your excuse is, (I can hear it now, "I just like cute Mario type games", "I don't like platformers, I like to shoot stuff", "I don't have time for adventure games") just give this a try. All the things that annoy you in other games simply don't exist in this one. As so many others have said here, you won't regret it. I hope the game makers have more chances to make gems like this, games with soul, instead of more mass-marketed junk.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	I've been a fan of Sandra Boynton's musical exploits for a few years now, and I own and have given as gifts all her kids albums. It's hard not to compare them to each other, and I think my favorite songs are in her two earlier albums, "Philadelphia Chickens" and "Rhinoceros Tap".Unlike his jaded mom, my 5-year-old son listens with fresh ears, and he tells me that this is the best album yet. He's at the age where every little twist is hilarious, the fact that the Cow Planet songs have 3 episodes like Star Wars makes him flip. His favorite song right now is "Tantrum", and he has been writing the word on little papers all over the house. My favorite song on the album hasn't been given special mention yet by other reviewers - "Dragonfire" - it reminds me of my son who was born year of the dragon, and I love the lyrics and that warm loving feeling it gives me. The other songs, especially "Dog Train", are growing on me as daily my son keeps requesting replays. Without my son's insistence, I probably wouldn't have given the album a second chance, but I'm enjoying it more and more.I agree with other reviewers that a few of the songs seem to sound much like songs on her previous albums, but all creators have a style which persists throughout their work. She's just done enough stuff for us to recognize her signature.When I play it for kids for the first time, they don't think they ARE kids songs at first, especially "Evermore".The song book and cd format is awesome. My son had my husband pick out the notes on our piano, and he loves the idea of music being written down so you can read it. A great introduction to that concept.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	0	1	This was a truly horrid dvd. I thought it would be entertaining to watch anything Victor Borge did, because of his gentle comedic genious, but this story-reading is awful and boring for kids and adults alike. I really couldn't watch the whole thing.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	0	1	Brought it home. Unpacked it. Spent over 4 hours troubleshooting why it won't work on my home wireless network, with first internet chat then phone support. Escalated to level 2 person. Messed around with every setting imaginable, powered down and powered up every device in every configuration. Even connected the physical cables. Gave up! I followed instructions. Now I'm stuck in a loop after the printer was detected on my network, but the software keeps reasking the same question instead of proceeding as it should. Please save yourself the time, try a different printer. Looks pretty, but gotta take it back... sigh. ** update 3/6/2007 - I purchased the Dell Wireless Photo All-In-One Printer 966. Installation was hassle-free and after two months, I can highly recommend checking this one out as a great alternative.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	0	I hope that this will make it to DVD so I can watch it again. It made a big impression on me when I watched it fifteen years ago as a single college student, and I was wondering how I would react to it this time as a mom of two boys, mid-divorce. I'm so curious, I almost think I might get it and watch it at a friend's house. It's sad to me that great movies like this might stop being viewed and talked about, now that it can't make the online rental queues.I warn you, that probably no men will "get" this movie, and some women won't either. The amazing thing about this movie is that you're either in on the joke or you're not. The joke is dark, not funny. It's about being able to appreciate a point of view.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	This is THE best Peter and the Wolf recording you'll find. Dudley Moore tells the story in a simple and affectionate way that will have you chuckling while being completely accessible and essential to a child's understanding of what's happening in the music. I also love the interpretation given by conductor John Williams and the orchestra - the pacing and clarity of the interweaved musical themes bring vividly to your imagination the characters they represent.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	This is still the best talking globe out there. It is a great investment in your child's education, and it's an incredibly useful reference. It is a very well thought out design, with something to learn for various levels of geographical knowledge. I enjoy playing the Eureka mode, which is a game for finding places on the globe. I love that it gives you smart clues that help you when you're stumped, but doesn't just give the answer away. I love that you can switch it to continents, countries, or states and provinces (but of course as an American, what do I care about Canadian provinces, eh?? hehe). It has a nice collection of interesting facts about each location to explore, and this toy has captured the attention of every person, child or adult, that I have ever shown it to.As for durability, I bought ours 12/2005, and it's still going 3/2010. I don't let the kids (my two boys are 3 and 9 now) throw it around, but it has cracked open slightly once around the equator, and my boyfriend gently put it back together. The stylus sometimes goes haywire if you touch it to your hand or other things it's not meant to point to, but we find if we have good batteries and just push the on button to reset, it generally works fine.
A1BKAHN6SUK9VB	1	1	These aren't the best quality in the world, because the metal doesn't feel completely smooth to the touch, but they are still very attractive and sturdy. They match my metal wire shelving unit perfectly because they are made of the same shiny round steel (which is also not perfectly smooth I am discovering). The other hooks I found at the Container Store that are designed to work with these shelves do clip on a little tighter, but they still wobble, and they don't look like they belong with the shelves, since they are a more muted metal and flat instead of round. I'm using them in my boys' bedroom so they can hang up their many different school bags and video game bags as they come home.
A1BKGO2HVY6UWJ	1	1	I got this CD when it came out. I was in 8th grade, and I wore it out playing it over and over. The great thing about this CD is the versatility. There is a song for every mood or taste. And the lyrics are wonderfully relatable. My personal favorite songs are "Omaha", "Anna Begins", "Perfect Blue Buildings", and "Raining in Baltimore". It's a CD you will be glad to own.
A1BKGO2HVY6UWJ	1	1	This book was great. It was funny and honest and I found myself agreeing with 99% of everything said. Plus, it got me and my husband talking about our issues with each other instead of us silently resenting each other. I could read him an excerpt and it opened the lines of communication. It really helped us to see the other's point of view and now we feel much better about our relationship. I highly recommend!
A1BKGO2HVY6UWJ	1	1	I liked this book. Granted, all of Mary Kay Andrews' books are fluffy, so you have to know that going in. It's no World and Peace. But it was a lighthearted story with likeable characters and a storyline that kept me interested. I actually think this is my favorite of all the Mary Kay Andrews books I've read. Some of her stories can be a bit farfetched, but this one was down to earth and quite enjoyable. I thought it was miles better than Deep Dish or some of her later books.
A1BKLLSLLXGW5O	1	1	Very crisp writing and an intricate plot which will keep you guessing to the very end! I am buying more Jack Reacher as I wat to read them all!This one is a keeper!George L.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	0	0	If you enjoy bands like Creed and Kid Rock and current hard rock/alternative music ignore this review. This is for those who like I, much prefer Phish, Allman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. Pearl Jam used to be my favorite band...My interest in the band faded after Vitalogy, but I decided to pick up this CD because I am going to see them live this summer. I don't want to sound like a 95 year old woman, but to me it sounds like a bunch of noise with little focus. It is very difficult to distinguish each guitar part. It seems like there is so much distortion and reverb on the songs that they all mesh together to form a mass of noise. The slow songs are certainly not up to the standards of anything off of their first three albums. I wasn't expecting another &quot;Ten&quot; but didn't expect a 2 star album.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	This is by far my favortie Grisman/Garcia outing. There are two reasons for this: the phenomenal playing by the two, and the dilogue in between songs that gives this album a uniquely personal feel. For example, as great as the Shady Grove is, Jerry's exclamations of &quot;Oh Gosh, Oh Geez,&quot; and &quot;Smokin!&quot; in reference to their performance made me feel as if I was sitting on the couch at Jerry's place just hanging out listening to two real people pour themselves into the music without studio time to worry about, or overdubs of ny kind. There are plenty of tight songs too, my favorite being &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot; There is a heartfelt &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; which ironically (because of its excellence) Jerry and Dave feel is lame! This is the last (and best) recording of these two musicians playing together- don't let it pass you by.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	I love this CD. Moe did a great job with this studio album even though their jammed out style caters more towards live performance. St. Augustine is one of my favortie songs. 32 Things is very well written and has a live feel to it. All the songs are well done even though the frist half of the album is my favorite. The only problem with this CD is the lame cover art which I really don't like. This CD serves as a great intoduction to Moe.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	What I love most about Scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed. The only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for those who enjoyed &quot;A Go-Go&quot;, this one is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up. This quality funk CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but is a great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here!)
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	Despite what official reviews by AMG, etc. might say, Rift is an exceptional album. This was produced back when Phish blended more compositional style songs (Junta style) with the straight foward radio type songs of say... (Farmhouse). The album holds its theme, (or rather mood) throughout, weaving in and out of Phish classics such as Rift, My Friend, It's Ice, The Wedge, and Silent in the Morning that all blend poignant instrumentals with humorous vocals. The theme is exemplified remarkably well through the artwork. You will probably enjoy this album if you- are looking for eclectic music, large instrumental sections, enjoy Phish type shows (SCI, etc.) You probably won't like this album if you are looking for alternative music, songs that could be found on the radio, distorted guitar.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	I am disapointed by the previous reviews of this box set which documents the final shows at the Fillmore in 1971. These CDs offer insight into one of the bands greatest runs at one of their greatest venues. Now if you've never heard any live grateful dead before, I'd actually recommend starting with &quot;Live Dead,&quot; &quot;Dick's Picks Four,&quot; or &quot;Two From the Vault.&quot; For those who are acquainted with the band in a live setting, these shows are must have. By '71, they were mixing their full-blown psychedelia of the 60's with solid originals off American Beauty, Workingman's Dead, etc. So with this compilation taking the best of five nights, there's plenty to choose from. The last night of the run is widely considered an all-time top show, and the quality here is superior to bootleg versions that any one might find. The Jam&gt;GDTRFB with a Saint Stephen tease is simply awesome. The biggest suprise for me was the third CD, which is incredible, possibly even stronger than the forth. It is from the 28th and consists of a mind-blowing Dark Star&gt;Saint Stephen&gt;NFA&gt;GDTRFB&gt;NFA. The reason I am giving only four stars, as opposed to five is the mediocrity of sections of discs one and two (when compared to the latter two.) But if you enjoy live grateful dead, be sure to pick this set up!
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	Let me first say that Tony Hawk 1 and 2 are groundbreaking games. After reading the other reviews, it's apparent that others are in agreement. The best update from the original game is the level editor. You can even upload and download levels from the internet now. The ability to &quot;manual&quot; in between grinds is probably the 2nd most relevant update from Tony Hawk 1. It allows the skater to extend their lines (series of tricks), in almost infinite ways. The computer version also offers several levels from Tony Hawk 1; not the best ones though as School 1 is omitted. In comparison with the PlayStation version, the PC Tony Hawk is far superior. I'd say I get twice the frame rate as on the PS version. Also there is much less fogging of the background. Another note is that the PC version offers me a much higher capacity than the PS version to design levels, which is invaluable when implimenting risers and blue moves. Overall- I highly recommend Tony Hawk 2, especially the PC or Dreamcast versions. Also be sure to have a controller/joystick, which is essential.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	On Tracking Buffalo, The Big Wu blends clever rhymes with catchy melodies to create an extremely enjoyable CD. They easily differentiate themselves from and possibly supersede other small jam bands with their songwriting and playing ability. The lyrics sometimes have a ballsy triteness in their rhymes that is nothing less than hilarious. My favorite aspect of the CD is how diverse sounding the band is. The Big Wu shifts from G Love/Sublime sounding vocals to a String Cheese sounding acoustic guitar solo to a harmonious &quot;Phil and Jerry&quot; duet jam. The drummer controls the dynamic level quite well and never seems afraid to turn it up a notch when the music calls for it. He is one of the main reasons the jamming sections of the CD don't sound forced, but rather progress naturally. Highlights include Silcanturnitova, Precious Hands, and Red Sky. I strongly recommend this CD for anyone even remotely interested in this genre of music.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	Basically I'd like to support Alan Sandler's review. My only qualm with this set is that with better Dick's Picks out there including 4,8,10,11,12,14,15,16 and 18 to name a few, casual fans would be best to hold off on this one until they amass a decent Dick's Pick's collection. If you have most of those shows, then by all means pick this one up. Phil's bass thunders on Scarlet Begonias, Not Fade Away, and especially Wharf Rat. Also listen for the King Bee tease during the jazzy outro jam of a veteran Weather Report Suite. For those interested, these shows come from a three-night stand at Alexandra Palace in London from 9/9/74 - 9/11/74.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	0	0	After hearing the Big Wu's first album, &quot;Tracking Buffalo through the Bathtub,&quot; I immediately sought out their other music. This being their latest studio CD, I expected a lot. The biggest problem I found was a lack of exciting or even catchy songs. And the playing isn't bad, just a little boring. Supposedly (source from Rhombus Web forums) the producer was going for a &quot;pop&quot; feel, which is accomplished in a polished sound. The problem is, by polishing away the instrumental sections in which the Wu excels, you place the burden on the songwriting. And to reiterate, the straight songs aren't bad, just a bit unexciting. To the album's credit, song 2, &quot;Minnesota Moon&quot; has a real swinging feel to it, which I really enjoy. I'd like to also add that in the context of the band's natural setting (a live performance) some of these songs such as &quot;Boxing Day&quot; are given new life. Still unless you're a die-hard Wu fan and have to own every CD, put this one at the end of your list.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	It isn't often that I come across an album that can soothe as well as excite and amaze me. Everyone on the album shines. Rice uses just the right amount of technicality in his playing to keep me absorbed mentally yet allow me to relax and enjoy the music. I find this album even more exciting and adventurous than his similar 1979 album Manzanita. This whole CD is done without vocals, instead utilizing tons of solos by everyone! The tracks flow quite well together too. This album is probably best suited for any fan of Tony Rice, bluegrass, flat picking, and especially those who love intelligent bluegrass compositions without vocals.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	This program is easy to use and has a great interface, two key points. You can plug your guitar right into your line in slot (foregoing any effects though). This is a great program for anyone who has musical ideas to convey, but has lacked a reasonably priced method of recording them. You get 8 seperate tracks to fiddle with, which proves sufficient in most cases. It comes with the drag and drop drummer lite edition, which is cool at first, but it seems like it is just a ploy to get the user to buy the real edition with an more adequate number of fills and beats. It is time consuming to create each track, but proves worth it in the end. The files can easily be saved as .wavs and burnt to CD. The mp3 encoder is a trial only with 20 uses. This is important because even if you save your files to .wavs, they have security features that prevent them from being encoded into mp3s (even by other programs). One more problem is that you can only begin recording at the beginning of a measure, which can be irritating. Overall though, this product has proved hours (and hours) of fun! (Note this version is not quite outdated, and more recent editions of the program are available).
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	This is a very solid CD by one of the founders of roots reggae. At times, however, it seems slightly overproduced, sophomorically utilizing new effects of the day (1990). Aside from that, most of the songs are great! Stepping Razor (later recorded by Peter Tosh) and Sons of Garvey are my two favorite tracks. Oh Carol, Small Axe, and Blackman Know Yourself are great songs as well, exemplifying Higgs' knack for writing creative and catchy compositions. One should know that the only two CDs currently available by Joe Higgs are this one and Family, which is probably his weakest CD minus the title track. If possible try and seek out his out of print titles &quot;Life of Contradiction, Triumph!, and Unity is Power. Any one of these discs is better in imo than Blackman and Family combined. Still if this is all you can find, do yourself a favor and pick it up before it's out of print too!
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	I first heard Theresa recently in New Orleans at the Red Eye bar. She has been playing free shows there for a little while to larger and larger audiences. I am a tough critic, but really was blown away by her powerful voice and her wonderful violin skills. She reminded me of a slightly edgier, rawer Alison Krauss. After the energy filled show I made sure to pick up &quot;No Regrets&quot;. Honestly, it disappointed me at first. Theresa's voice is more produced sounding than I would have liked. Some of the lyrics are also a little bit happy happy joy joy for my tastes. After a couple of listens though, I got past the sometimes poppy sound and could hear what lay underneath: a solid effort that showcased wonderful vocals and violin. The tunes only grew on me and pretty soon, I was addicted to this CD. Standout tracks include &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; (it sounds more like something from a live New Orleans show), Delirious (incorporating a haunting violin part), and &quot;Love is Colorless&quot; (the catchiest tune). Overall I'd say that from this album shines great talent from an overlooked, under appreciated artist.
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	0	1	Listened to in context, I realize that this is the music of a tortured soul who is genuinely relecting his fragmented psyche through his craft. Without this biography in mind, this live recording sounds like a severely retarded man was altruistically given a chance to play his songs in front of a crowd. The AMG review likens his music to a Van Gogh painting, but the only connection I could see was that while listening, I badly wanted to sever my ears to silence the madness. While that was too drastic a measure, I couldn't help thinking, why me?
A1BKN8GP8MEEP9	1	1	This classic first release from reggae great Joe Higgs has finally been reissued. It was previously available only as an international release. Upon first listen, I immediately noticed a marked improvement in sound quality.For those unfamiliar with the music, it is roots reggae at its best. The songs' melodies are memorable and the message is eternal. But what makes this album truly special? The vocals. Higgs' voice rings with true feeling and a rare sincerity that transform this album from enjoyable to inspiring.The whole album is solid, but standout tracks include:Got to Make a WayLife of ContradictionHard Times Don't Bother MeThere's a RewardAbsent is "More Slavery" and several other tracks, including the dub versions, all of which are present on the international release. I believe this is a faithful reproduction of the album in its original form, but "More Slavery" is a great track and is sadly missed. Still, the core of the album is present and I cannot recommend it enough.
A1BKS08AKOWF8S	1	1	Mr. Parton relates his journey along the path of Christian Evangelicalism to the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (not to be confused with the ELCA). What he finds there and why it is important are presented with the thoughtfulness of an attorney and the humility of a man of faith. There is wonder, awe and clarity in his writing, all rare and refreshing. Mr. Parton does not demean the practioners of other denominations but points to the strengths of the LCMS and how it has reinforced his faith and his personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Any Christian searching for direction will benefit by reading this book.
A1BKS08AKOWF8S	0	0	This is an incredibly disappointing "work." Any true reader of Tolkien will marvel at the shallowness of this critique of his trilogy. I wonder if the authors did any more than peruse the book or, at best, speed-read through it to write this drivel. God is indeed present in Tolkien's work but this book is no road map to finding Him there. Far superior is "The Gospel Acording to Tolkien" by Ralph C. Wood. I would also suggest that serious readers pick up the Tolkien's "Silmarillion" in which God's act of creation literally leaps off the first page. Bruner and Ware would also do well to read this to deepen their own knowledge.
A1BKWMCU4QC8T3	0	1	The question is how bad do you want all the boxed sets together and not the heads. I hate them that much. I hate to buy the same dvd twice but it is my favorite show and worth it in the end. And like many others have said one of the best seasons.
A1BKWMCU4QC8T3	1	1	Well after seeing the 1 star reviews I was forced to write a review of my own. To not understand this movie is amazing. It is made so that ANYONE can watch and understand what is happening. May not be the best re-release but the movie itself is priceless. AWESOME.
A1BL2TCE749NB8	1	0	I've come across this book quite by accident. I was looking for a book on the Viet Nam war, which I had taken part in as a US Army, helicopter gunship commander. The date leaped off the page,23 Mar, 2003. I knew this terrible place. You see, my son a young Marine Sgt. was killed in this action. It truely was a horribly misdirected mission from start to the terrible ending. It illustrated how commanders sitting in a tent many clicks away can misdirect an action so badly that it results in a unit almost being wiped out. The after action report was one of denial, misrepresented facts and outright lies. Having been a combat veteran myself I recognized all the elements that can go terribly wrong in an operation when the completion of the mission gets in the way of judgement and common sense. This is a story that needed to be told,if not to prevent this from happening again,but to honor those young Marines who died fighting against a larger well trained enemy,cut off from all help and fired upon my friendly forces aircraft. There were many heroes that day that went unmentioned, until they were laid to rest, there bodies draped in the flag they gave their lives for.BRIAN J REISS,CPT,US ARMY,RETGUNSHIP PILOT, VIET NAM 68-69
A1BL2TCE749NB8	1	1	After upgrading my desktop computer, I discovered I had a cooling problem. I choose this fan due to its size and low noise ratio. A quick cut in the case allowed for placement of the fan and it connected to the current plugs. The fan was very quiet and I really don't even hear it run. The increase in cooling was a great advantage as this fan is larger than the installed case fans. It has solved my cooling problems and then some. I would highly recommend this fan.
A1BL2TCE749NB8	1	1	Contrary to popular thought there really was a Muc Wa. Why do I make this bold statement? Because I was one of the gunship fireteams that flew in support of Muc WA many times. We were the last airfield in the Delta and the closest support to Muc Wa. The men of Muc Wa were a special breed of warrior, in that they were in the middle of the VC and NVA infilltration routes. Nights were routinely broken up into mortar rounds and enemy troop probes. Many nights we would arrive to find the VC in the wire and we had to place fire dead close, that is 25 meters. The VC and NVA were determined to take Muc Wa at any costs. And Saigon was determined to not let that happen. Only problem was, Saigon never bothered to supply them when they needed help. Between my fire teams of Viking Gunships, and Spooky, we lite up the night many times. The author described the fight for Muc Wa in chilling detail as the men fought a cat and mouse battle with the VC and NVA regulars. The compound was supported with Yards rangers who fought boldly with their American counterparts. I fly into Muc Wa one mission and was told to land at the CP. Asking where that was I was instructed it was the conex in the clearing! I was warmly welcomed with my load of ammo, food, water, and fuel. Never saw a bunch of guys more happy to see a chopper anytime! Always asked if we had room to take the wounded out and we always tried to help. Even at the best flight time we were still over30 minutes away and I always hoped they would still be there when I arrive on station! The author was able to show the daily lives of the troops at Muc Wa and how it went, day by day, always wondering what Charlie would do at sundown! Muc Wa was easy to find at night because it was the outpost with the flares over it!His details of the history of the area was true as I knew it.This small band of rag tag warriors were able to hold off the enemy battalion surrounding them, that had wiped out a French fighting force that had held the area before them.I highly recommend this book for the history of the area and the battle that was fought there. And yes, there really was a place called MucWa.Brian Reiss,1LT,121 Asslt. Helicopter Co., Viking Gunships.

A1BL2TCE749NB8	0	0	Ordered a 12 cell extended life battery for my HP Pavilion laptop that had a one year warranty. Battery lost over 80% of life in 10 months and after 6 emails to get warranty service, my one year expired! Point being, they don't honor their warranties and will not even reply to your emails! This company should be removed from Google for their shady dealings with warranty items. I had heard that the company was going out of business, but could not confirm, but after 6 emails, you would think they would answer just to get rid of me!So, Word to the wise! They look like they have great prices, but their warranty isn't worth a plug nickel when their battery dies. And their refusal to reply to emails shows they are a poor choice to do business with, unless you are looking for a cheap battery that will only last 6 months and has no warranty!I seldom slam a company unless they are taking advantage of people with lousy service and phony warranties! An this company seems to be at the top of the list at the moment!BUYERS BEWARE!! THEY WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY OR REPLY TO YOUR INQUIRIES!
A1BL2TCE749NB8	1	1	I had decided to replace the transmission filter in my XJ-6 Jaguar while I was rebuilding it and looked to Amazon for the part. I was surprised to locate a copy of the original part made in England. I ordered the part and it arrived quickly and was a perfect fit for my transmission and has been great so far. It is nice to know that I can turn to Amazon for parts like this for an older classic Jaguar from Amazon.

A1BL2TCE749NB8	0	0	I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE EXTREMELY DRY AND BORING. IT WAS NOTHING BUT A LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT ANY HINT OF PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE BY THE AUTHOR. MOST OF THESE FACTS COULD BE FOUND ON WIKIPEDIA OR SUCH. I SPENT THE ENTIRE TIME BETWEEN 68-69 WORKING WITH ASSAULT HELICOPTERS COMPANIES AS A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP COMMANDER AND WE NEVER SAW A "PATHFINDER" IN ANY LZ WE ASSAULTED. THE BOOK LACKED ANY PERSONAL COMBAT EXPERIENCES OF ANY SORT AND I COULD NOT EVEN STAND TO FINISH THE SAMPLE. IF YOU ARE INTO MATTER OF FACT STATEMENTS OF NOTHING BUT DRY FACTS THAT MANY OF THEM AREN'T EVEN TRUE.

A1BL96EA1SQ40P	1	1	I have this mill and it works really well. I use it to make pear and apple butter, tomato sauce, jellies, etc. It fits very well on plastic bowls without slipping and sliding much. Even my 3 year old can turn the handle!!However, if you are doing tons of sauces, etc. you will want a heavier duty one, or an electric.
A1BL96EA1SQ40P	1	1	I love this bra during the early days when you are HUGE and at night when you need a little pressure to keep from leaking (or to hold a pad in place), but want to be comfy too. And my husband LOVES it too!!
A1BL96EA1SQ40P	1	0	I picked this at random and was very pleased. It had lots of action and also a lot of realistic behavior from our hero (and some action that definitely stretched my imagination!).I read this in a day and was sad to see no more novels by this author.
A1BL96EA1SQ40P	1	1	We LOVE this CD at our house. My oldest is starting to get too old for the traditional kid music, so when we put this on, was he ever happy! It is rock and roll that is soo fun. I swear I pulled it out of my own cd player, except for the kid friendly lyrics.We listened to it for days and never got tired of it. We like it best turned up loud while on long car trips, the drive goes SOO much faster!!If you want traditional kids stuff, go for Phili Chickens or anything by Raffi. If you want music even parent's will love, give this one a try.
A1BL96EA1SQ40P	1	1	This is a great book. It is full of puns and humor that is perfect for young boys. I love to read it and my kids love hearing it. It is appropriate for about ages 4+ and is about a 3rd grade reading level. I am ordering the rest of the series.
A1BL96EA1SQ40P	0	0	My husband gave me this cookbook for Christmas a few years ago. I was very disappointed after looking at a few recipes and trying a couple others. These recipes don't work.I have been cooking and baking for many many years. Just looking at the recipes I knew the amounts were wrong (wrong rising agent for the amount of acid in the recipe, wrong porportion of liquid to dry ingredients, etc.), but I tried a couple anyhow. Total flop. The muffins were garbage and the cookies didn't taste good either.I can't figure out how so many people like this book. Pick any other standard cookbook before this one!
A1BLA8N8G790R0	0	0	I just finished slogging my way through this, and I am thoroughly disappointed in everything about it. The exposition was clumsy, the plot was nebulous, and at the end of the book, the story just stopped. It wasn't brought to a conclusion in a sensible way, no loose ends were wrapped up - instead, a couple of Shocking Revelations come forth that ask more questions than they answer.Setting aside concerns about the plot, this book would have been much, much better if the concepts had simply been handled competently; a decent Star Trek author could have taken these ingredients and written a spellbinding story with them. As it stands, though, the best thing about this book is the cover art. I find it hard to believe the sequel actually got published, and I'm glad I bought my copy of this book used. It is one of the few books I've purchased that will not remain in my collection; back to the used bookstore it goes.
A1BLA8N8G790R0	0	0	This movie is officially The Worst Thing Ever Filmed, and I am relieved to see that the manufacturer has discontinued it. If the statute of limitations didn't prevent it, I would suggest creating a petition to gather support for a class-action lawsuit against the creators of this audiovisual abomination.Some of the other reviewers compare this movie to Airplane! or the Naked Gun movies. Others claim that this is a satire, a spoof, or "so good it's bad." That's what I expected when I bought this movie, and unfortunately those reviewers are wrong. You may notice that Amazon's list of actors for this movie does NOT mention Leslie Nielsen, despite his presence being the reason for the name change from The Creature Wasn't Nice to Naked Space. There's a reason for this; I am convinced that the part of Leslie Nielsen in this movie was played by a disguised animatronic Al Gore-bot that had its comedy circuits removed with a ball-peen hammer.You see, there is a spectrum of awfulness when it comes to movies. When something is just a little below par, we can call it mediocre, and there are any number of examples; Batman and Robin will suffice here. Below that, it's simply bad, like perhaps the first Evil Dead. Below that, it's terrible; a random Children of the Corn sequel slots in right about here. Below that, we start to get into "so bad it's good" territory, as epitomized by movies like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Evil Dead 2, and (of course) The Rocky Horror Picture Show.The problem is, the spectrum doesn't stop there; the bad just keeps on coming. After "so bad it's good" we get to "so bad it's even worse" - such as House of the Dead, with its videogame frames. (Yes, the movie actually features quick shots from the video game it was licensed from. Complete with health bars.)If Batman and Robin is the ground floor and House of the Dead is the sub-subbasement, then The Creature Wasn't Nice is the septic tank under the shallow grave that was dug in the root cellar of that sub-subbasement. Yes, it's that bad.You see, this movie commits all the unforgivable sins of spoofs. First of all, it's not funny. I will grant that I laughed once at the sheer absurdity of "I Want to Eat Your Face," and that's what saves this movie from being under (or inside) the aforementioned septic tank. Second, the sex appeal that a spoof like this MUST have is practically nonexistent; the single scene of Cindy Williams (yes, "Shirley," as in "Laverne and") in a one-piece swimsuit simply does not qualify. Third, having Leslie Nielsen walk around repeating what someone else says is not a running gag. It's not even a gag. It's a waste of comic talent.Finally, there's the music. For music to work in a comedy, the one thing the songs cannot be is lackluster. Very good songs work, and very bad songs work, but forgettable songs are deadly. Whether you like Rocky Horror or despise it, you must admit that the songs are good. On the other hand, the catchiest song in this movie is the previously mentioned "I Want to Eat Your Face" - and that line is all I can remember of it.The only way this movie can reasonably be compared to Leslie Nielsen's other work is as one would compare a firebombed Yugo to a pristine Ferrari - yes, they're both automobiles, and both of them are subject to the laws of physics, but that's about it.If you want to see a funny movie with Leslie Nielsen and a spaceship, go watch Airplane II. On the other hand, if you want to break a prisoner who's proven resistant to all other forms of torture, make him watch this movie. If you really want to push the Geneva Conventions past the breaking point, make him watch it twice.
A1BLA8N8G790R0	1	0	...except that THIS movie ultimately made sense.This movie does start off as very disjointed and bizarre, and it seems like most of the reviewers here never got past that. Once the investigation starts, though, the pieces begin to come together and make sense, in exactly the way thatDonnie Darko - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)should have and never really did. The key difference is that Unholy is completely unconcerned with explaining how the weird stuff works (it's Nazi magic; deal with it and move on), while Darko falls apart unless you can somehow magically understand all of the weird rules that govern its peculiar version of time travel and alternate reality...and even then, you might want to hit Wikipedia and see if you got it right. Darko hangs a semblance of a plot on a poorly-explained idea; Unholy is a well-crafted mystery that doesn't fully make sense until you put the final pieces into place. (In other words, it's a well-crafted mystery.)Unholy gives you all the clues you need to understand it, but unless you were watching closely or jump right back in for a rewatch, you'll miss some. Yes, there are still a couple of holes that could have been (more explicitly) filled in, but they're side issues and you should be able to figure them out with a little thought. Just about every Weird Random Thing gets explained, either explicitly or by implication.It also helps tremendously if you listen to the three "radio broadcasts" that are played over the end credits; those are the final pieces of the puzzle, and playing them with the credits may have been a miscalculation, as many people will miss them. (Subtitles would have been VERY useful for this movie, for those and for Hope's taped journal. Both are sources of critical information, but they can be hard to hear clearly. If this gets a Blu-ray release, I hope subtitles will be part of the upgrade.) It also helps if you know enough history to understand the significance of the first two broadcasts, but if not, the last one (and the credit cookie at the very end) makes it Really Obvious what has happened.This is not a movie to turn on as background noise while you're doing something else and turn off when the first credits show up. If you do that, it'll make no sense and you'll think it's crap. This is a movie to focus on for an hour and a half, from the moment you hit "play" until the DVD comes back to the menu after the credits. All of the answers are in there, and everything really does come together in a coherent fashion. If you're confused after the first viewing, a second time should clear everything up nicely.Conclusion: If you're looking for mindless blood-and-guts horror, stay away from this one; you won't like it. If you like puzzle box plots (in the way that the best time travel stories are), pick it up, watch closely, and maybe watch it again.
A1BLA8N8G790R0	1	1	For the curious, here's the difference between the DVD soundtrack and the CD content: not much.The DVD is just over 92 minutes, starting with about 30 seconds of instrumental intro and ending with "Welcome to My Nightmare" playing over the credits. Neither of those tracks appears on the CD. In addition, "Only Women Bleed" and "I Never Cry" are two tracks on the CD, but one chapter on the DVD; this is why both discs list 27 tracks. (The "Nightmare" end credits are a 28th chapter, and could well be the album version.) Other than that, the differences seem to be just little cuts to tighten up the show so it'll fit on a CD - 30 seconds here, a minute there, cutting out some of the incidental audio that goes with the more visual "acting" parts of the show. I haven't done an in-depth comparison yet, but that seems to be the case from looking at chapter and track times.The inclusion of the CD booklet was a nice touch, and I found myself wishing I'd bought this in the "CD with bonus DVD" packaging instead of vice versa. That way, I could've put my Montreux 2005 and Hammersmith 2009 DVDs together in the Montreux case and the CDs together in this jewel case. Live and learn, though. I really would've preferred that the full DVD audio had been put onto the DVD as high bitrate MP3s, truth be told - that way, one disc would do everything.Don't let the format nitpicks dissuade you, though - this is a wild show and a worthy addition to your collection, in any of the three formats.
A1BLAY0PF14M88	1	1	Let me start by saying that nu-metal is here to stay. If you don't like it, go listen to something else, that is why there is so many genres of music. Now back to the important topic which is Trapt and their new album Someone in Control. The album to me is a very good mix of hard rock with great melody. I'll break down each song as followed:1. Disconnected-(9/10) This is a great opening song, sets a pace2. Waiting-(8/10) Catchy riff, ok song3. Victim-(10/10) You can almost feel his pain through his voice.4. Stand Up-(9/10) Single, great energy5. Repeat Offender-(7/10) My least fav, but not bad6. Lost Realist-(11/10) Great Vibe, best song on the CD7. Skin Deep-(9/10) Great Guitar work, good song8. Influence-(9/10) Tempo changes back and forth, works well9. Bleed like me-(10/10) Great lyrics, can relate10. Use me to use you-(9/10) Little bit on the harder side11. My Own Design-(10/10) Solo at the end did it for meOverall, I feel this cd matches up, or even possibly surpasses their previous release. One thing is for sure, these guys are here to stay and I hope to see them in concert real soon!
A1BLAY0PF14M88	1	1	Now unlike that other guy, who just wanted to be 1st on the list, I actually have something to say about this Nickelback album. I have been waiting for what seems like forever for this to come out. When I first heard "Photograph" on my satelite radio, I was searching for the release date and have been waiting ever since. Well now the time has come and boy have they produced. With such great cds being released lately, I definately have to put this one up their with the likes of Trapt, Staind, and Disturbed. I like to consider myself someone who listens to all types of rock or alternative music. I believe Nickelback does a great job balancing their sound, although many people have said that they have gone a little more on the soft side. Needless to say here's how the whole cd breaks down through my eyes:1: Follow you home(9/10)- A great opening song with great lyrics2: Fight for all the Wrong Reasons(9.5/10)- Great Chorus, once again Chad's vocals are one of the best in the business3: Photograph(9/10)- Chad does a great job painting "pictures" for his listening audience4: Animals(10/10)- More fast pace, great energy and lyrics5: Savin' Me(9.5/10)- On the slower side, awesome mood set by the guitar work and his vocals.6: Far Away(9/10)- Those who like Nickelback for their slower songs, you will love this song, kinda sad.7: Next Contestant(11/10)- This song is just great. I can relate and I'm sure anyone with a girlfriend who gets hit on alot can. I love the energy in this song.8: Side of a Bullet(8.5/10)- There's always that one song where you think, "Not bad, but not as good as the rest", this one is that song. Although, I will say during the solo in the middle of the song, Ryan played something that sounded very similar to classic Metallica, thought that was kind of cool.9: If Everyone Cared(10/10)- Out of the slower songs on the cd, this is my favorite, has a great message.10: Someone that you're with(10/10)- I really love the guitar riff in this song, has a very uptempo feel.11: Rockstar(9/10)- Yet again, not a bad song. Lyrics are kinda funny. However, I wish they would end with a more fast pace song, but overall not a bad song.Overall, I gave this album 5 stars because it really does deserve it. I'm even going to go out on a limb and say it's the best album so far of 2005. If you liked past Nickelback albums, get this one. You won't be dissappointed. And if you've never really listened to nickelback(where have you been), get this album and get acclaimated with them because you'll soon be converted in to a fan.
A1BLAY0PF14M88	1	1	Let me start off by saying how I hate everyone bashing the Seasons album. To be perfectly honest, that was the first album I ever owned of Sevendust and found myself being able to go through that entire album without skipping a song. Since then I've gotten the rest of their albums and loved most of their work. Fast forward to the present with their release of Next. I'll be the first to admit, I was a little sketchy with Clint leaving the band. But I now realized that the true leader of this band is Lagon. The man can simply sing and/or scream with melody. This is what I love the most about the band. I like rocking out just as much as the next guy, but I also like to be able to understand what he is actually saying. Enough with the ranting, here's how the songs break down:1-Hero-(9.5/10)-What a great song to start off with. The energy in this song is amazing, would love to see this song live.2-Ugly-(9.5/10)-They let up a little on the gas pedal, but show the melody that they can produce.3-Pieces-(9/10)-Alot of people believe this is one of their better songs, I feel that while it's good, I've heard better from the band.4-Silence-(10.5/10)-Absolutely, hands down, the "BEST" song on this album. I find myself listening to this song over and over, and over again.5-This Life-(9.5/10)-Mellow, great lyrics, shows why Sevendust is so versatile.6-Failure-(10/10)-Great chorus, love the power riffs.7-See and Believe(10/10)-The only reason this song isn't the best on the album was that I felt the chorus was to repitative. Otherwise, the lyrics and the guitarwork is amazing.8-Shadows in Red-(9/10)-Another milder song. Not a horrible song, but not as good as the rest. Lyrics are good.9-The Last Song-(8.5/10)-I felt this song was put together horribly, maybe it's just the lack of melody. They seem to produce alot of energy, would be a good mosh pit song live.10-Desertion-(10/10)-Great example of why I love Sevendust, energy+melody+great lyrics = great song!11-Never-(9.5/10)-Great finisher, awesome chorus.There's two things I wish would have happened with this album. First, it would be longer(It seems every Sevendust album I find myself wanting more). And sdcond, that it would take less than every two years for a new album. But that is why every cd is great, they make sure they take the time to make it a masterpiece. I can't wait for these guys to come to FL so I can see them in concert!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I've read a lot of the reviews of this book - some very positive and some very negative, and I've read the book myself.One thing that you have to consider is that this book is based on the opinion of the subject - Ric Flair. Whether it's right or wrong, it's his opinion.I grew up with wrestling, and I remember all the old school wrestlers like Bullet Bob Armstrong, Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, Andre the Giant, Sting, and many others. And, whether you like to admit it or not, Ric Flair has a legitimate claim as one of those legends.Ric's legacy in the wrestling industry is fortunately much greater than his legacy as a father and a role model. He seems to be bitter about the changes in the wrestling industry, and is having a hard time adjusting (personally, I don't like the direction wrestling is going now either). The cheap shots at other wrestlers are distasteful.All in all, this is a good book, especially for those who remember wrestling in the early 80s and beyond.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	I tolerated Odd Thomas, and I made it through that book. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for By the Light of the Moon.Someone gave this book to me for Christmas; otherwise I wouldn't have even picked it up. I attempted to read it, and was completely bored. Fact it - it's dull.There are a lot of Dean Koontz fans out there, but I am not one of them. I won't be making the mistake of reading another one.If I could have given this book 0 stars, I would have done that.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	God has plans for you - that is the recurrent theme of Against All Odds. And Chuck Norris demonstrates this by the way he lives his life.After reading the biography of another sports entertainment legend (Ric Flair), it was refreshing to see someone like Chuck Norris who I would gladly let a young person view as a role model. It would be an honor for a young person to try to emulate the behavior of Mr. Norris.It was interesting to see his humble beginnings, and his determination to succeed, all the while keeping his true priorities in line.Chuck Norris is the real deal, someone who is gracious and generous (see all his work with Make a Wish); the way a celebrity who has been blessed with so much ought to be.Thank you, Chuck, for redeeming my belief that one can be materially successful and still be a good (Christian) person.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	Unlike other reviewers, I expect to be entertained when I see a movie. Whether I rent the movie or see it in the theater, I am paying my money to see the movie. I don't intend on wasting my money on a movie that I approach with low expectations.I rented The Grudge thinking that it was a good caliber horror movie. It stunk. The movie is poorly made and is not scary.Compared to another similar movie, The Ring, this movie is not even in the same ballpark. Don't waste your money or time with this let down of a movie.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	You can tell that the author is getting more comfortable in his writing style with Life Everlasting. Where Life Support was a very good but often not fluid work, the story of Life Everlasting wound its' way around intricate characters and a complex setting.One would probably need to have read Life Support to appreciate the plot and some of the references in Life Everlasting, but it could be enjoyed on its' own.Life Everlasting is a great book, and I am looking forward to more from Whitlow.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I can easily say that Homer Hickam is my favorite author. I was hooked when I read The Rocket Boys (October Sky) and Sky of Stone. Every book Mr. Hickam has written has been just as good as or better than the previous book, which is VERY high praise. Hickam manages to spin creative tales with interesting characters and interesting plot lines, time after time.Some authors, after a little success, begin to get predictable, or they begin to lose their creative edge. Not so with Homer Hickam! In my opinion, there are two authors that consistently produce outstanding works - the great John Grisham and Homer Hickam. I can only hope that Mr. Hickam's career as an author turns out to include as many books as John Grisham has produced.This is a wonderful, epic tale of World War II life, and, even for younger readers like myself, born two decades after World War II, we can almost feel like we knew what it was like to be there. I mean no disrespect to the honorable World War II veterans (and all other veterans) out there - I truly appreciate your service and I thank you for all that you did.For a good, entertaining read, RUN OUT AND BUY THE AMBASSADOR'S SON! You WILL NOT be disappointed!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	....Darth Sidious laid a pale hand on Anakin's brow. "Then it is done. You are now one with the Order of the Dark Lords of the Sith. From this day forward, the truth of you, my apprentice, now and forevermore, will be Darth..."A pause; a questioning in the Force-An answer, dark as the gap between galaxies-He heard Sidious say it: his new name.Vader.We all knew WHAT would happen. We just didn't know HOW it would happen. Matthew Stover has vividly brought to life the epic bridge between the "old" and the "new".Do you feel sorry for Anakin? Can you almost feel how much he loves Padme', and how much he will do, what he will surrender, to keep her love? Do you almost see the progression of daring young Jedi knight in love to skeptical, egotistical madman?Do you feel the sorrow of Obi Wan, realizing that his Padawan, his lifelong friend, has allowed emotion to cloud his judgement?Do you feel the limitless love of Padme' for her prince, and how she yearns to be with the one she loves?Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover is a MUST read for the true Star Wars fan. It is skillfully written, a real page turner.Run out and get this one - you won't be disappointed!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	1	I respect all of you who have rated this book so highly, but I just don't see it. I live a short drive across Mobile Bay from the center of the action of The Poet of Tolstoy Park, and I certainly would like to say that I enjoyed the book. I bought this book to support a local author and hopefully enjoy a good, highly recommended book.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Usually, I can tell within about three pages whether or not I will like a book. With this one, it took about three paragraphs to know that this book just isn't my style.I'm sure it's a great book for people who enjoy that sort of book, but it did nothing for me.Please don't take my review only - the trends for The Poet of Tolstoy Park certainly are promising, and I hope Sonny Brewer does well. I did like the foreword from the author, but I did not enjoy the book.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	I was very impressed with Driven, and I anxiously got Takedown, with high hopes. While this book was fairly good, it just lacked depth. The plot was somewhat predictable, there was no cliffhanger type moment, the character development was weak, and the ending was flat.I was disappointed, to say the least.This book didn't take long to read at all, it is very simply written and does not have much substance. It's not bad; I've read worse, but it could have been much better.I doubt I will remember anything about this book in two weeks.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	This is another very good book by now veteran author Mike Stewart. Mr. Stewart has moved (somewhat) from his familiar book settings, and puts the action of A Perfect Life in a different part of the country.The plot is, as usual, intriguing, with enough suspense to keep you going through the end. The characters are well thought out and fit together.I think this is a very good book, but I just don't see it being quite worthy of the 5 star absolute best rating. However, you will definitely enjoy reading A Perfect Life by a consistently good author, Mike Stewart.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I stumbled across William Lashner through some Amazon.com reviews and found his books at my local library - boy am I glad I did!Falls the Shadow is a wonderfully entertaining novel that will keep you interested throughout the book. The lead character is a money hungry, cynical, wisecracking barrister who you will really enjoy getting to know. An unlikely chess playing sidekick turns up, who is equally cynical and quick with a put-down.All in all, this is a great suspense legal thriller type book, and you will certainly be glad you picked this one up.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	This book seems like the movie The Punisher, at first. But the more you delve into the book, the more mysterious it becomes. I don't want to give a full synopsis of the book and the plot; you can read that for yourself on the description section.Instead, I'll tell you why I liked this book.- It seemed familiar, yet unique; reminiscent of The Punisher movie, yet totally new- It was brilliantly written, with enough suspense to keep you interested from cover to cover- It was creepy, sort of like the aftermath of a car wreck that you don't want to see, yet you're curious about- It was long enough to be a good value, but not too long so as to be boringIf you liked books like Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris, you'll love this one.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I got this book after reading several of the reviews, and I was definitely not disappointed. I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons (by Dan Brown), and Map of Bones is along the same theme as these two.I never lost interest in this book, I thought the plot was outstanding, and the twists were enough to keep you on your toes.Great book!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	Joe Finder has written another fascinating book in "Company Man".One thing I find slightly amusing about Mr. Finder is his background in intelligence vs his writing about corporate life. Interesting.On to the book.Company Man is a brilliant page-turner about a small-town company CEO who finds himself in the middle of forced job cuts due to the company's acquisition, the loss of his wife in a very little mentioned car accident, and a stalker.How Nick Conover, the CEO, evolves and deals with all the situations surrounding him, as well as all the twists of fate, will keep you interested and keep you guessing!Enjoy this wonderful work by Joe Finder!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I just recently discovered the Harry Potter series. This is a great book, fun to read for adults and kids.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I've just gotten into the Harry Potter series, and I absolutely love it! Great books!

A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	Order of the Phoenix is a great book, Harry and the other characters are growing older and facing more complex problems. I loved it!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	Bewitched is a boring and corny remake of a great tv show. Not worth taking the time to watch.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	I've rarely seen a movie that was better than, nor even close to, as good as the book. And this is no exception. Many of the reviewers here have noted the discrepancies between the movie and Dan Brown's book, namely the overall lack of codes and investigation of Da Vinci. I loved the book, but hated the movie.Take the advice of the reviewers who have read the book, and don't waste your money. I promise you, if you liked the book, you'll leave this movie scratching your head and wondering why you did it.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	This is a great way to delve into why you're having cold calling reluctance, and a source for dealing with your issues head-on. I am SO glad I bought this book, and worked with the author, Shawn Greene.Sometimes I say I give a book one star because I can't give it zero stars. With "I'd Rather Have a Root Canal Than Do Cold Calling", I only gave it Five Stars because I can't give it an even higher rating.This is the real deal!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	Jimmy is all about the characters. You won't find a lot of bone chilling drama or mystery here. What you'll find is a wholesome story about a boy who sees the world a bit different than you and I. I was very pleased with this book, and I would highly recommend it.I have two things where I think the book felt flat, however. First, the book is touted about a boy who sees angels. Angels (who Jimmy calls "Watchers") do appear in the book in various places, but I don't think the theme was developed as well as it could have. These "Watchers" could have been expanded upon to play a larger role in the book. Second, I think the ending is a let-down. The alternate ending on the website is a bit better than the "official" ending, but I still don't think either one tie up the loose ends of the book.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jimmy, and I would gladly tell anyone I know to buy this book.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	0	0	Help! Let me out of the House!! No, not because it's such a scary masterpiece. But because it is boring, poorly developed, and extremely lacking in character depth and development.Which one is Jack? Which one is Susan? Who cares?I never connected with any of the characters, and I was glad to get through this book. Truth be told, I skimmed the last three or four chapters just to be able to "finish" the book. I was largely disappointed in what could have been a very good book.And, the Christian theme was rather poorly developed, as was the whole of the book. I say jeers to Peretti and Dekker on this let-down of a corroboration.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	Joseph Finder seems to get better and better as he writes. Killer Instinct is another great book by a brilliant and entertaining author. Killer Instinct gives you a glimpse into the life of a cynical salesman in a worldwide electronics company. His ambition and success skyrocket as Kurt Semko enters, and Jason Steadman, like most of us would, gets sucked in.What follows is a whirlwind tale reminscient of the 1980s hit movie Wall Street. The corporate jargon and sales life are right on, and the book flys by. WONDERFUL job.
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I read The Lincoln Lawyer by Michael Connelly based on the recommendations of users here at amazon.com. Let me say, I was utterly pleased!! This is a great book, easy and fun to read, which keeps you guessing!!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I am a Navy vet, but NOT a Navy SEAL. I am fascinated with the BUD/S training, and very much enjoy reading accounts of BUD/S. Suffer In Silence seems to be the most realistic portrayal of the reality of BUD/S. I enjoyed this book very much, and I am glad that I bought this one!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I quite enjoyed reading Got the Look, by James Grippando. One day several years ago, I picked up one of Grippando's books while browsing for a James Grisham book in my local library. Some of his titles looked intriguing, and the book synopses looked like something I'd enjoy. And I've been a huge James Grippando fan ever since! I am so glad my eyes strayed from the John Grisham row that day!True to form, Got the Look is a masterpiece, bringing together witty dialogue, great imagery, and a mysterious plot.Read it - you won't be disappointed!
A1BLG3FKJPLSTL	1	1	I attended a lecture by Fred Lee, where he discussed some of the points brought up in his 9 1/2 Things book, and I was very impressed. First of all, I am a huge Disney fan, and I know that the Disney method transcends the typical service model, and focuses on the entire process as an "experience".Mr. Lee, in this very insightful book, delves into how this can be applied to healthcare. And why should it not be applied to healthcare? In healthcare, there is a tremendous opportunity for caring and competent people to turn a frightening and intrusive process into an experience.Sure, going to the hospital will never be a fun trip like a trip to Disney would be, but it can be one that is memorable for the RIGHT reasons rather than memorable for the WRONG reasons.There are so many pieces of valuable information in this book that you'll need to keep it readily available as a reference tool.
A1BLMF9FDG44EI	1	1	This is the first book that I have read from this author. It was overall a good read but it did at times get repeditive.
A1BLTGHXBIBWEO	1	1	I bought the other VW Trends Beetle restoration book and returned it. Very disappointing. This one, on the other hand, is terrific!I have a '73 Super Beetle and plan to use this book to guide me through several projects I am planning.When I saw the first article used in the book in a VW Trends magazine on the news stand I tried to get a subscription beginning with that issue because, if I remember correctly, they wanted about $10 for a back issue!!! I called to see about getting a subscription starting with the news stand issue and got the runaround about not being able to choose the first issue of a subscription. So I emailed them. After more than six weeks I finally received a reply. By then I was so pi**ed off I blew them off.When I saw the book come out I looked it over and was very pleased because it would have cost a small fortune to get the back issues of the magazine with the same articles.Anyway, even though I haven't used the book for an actual restoration yet, from the reading I've done it appears that the author has done an excellent job of documenting the steps he went through while restoring his own VW Super Beetle.
A1BLTGHXBIBWEO	1	1	Great book! I'm going to read it again. There is much to be learned from ole triple-L.More modern books are the ones I depend upon for day-to-day use. Also, I'd recommend The Hive and the Honey Bee from Dadant for a more up to date and much thicker book.The only complaints I have are for Dover. The price is too high. The print is fairly small in the main portion of the text but it's extremely small in the footnotes. Since some of the footnotes are very long this is a real problem. Also, it must have been printed from photographic copies instead of typeset. Many of the letters of the alphabet are chopped off and it sometimes takes a bit to understand what word was intended.As far as content I give it 5 stars but for quality of printing it gets 3 stars. Average that out to 4 stars.
A1BLTGHXBIBWEO	0	0	If you don't tell me which size this is how do I know if it will fit my gun?Is this a size 3?Is the Bianchi part number for this holster 15254?This model Bianchi Black Widow Model 5 holster can fit any number of guns depending upon which size it is.I can't buy it if you don't give me enough information...
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	As the title of the review says this is one movie that, to me, is actually better than the book. Having read the book twice, I felt the story was great, the characters were perfect but there was just too much philosophical rambling in it that took away from my enjoyment of the story. The movie has removed all that extra rambling and concentrates solely on the two main storylines of Paloma and Renee. It works out the difficulty of Paloma writing in her diary by having her keep a video diary instead, which works well for the movie.The casting was perfect for all the characters although some of the books main characters were completely missing from the movie.The ending kept true to the book and made me gasp despite knowing what was going to happen. The movie maker did not try to glamorise it which would have ruined the point of the story for me.Even if you have not read the book it is a worthwhile movie to watch. I watched it with a friend who had not read the book and she loved it and was in tears at the end of it. I was worried that she would struggle to follow the storylines having not read the detail in the book but apart from one minor point, she seemed to "get" it.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	0	0	Ok clearly I was missing something. I gave up on page 101 because I just could not be bothered reading on. It is not like me to give up on such a short novel but this was grating on my every nerve.I hated the Southern American Negro vernacular that was used from the start. The grammatical errors of this speech just annoyed me. Ok,ok, I know that is probably how the characters talked in real life back then but I struggled to follow it. I also thought the writing style (other than the type of speech used) was rather self righteous and long winded. Even 101 pages in, the author had not really made a point, or at least not one that I noticed.If this is the "most important novel written about the American Negro" then I really need someone to sit down and explain why. Surely, To Kill a Mockingbird would be more important or Gone with the wind, or many other such novels. Luckily, this is a book group choice and I will, partially, get the chance to find out why when we sit down and discuss it.Sorry to all the diehard fans out there but I just did not get it.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	Published in 1967, it is slightly dated but this almost adds to it's charm.The story is simple with the moral that everything is useful and has a place in the world.The ending annoyed me a little bit and I will quote the last page."And Billy was right. A few days later, out of the egg sac came lots of little spiders.From then on, Helen and her children and all the animals in the Zoo lived happily ever after"Anyone who has read Charlotte's Web will know that once Helen has that little egg sac she is not long for this world! Ok, I know, my daughter is only two but I don't believe in always teaching her happily ever after, what is wrong with a bit of realism.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	Great quality toy. Very well made and the quality of the material is superb. No educational value whatsoever but my daughter loves it and Ernie (with Bert, of course) has to go everywhere now.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	0	0	Well I guess I am not the target audience being a 40 something Mother and not a youngish geeky man. I think you would like this movie if you like the comics but otherwise, it just seemed so pointless.I was also very annoyed by The Hulk. To start he could not control his anger (just like in the tv series of the same name) and was a danger to others but then suddenly, he could control it and use it as he wanted to while working with others! I either missed something or this is a bad continuity error in the story.Not a fan.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	The story is well known and, therefore, predictable but there is some great acting from Charlize Theron in this movie as well as fantastic cinematography. This movie proves once again what a great actress Charlize Theron actually is and Kristen Stewart should take note from her. Kristen Stewart is cast as Snow White and, in and of itself, this would make good casting but you just cannot forget that she is currently playing Bella in the Twilight saga which comes across as much the same role and acting as this one. The moody looks, the love triangle, a lot of nighttime shooting, yes that can describe both this movie and Twilight. It would have been better to cast someone else at this time.The dwarves were hilarious and a number of British faces that I recognised from other favourite movies. So funny see their faces on little dwarf bodies - Ray Winstone as a dwarf anyone - laugh out loud. I did have some tears for the dwarves as well at one point but won't say why as it would be a spoiler.In the extended there is some quite graphic scenes that made my stomach heave slightly. I assume these are not in the regular version, so if you are at all squeamish, don't watch the extended version.Well done movie for the subject matter but dropped a star for the casting of Snow White.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	This is not a movie masterpiece, it is a Will Ferrell movie so anyone expecting more than a hilarious movie will be disappointed. I watched this the weekend before the US elections and it was the perfect timing to get all the subtle and not so subtle jokes. The spin, the makeovers, the voting machines produced by the candidates son! My husband is not a fan of Will Ferrell but he laughed out loud throughout this movie and declared it a hit.It was slightly worrying for real life though as a lot of what they were joking about seems to be happening in real life politics as well.A good, light hearted, funny movie. Not award winning so if you are a movie snob/buff then don't bother but if you want to pass an evening with some laughter then give it a try.and, no, I still do not understand the American political system!
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	This book was chosen as one of my book group reads and I must admit about groaning before starting it and going into it with a biased view. I do not like Clint Eastwood movies and associated this book with a Clint Eastwood movie (even though I haven't even watched it) so I thought it would be everything I hated about an old fashioned, bodice swelling love story.I could not have been more off the ball on this. I could not help compare the book to the classic book, Love Story by Erich Segal as it was set over a short period, it was pithy and to the point. I thought the writing style was just divine as it flowed like a chocolate fountain and was so descriptive that I could picture each location as if I were there myself. I am so glad he kept it short and to the point as it did not allow all the unnecessary sloppiness that is usually inserted in these types of novels and it kept it true to the short time period (a few days) that the love element actually happened.I have a confession! I actually shed a tear and felt my heart breaking for the two main characters as I so wanted a happy outcome for them, even many years later. I usually hate happy endings but this is one book that I wanted to have one. I wasn't actually disappointed though that it didn't have a happy ending as the actual ending was just true to the overall story. Sorry can't say more as do not want to insert a spoiler.So, a pleasant surprise from my original bias and a movie I now want to watch. I guess I will try and get the book group together after the discussion to watch it. 5 out of 5 from me and if it can make a cynic like me cry then everyone else will be weeping buckets of tears!
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	0	These live on our fridge door and my 2 year old loves to run from the family room when you tell her to go get a certain letter. she then picks it off the fridge - upper and lower case - and runs gleefully back to me. A really easy and fun way to continue teaching the letters while sitting down with a cup of tea for 10 minutes. I have dropped one star as my set does not have a capital D but instead has two lower case d's. I could have returned it when I bought it, of course but I didn't inform the supplier as I didn't notice until we had opened and used them for a couple of days. Not a big deal and I won't criticise the supplier as I never gave them the option to correct the mistake or not.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	These live on our fridge door and quite frequently I will find my 2 year old sitting in front of the fridge just going through her numbers. A great distraction when one is trying to cook the family dinner. I originally put them out when she was just over one year old but that was too early as she chewed on them (and she is not generally a chewer) so I put them away. No problems when I reintroduced them at about 18 months old.An easy way to continue teaching in a fun way while still getting on with other chores.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	This movie is a classic example of a low budget, lesser known movie just getting it right. It hits hard and is such a powerful story that you are just sucked into it despite it lacking the dramatic effects of the blockbuster movies of today. Paddy Considine gets the role just right and Toby Kebbell is amazing as his mentally challenged brother.The Big Twist - I did not see that coming - and you have to watch the movie all over again afterwards to get a whole new appreciation of it. No more said as I don't want to ruin it for you.The one downside for some people will be the accents. Very strong English Midlands accents are hard to follow at times (and I am Scottish) but do not let it put you off this movie as it is well worth struggling through the dialogue.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	If you are a lover of independent, low budget movies, like me, then you will love this one. It is billed as a black comedy but some people seem to mistake this for a comedy. It is not Shaun of the Dead, it is a fairly serious movie with some underlying humour throughout. It's main message is quite sad with underage boys having to fend for themselves because they have been forgotten and abandoned by their families. The lead male has the attitude of a much older man despite being only a boy but he has not had an easy life and has had to fend for himself for most of his life. You can almost understand how he got into crime and being a young thug and can even empathise with him.The aliens are hilarious and look like evil Furbies but I guess this is because of the low budget. Don't let the bad aliens ruin the movie though as the story is not changed. In fact, I don't think this movie would have worked so well had it been shot with a bigger budget.I am from Britain and have spent a lot of time working in and around London but even I struggled to understand the broad London accents at times. However, the accents added to my enjoyment of the movie as it gave it an element of reality but I think your average American watcher will struggle to understand them. Don't let that put you off as it is a movie worth watching.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	Another book group choice that I openly groaned about at first. I have only read one other of this authors books, "Of Mice and Men", and while I loved that book (and the film) I thought that this book would be a painful struggle to get through.I was right about it being a struggle to read and almost gave up at page 105. However, I am glad that I kept on reading to the end. It is a book that has many different facets to it and will make a thoroughly interesting discussion for a book group.The story is a hard one to read because it is just still too real in today's society, where there is enough for everyone but the rich would rather destroy it than distribute it to the needy. Now I am not a Socialist by any description but this book certainly did make me think strong and hard about it. I am looking forward to discussing this aspect of the book with my Russian friend who was brought up in the most extreme end of the socialist scale in Russia.The writing style was varied throughout the book. Some parts of it were very descriptive and emotional and really drew me into the feelings of the characters while there were whole chapters that I thought were just too wordy and did not add significantly to the book as a whole. I, initially, struggled with the vernacular of the migrants on the road but eventually got used to their way of speaking and, in fact, it made it feel more real to me and put me beside them in their lives.The ending was intense and somewhat shocking to me but it did give me back some hope in the goodness of humans that had been stripped from me by the rest of the book.4 out of 5 with one star deducted because it was a struggle and could not be described as an enjoyable read and would not be for everyone. I would suggest starting with "Of Mice and Men" if you have not read any of this authors works before as I think this book would put you off reading any of his other books. However, put it on your list of books to read before you die.Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person! And that is my closing thought.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	The unrated version is definitely very risque. A simple, funny movie concept that is just done right. Seth MacFarlane is a comedy genius and with the acting skills of Mark Wahlberg and his ability to completely take the piss out of himself, this movie is laugh out loud funny. Very rude in places and nothing beats the fight scene between Ted and Marky Mark. A must watch for adults.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	A book group pick and not one I would have picked up on my own steam. However, it was a quite enjoyable read. I would liken it to a wordy Elin Hilderbrand, the same type of beach setting, mixed characters, one gritty storyline but a lot of fun going on within the book.It is no classic but a book that would be a good holiday/beach read. It was a bit too wordy in places and I felt that a good 100 to 150 could have been edited out of the book without changing the story in the slightest. Some parts I happily speed read through without losing anything from the book or story. I also felt that there was just one too many side storylines in it. The main story of Lovie and her relationship with Caretta, her daughter, was strong enough without having to have several main side stories as well.I was very interested in the facts about the loggerhead turtles that started each chapter and this was a nice touch to focus your mind on the main story.Not a bad read, just not my cup of tea generally. Not sure how good a book group discussion it will make as the storylines were quite plain without any hidden depth to discuss, in my opinion. 4 out of 5 for am entertaining read if this is your chosen genre.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	0	After all the hype surrounding her novel, Me before you, I thought I would read this book that has been on my bookshelves for an unknown amount of time. It just never jumped out at me before so I thought I would dive right on in.It started quite slowly and I was wondering where is was going to go. The style started off feeling a bit strange to me but it all started to make sense about a third of the way into the book once all the threads of the characters started coming together.I must admit to guessing what the secrets were before they were revealed but this did not ruin the story for me as I liked the way the author wrote them into the story. While being predictable the author made them interesting by revealing them in different and fairly unique ways.I usually hate happy endings but I was thrilled by one aspect of the ending of this book - don't worry I won't give it away.A great introduction to a new author to me and one that means I will definitely go on to try out some of her other books. 4 out of 5 for me, with one star being dropped as I felt it was about 75 to 100 pages too long, in my opinion but worth a read.
A1BMET3MONQ1WE	1	1	One of my main criticisms when I am reading and reviewing books is that sometimes I struggle with a particular vernacular. If it is written with a heavy Southern or Negro vernacular then I find it hard to get into the story and I am often tempted to give up as I am not enjoying the book. See my review on Go Tell it on the mountain by James Baldwin if you need an example.So, it was with this in mind that I chose this book as this months read for one of my book groups. I wanted the others to get some sort of understanding of what I mean when I say I struggle with certain American dialects.Written entirely in my birth dialect of Glaswegian it does take a couple of chapters, even for me to get into the rhythm of this book. It must have been an extremely hard book to write doing so entirely in Glaswegian without even any descriptive paragraphs in plain English. I am quite impressed with the authors ability to do this as it would have been quite easy to just keep the conversations in Glaswegian while putting descriptive paragraphs in simpler terms.The story itself is not a classic but it does have some depth and meaning below the surface, although some of that may be lost with people struggling to understand the language. I felt quite sad for the characters in the end. Although there was an element of happiness, I just thought that they would never be quite the same again and that there would always be a sadness in their minds for various reasons (trying not to give away a spoiler).One criticism is that, despite the title, I thought it did not go into Buddhism enough or indeed Jimmy's journey in and out of it. I felt that the whole side story with Anne Marie and Nisha and the CD was unnecessary and I would have liked more about Jimmy himself. I know that the point of the whole Anne Marie story, was probably to show how for a 12 year old, life just goes on no matter what is happening with her parents and that she is, blissfully, unaware of all the drama that Jimmy and Liz is going through. Credit to her parents for shielding her from it all though.A good read to help me prove a point to my book group and one that does make one think but it is no classic or must read for everyone. 4 out of 5.To end I want to write out a Scottish toast that you should give before eating or drinking:Here's Tae Us; Wha's Like Us?.........Damn Fewand they're a' deid!
A1BMK64JNZZCI2	1	1	Desire make me feel like prrrring. Geri did a really good job with this song. I loved Ride IT! but Desire! is even better. Check it out I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
A1BMK64JNZZCI2	1	1	I love this album, I wasn't sure about buying it at first so I bought the Desire single first with the remixes and I enjoyed it.My favorite songs on the album are Desire, Ride It, Love Never Loved me, Surrender Your Groove, and Don't Get Any Better. I played the album over a BBQ I was having and received a great repsonse from my guests; some of them couldn't beleive that it was Geri. I hope everyone enjoyes this album as much as I do.
A1BMK64JNZZCI2	0	1	I had this router for a few months and it gave me problems right from the start. I thought at first it might be my computers, but soon realized that it was the dlink router. Upon further investigation I found out that dlink uses cheap parts in their routers and they often burn out.I'm now using a an AirPort Extreme Base Station from Apple and I couldn't be happier.I wish you the best of luck if you decide to go with any dlink routers.
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	0	0	For the first few weeks or so of using this product, I was really pleased with the results. After a while, it left so much build-up on everything I used... My flat iron had a disgusting brown film around the edges and even my hair started feeling dirty... I would only use a dime sized amount and I have long hair. Even washing my hair a few times wouldn't get it as clean as it should have been. Needless to say, I've stopped using this product.
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	1	1	My kitty loves sleeping in her famous Superman position. I had been searching for a bed to accommodate her long, stretched out self and this was a great choice! She can sprawl out all she wants and still has a little room left over. :-)
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	1	1	I have always loved Pyrex sets. They are made well and do not retain food smells. This is actually my second set like this because I use them so often!
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	1	1	This book is definitely a must buy. It helped me get through a really tough time in my life and it has been passed on to friends. Stormie is such an inspiration!
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	1	1	I was very pleased with this product when it came in. It is made well and has a generous amount of room for my cat. As soon as I unfolded it, she got right into it. I've had it for about a month and she still uses it as her nap hot-spot! She outgrew her other pet carrier but this would be able to comfortably transport even the heftiest cats. :-)
A1BMNDXDWBFUI1	1	1	Very well made! It stays in place and it surprisingly heavy! It is by far the best exercise mat I've ever used.
A1BMYIK17F3V5G	1	1	I just finished Myst 3: Exile and I'm still in a trance. Several aspects of this game are extremely brilliant and combine to make this one of my favorite experiences sitting at a computer:1) The music. The Myst 3 soundtrack contains echoes of motifs from Myst and Riven. As with its predecessors, the evocative instrumental music accompanies your exploration of each Age, working sneakily on your emotions to pull you into an appropriately reflective mood. But in this case, it's not just one song to an area (which tends to get annoying after a couple repetitions) -- it's an ever-changing score that incorporates elements of interactivity, mirroring your progress in each Age on a micro level. Composer Jack Wall and audio programmer Roland Gustaffsson have finally solved the age old Myst problem of repetitiveness over rather long stretches of gameplay. Wall basically sliced each Age's theme into instrumental layers/motifs (pads, rhythm, melodic fragments, etc), stored each of these layers as a separate sound file, and then Gustaffsson programmed in a complex set of rules to tell those files when and how to play back -- separately or in simultaneity -- based on where you are in the game, what puzzles you've solved, etc. The result is a nonlinear sound score with a finite number of motifs but an infinite number of possible variations. In other words, even if you spend days playing, you're not likely to hear the same sequence twice. Maybe all you non-music-geeks out there are wondering what's so exciting about this, but I'm just amazed by the amount of work this approach must've taken and the fact that they actually pulled it off AND it sounds good.As far as the actual musical style goes, it is rather diverse: Myst's usual introspective oboe melodies and haunting synth textures are augmented by dramatic moments of choral singing and orchestral grandeur, as well as an infusion of world music influences. And of course it's all drenched in the heavy reverb that defines the &quot;Myst sound.&quot; Basically, Jack Wall has taken the scale of the project up a notch, while preserving the spirit of Robyn Miller's sound. Saavedro's music in the concluding scenes is incredible.2) The environment. Each Age is huge. The architecture is achingly beautiful. There are steam tunnels to crawl through, giant hollow plants to climb inside, precarious bridges to cross over redrock canyons, living escalators to ride, and endless other magic. So much loving care has been placed into the design of these environments that you start to forget it's all virtual. There are a few exceptions to the realism. I found the animals in the game (there's this bird I'm thinking of) kind of annoying and not believable as animated creatures, both in terms of their simplistic behavior and their plasticine appearance. Those are exceptions.3) The puzzles. Okay, let's be clear, this isn't a game of reflexes. If you're looking for a shoot-em-up scenario, this ain't it, partner. This is a nonviolent game that is designed to provoke logical and experimental modes of thinking. Some people get frustrated or bored by that. Fortunately for them, there are already plenty of games out there to satisfy their tastes. There are still far too few good puzzle games out there. The puzzles in the Myst series are REAL puzzles: they don't just make you tinker with stuff at random; they ask you to draw connections, deduce the meaning behind things, fill in the missing links with your imagination. What sets Myst 3: Exile's puzzles above the rest is their interconnectedness with the themes and story of the game.4) The 360-degree view. Takes a brief moment to get used to it, and then it's amazing. Works a lot better on my computer than RealMyst's engine, which allowed so much freedom of motion that it was impossible to navigate normally. Myst 3's node-to-node navigation with complete panning freedom provides a happy medium, while still giving the illusion of freedom of motion in the virtual space. Animation movies blend seamlessly into the picture.5) I hated all the disc-switching in Riven. 5 CDs, constantly ejecting and inserting, sheesh! That aggravation is lessened here by the fact that each Age's puzzles are self-contained; thus the island-hopping is minimized. And if you have 2 extra gigs on your hard drive, you can install the entire game there and entirely avoid disc-switching.Summary: this game is lovely. Don't miss it.
A1BMYIK17F3V5G	1	1	Mark McGrain's book is the ideal reference for the musician needing access to the rules of standard musical notation in exact detail. McGrain thoroughly describes the fundamentals of contemporary notation, progressing carefully from the basics into advanced techniques, giving helpful and well-chosen illustrations of every rule along the way. Most critically, the hierarchy of rules and exceptions is laid out in plain English: this is as easy to follow as it gets.Topics covered include: clefs, note-heads, rests, stem length/direction, the logic of accidentals, barlines, time signatures, tempo markings, flags and beams, placement of ties, holds and pauses, repeats, chord symbols, divisi parts, dynamic markings, articulation marks, ornaments, score layout, instrumental transpositions, and then some. The table of contents is nicely organized so as to allow one to quickly & easily find a specific rule in question while one is writing.This is the kind of guide we expect to be logical, consistent, thorough, and concise, so that our creativity doesn't get delayed by technical questions for too long; this book succeeds admirably on all counts. Indispensable for the working composer/musician. Highly recommended for its practical utility.
A1BMYIK17F3V5G	0	0	I got this mouse for the sleek design and its nifty scroll ball - great for zooming and scrolling sideways in audio editing applications.The bad news: the scroll ball stops working. I've been through two of these mice, and both mice lost their ability to scroll downward in a matter of weeks. At first the dysfunction is intermittent, but once the warning signs appear, it's just a matter of time before no amount of cleaning or prayer to the mouse gods will fix the ball. A quick survey of user reviews here and elsewhere confirms that this is indeed a widespread problem. Because the mouse is not made to be easily taken apart and reassembled, there is only so much you can do once its performance starts to deteriorate.The side buttons were so hard to use (because of the awkward position and the forceful grip they required) that I eventually had to deactivate them.Today I gave up, bought a cheaper replacement mouse, and instantly realized that for too long I had been tolerating another serious design flaw in the Mighty Mouse: the touchy sensors that differentiate between a left click and a right click. Even after learning that I had to lift my hand entirely off the opposite side of the mouse, quite often my left clicks were misinterpreted as right clicks, and vice versa. What a relief to abandon the Mighty Mouse's unpredictable behavior, along with the resulting wasted time.This mouse is a nice looker, and one hopes they will soon work out the kinks in the scroll ball concept. But for now I'll settle for a tilt wheel on a more reliable mouse to accomplish my sideways scrolling!
A1BN0YEQ9MZX75	1	1	of all the LIVE albums by the doors, this one is my favorite....great songs, Jim sounds awesome, Fun to listen to!!!!! doors fans, you MUST have this one....
A1BN0YEQ9MZX75	1	1	This book has the lyrics to all the Doors' songs, and even some songs not released. Also included are interviews from magazines, one being with Paul Rothchild, legendary Doors producer. Beautiful photographs throughout make this a great addition to any Doors Fan's bookshelf. Highly recommend if you love The Doors!
A1BN0YEQ9MZX75	1	1	I am in love with this cologne, although listed as a cologne for babies, I use it as a light fragrance. I buy cotton pads used for make-up, and saturate the pad and rub all over I want fragrance. It is so fresh and clean smelling, especially on a hot summer day. I love baby powder, baby lotion smells to begin with and this is great for layering with those products. For $2-$3 you can not beat this for a great smell. I could buy this by the CASE I love it so much!!!!
A1BN0YEQ9MZX75	1	1	This is one of my favorite books about Jim Morrison. We all know there are too many books written about Jim, many from people who never knew him, claim to have known him, claim to have dated him etc....But this is authored by one of Jim's closest friends who has gathered stories about Jim from people who were closest to him. There are so many sweet accounts of jim's generosity, kindness, compassion, intelligence, talent, sense of humor and much more. The pictures are all fabulous. I treasure this book, and pick it up and browse through it all the time. If you love Jim, and want to learn about him from his closest friends-not members of the Doors rehashing all the same myths, then you must own this book.
A1BN0YEQ9MZX75	0	0	If you read all the books about Jim Morrison like I do, make this the one book you skip. It is clearly the life the author WANTED from Jim and never had. wishful thinking, sour grapes, fantasy, lies, FICTION. It made me sick how she talked about Jim loving her, being pregnant (supposedly). Fact is, jim had no less than 10 paternity suits pending at the time of his death, all women who were obsessed with him. This is just another one of those people. SKIP IT!
A1BN7E8ZL2AR8S	1	1	Gardner's Art through the Ages gives a comprehensive picture of art history. How can a student learn all the material in this book? The student can buy this study guide. It is gives excellent and thought-provoking questions. The parallel textbook doesn't have questions like other books, so this book is absolutely key to learning art history. Whether you are in a high school Advanced Placement art history course or in an introductory college course, buy this book. It asks questions about important points in art history, has &quot;discussion questions&quot; and has a special feature where the student fills out a chart of the important works of a period.
A1BN7E8ZL2AR8S	1	1	Not often does a newspaper of The Times' eminence publish its in-house style and usage guide. (Writers of 1976 last saw an edition of this book.) This guide gives students, teachers and professionals the tools to write well. I have found many usage notes that I did not previously know.I found that this book borders on being a tad too politically correct.It doesn't reach the point of crossing this border, but it does come close. It insists that people call cripples a people who have lost the use of their legs.Also, this book could have included a few more grammar terms that the average person would not know. There are too many terms that the average educated person knows, like when to use &quot;a/an.&quot; What the book could have summed up in two sentences encompassed almost a page. Conversely, what should have taken up a page, the book treated in a few sentences.Further, it seems like the book purposely omitted esoteric newspaper terms that would be found in the in-house edition found at The Times' headquarters at 229 West 43rd. I'd really like to have read about the various font sizes and columns and the like. But the authors decided for me that I was apt not to be interested in reading about that arcanca.Otherwise, this book is an enjoyable read. BUY IT, STUDY IT! (You should also buy Stunk's and White's The Elements of Style, also available for purchase here on Amazon.com)

A1BN7E8ZL2AR8S	1	0	I came to "A Question of Intent" as a stalwart pro-tobacco reader. I've often attacked David Kessler -- doctor, lawyer, teacher -- and his Food and Drug Administration with all my energy. After reading his book, I saw the light and it was emanating from the proverbial ember of truth. Dr. Kessler's book completely changed my view on whether the FDA should regulate nicotine. He so completely reveals the dishonesty and foolishness of the pro-tobacco side that I felt embarrassed to be on it. I'm still pro-tobacco, but his book gave me a perspective of an anti-smoker movement to which I never gave much credit. Reading his book was reading a detective story, with ex-FBI, ex-CIA and army agents at center stage.Dr. Kessler takes the reader, in superbly crafted prose, through his investigation that began with his subordinate imploring him to look into cigarette regulation. Even when faced with false civil -- and a few times, criminal -- charges, Dr. Kessler and his team persevere. By book's end, Kessler cynically concludes that the tobacco industry needs to be dismantled and administered by a quasi-government corporation.(One complaint: I agree with The New York Times' review book that his constant attempt to deflect credit seems disingenuous. He reminds us way so often that other people deserve credit that he seems to be hiding something. This might not be intentional, but it still raises questions in the reader that detracts from the narrative.)What makes "A Question of Intent" so outstanding is the way Kessler logically dissects each point put forth by the industry on why the FDA shouldn't regulate nicotine. Each of my clashes with the proposed regulations was addressed in this book. He even interviews Steve Parrish, a current executive at Philip Morris, who provides candid explanations and amplification. My favorite line comes from Mr. Parrish, as quoted by Dr. Kessler: "When you are talking only to yourselves, you begin to believe your own bull--."You'll enjoy it, whatever side you're on.
A1BNAK115TPGET	1	1	If you want a Ozzy CD. Get this one. A great mix of heaviness (Mr.Tinkertrain, I Don't Want to Change the World) and softness (Road to Nowhere, No More Tears) Only 2 bad songs : Mama, I'm Coming Home &amp; Zombie Stop
A1BNCVK8BBRTQA	1	1	I bought this CD having not heard one song off of it. I've been a DM fan for years, and was thrilled that they'd released a new album.The first time I listened to it, I was so disappointed that I almost wanted to cry. I told everyone that it just wasnt very good, and couldn't believe it from one of my favorite bands.Over the past few weeks, I've listened to it here and there, and I'm now convinced that this is a very, very cool collection of songs, and plan to retract my previous statements. It's classic DM in so many ways, and yet, quite different.I ask any detractors to give it another listen. It grows on you, it really does!
A1BNCVK8BBRTQA	0	0	Despite it's mixed reviews, I decided to give this book a try. I should have known better. It is absolute dreck. The choppiness of the writing makes it difficult to follow. It's almost as if it was written in a stream of conciousness style, except I doubt there was much conciousness behind it to begin with.The "heroine" of the novel, while booksmart, is so incredibly lacking in street smarts that it makes her character totally unbelievable and ridiculous. She's such a highly selfish and pathetic character, that I found myself groaning in parts because of the stupid situations that she puts herself in.Without giving it all away, the "shocking" final scene is hardly that. Anyone with half a brain will figure it all out long beforehand. The clues are there, and so patently obvious, that the "twists" fall flat, and the character in question gets what she deserves for hampering the murder case that she's involved in.
A1BNXESSIKXSM2	1	1	Baldacci often writes fiction based on politics and Washington. The Winner is different and I think it shows his skill in writing something fresh. The plot has some very new twists - fixing the lottery, for example. The story has some amazing or rather incredible parts (escaping New York with a full hunt on; her boyfriend summoning the U.S. Attorney General and the FBI Director to quickly negotiate with him, etc.) The main characters are quite engaging. LuAnn, the poor girl who becomes rich, and Jackson, the diabolical genius mastermind, are quite memorable. Charlie is a less developed character who spend years with LuAnn, lives with her overseas but inexplicably has no romantic interest in her or apparently with anyone else for that matter. But, this is escapist literature and Baldacci does an excellent job in moving the story along with great suspense. I found the book to be engrossing and a satisfying read. I read the Kindle version and I wholeheartedly recommend this book.
A1BNXESSIKXSM2	0	0	We have a Bichon Poo and we are trying to keep her away from an area of the house. Although I read reviews noting that the charge on this barrier product must be so weak to have little deterrent effect, I thought this may be the case for bigger dogs and not smaller dogs. Wrong. This PetSafe Pawz Away did not work as a barrier at all. We tested the barrier several times and heard the beeps. Nonetheless, the little dog walked right through and continued to eat the cat food we were trying to keep her away from. Height was not an issue since we tested it at the dog's height. I do not recommend this product.
A1BNXESSIKXSM2	1	1	This Lenmar battery works well, was very affordable and lasted about what I can recall the new Canon battery as lasting. This battery worked well with my older Canon Powershot Digital Elph SD 400 as well as my newer SD 1400 IS and is much cheaper than the Canon battery. I bought two and I am happy with my purchase. I recommend it.
A1BO3Y20XSAZJE	1	0	I recently viewed Apocalypse Now Redux on cable, and even more recently purchased the DVD of the original cut of Apocalypse Now. To anyone who has never seen the movie, I strongly suggest that you watch the original cut first. It is by far the better movie, and I would easily give it five stars.Naturally, I was chomping at the bit to see the expanded movie. Who wouldn't be excited at the prospect of seeing so much added footage to one of their favorite films? And it is interesting, of course, to see all the scenes that were left out. Alas, they're not very good, they slow the movie down, and, although they do add interesting character development, they dilute the film's power considerably.The French plantation scene is both boring and puzzling, the playmate scene is creepy and incomplete, and such business as stealing the surfboard diminsihes the impact of the preceding scene.I have no idea what happened to Coppola's judgment. But the first cut is the product of the vision of the man who made the first two Godfather films, while the new cut seems to reflect the judgment of the man who made the third Godfather movie and Jack. I mean no disrespect to Mr. Coppola, and I continue to hope that he will yet make a movie that can compare to his towering achievements of the 70's. But although he has made some good movies since the One From the Heart disaster (I'm quite fond of Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance), his output of the last two decades no longer places him in the first rank of directors, I'm sorry to say.I guess my basic advice to you is to rent the original cut. If you like it, then of course, you'll want to see the long version (Redux). Then make up your own mind. I'm sure that many of you will disagree with me. But I truly believe that you'll have a better chance of recognizing that this is one of the greatest films ever if you see it as Coppola originally conceived it.
A1BO3Y20XSAZJE	1	1	I bought the original vinyl when it came out and have been listening to it ever since. I had no idea until I bought the box set that the "closet mix" (which is the vinyl mix I have) is rare. That said, and noting that in any mix this is a great album, there are pros and cons. IMO, the rockers, like Beginning to See the Light and What Goes On, sound better in this mix (sorry, Lou). However, some songs are better in the closet mix, which is apparently now available only on the box set Peel Slowly and See. The most glaring change is Some Kind of Love where they actually used a different take! The closet mix is far superior, IMO. See, what happened is that after they laid down the tracks, Lou took the master tape and re-mixed it, bringing the vocals far to the front and keeping the instruments way in the background. This was the original release. I don't know when the ehgineer got a hold of it and made more "commercial mixes" (yeah, right), but that is what is available on CD unless you buy the box set. You won't do badly. Even someone like me, who is both a purist and a fan who has been listening to the "closet mix" for almost forty years, can appreciate it. But you owe it to yourself to find a way to hear the alternate mix and decide for yourself.
A1BO3Y20XSAZJE	1	1	Wilson's collection is an excellent resource for clinicians. More than most books that are based in psychoanalytic theory, this volume is of immediate and lasting use in the practice of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Highly recommended to practitioners, if you can find it. Much of the book should be of interest to non-specialists, as well.
A1BO3Y20XSAZJE	1	1	OK. All Right. There seems to be a gigantic split of opinion on this one. My opinion:1. What you find fightening is as individual as what makes you laugh. Personally, this literally gave me nightmares. That hasn't happened since I was a kid. But I don't know what scares you: werewolves? vampires? final exams? IRS audits?2. It must be admitted - Campbell takes an ungodly amount of time getting the book going. I enjoyed the shifting third person limited points of view. I also found some of it mildly funny, and the soap opera elements also interested me. But it is not remotely scary until over half way through. Be prepared for that, don't read it, or skip to the middle. You'll not understand the characters as well if you skip, but it may be the best way for some of you to read this.3. The ending offers no explanations (although one is sort of alluded to earlier in the book). The fates of all the characters are not detailed, nor do we have a Monday morning wrap-up of what the world makes of what happened in the store overnight. I didn't feel that it needed that sort of ending, but you may.4. The character of Woody is such an over-the-top American stereotype that it is somewhat distracting. He becomes in effect a secondary villain. I don't remember such scorn for Americans in previous Campbell novels. Post-Iraq War anger, maybe?If you can deal with these caveats, buy this book and enjoy. Personally I loved it.
A1BO5807UPI7J3	0	1	After 2-3 months of use by our cat, it broke (the rake mechanism won't move). So we sent a part back and the receipt as told by their service dept along with $10 and they sent a new one. Now about 3 months later that one is broken. So, I'm assuming we won't be able to get one again since we sent in the receipt the first time. Sometimes it got stuck and kept going back and forth because the rake got stuff stuck on it. I would recommend either buying a sturdier/more powerful box (maybe that would work) or a different brand. When it works it is awesome though.
A1BO5807UPI7J3	0	0	The Sona Pillow was bulky, uncomfortable, impractical, noisy, made my neck sore, and didn't stop my snoring at all according to my wife. Brookstone has no-refund policy for the Sona pillow, even if you are TOTALLY dissatisfied.The pillow itself a funky shape that seemed king-sized (it was really pushing the limits for a queen-sized bed). The pillowcase is custom fitted to the pillow. You can't use regular pillowcases. It comes with a pillowcase on it, but additional pillowcases cost $20 a piece. There are two sewn "sleeves" (small square of fabric sewn on both sides of the square) under the pillowcase so you can put whichever arm you want under the pillow while you "train" yourself to sleep on your side. If you have a really big arm, it probably won't fit. When you put your arm through it, it has to go somewhere and mine was uncomfortably pushed up against the headboard and hanging off in such a way that I was a little worried I might knock something off of my nightstand. I also noticed that the pillow sqeaked when it rubbed against my headboard (my old pillow never squeaked). When I woke up in the morning, my neck ached and I learned that I had been snoring as loudly as usual all night.I boxed up the pillow in its original packaging and less than a week later I decided I'd call up Brookstone to request a refund (you need an RMA number from them to send it back). The first rep I spoke with just gave me the company line over and over that it was a "personal product" and Brookstone doesn't take returns or make refunds if they have been used at all. I said I was extremely dissatisfied with the pillow and I wanted to speak to his supervisor. He said he would have to leave her a voicemail because she was on another call. I said I'd hold, but then he said I couldn't do that and she didn't have the ability to have me on "hold", which was a lie. I told him I had a friend that was a lawyer, so he put me on hold so I could speak with her. When I spoke with his supervisor, she eventually said a lot of people that have called into Brookstone were similarly displeased with the Sona pillow. She also said that some people called in with praise. But she said though that no matter how displeased a customer is with the pillow (or any other personal product), you cannot get a refund. I asked for her supervisor, got his voice mail, and left a message.I would suggest staying far away from this pillow unless you have money to burn. It's great if it helps some people, but it didn't help me, and I'm thoroughly displeased with both the product and with Brookstone's refusal to refund the $100 I spent on it.
A1BO5807UPI7J3	0	1	Started up once for several seconds, then I shut it down and it would not start again. Very surprising considering that all of the box and stickers on the power supply it says that it was 100% quality assured. It said on the box that it came with a 3-year guarantee, but I did a brief search on the web and on YouTube and saw a number of people that said Diablotek power supplies fail often. I guess I'll contact the vendor or Diablotek and try to get another one, but considering I've never had a replacement power supply die almost immediately like this, I'm not holding out much hope in future reliability.
A1BOJC49CDF3NK	1	1	My daughter received this for her 1 year old birthday and she LOVES it! It is her favorite toy out of all the ones she received. It teaches not only musical notes, instruments and the musical scale but also has another option for letters and numbers. My daughter can play with this for almost an hour by herself, and then comes back for more later on! She is so delighted with this table because it is so easy to do things herself; whereas some other toys have buttons that are harder to push, etc. I don't even mind all the noise this toy makes; I find myself singing the tunes sometimes! Great overall and A+++! The best birthday present ever!
A1BOJC49CDF3NK	1	1	This hamper is wonderful and holds a ton of dirty baby clothes, if needed. I also like the fact that it doesn't take up alot of space, you can easily wash the cover and its a snap to reassemble! A+++!
A1BOJC49CDF3NK	0	0	I bought 3 of these changing pad covers and they have all done the same thing. As soon as you wash them they start to get long strings all over them! I have tried cutting them off, but as soon as you wash it again, you get more. Its really frustrating that they are made of such poor material.
A1BONHQNULETMN	1	1	I loved reading all the reviews about the Kindle, and waited impatiently to get mine. We all have our reasons to want the Kindle. Now that I have my own Kindle, I'll share two of my reasons.REASON #1I love to read fiction, but I only allow myself that guilty pleasure when I'm working out on a treadmill. My sadistic mind tells me that as long as I'm improving my physical health, I am free to read for amusement and distraction from the boredom of a treadmill. My rule is to only read fiction while walking or jogging, so it keeps me moving for longer periods. I also look forward to the next workout to continue my book.However, reading while walking on the treadmill is difficult to do with the usual books. They just don't stay open. I've fashioned all kinds of devices to keep them open, especially near the beginning and the end of the book when the pages become unbalanced. I've cracked spines in so many places the pages start to fall out. Lighting can be a problem, and I've tried reading lamps. They usually fail because I have to move them around to get a good angle for the right or left side of the page spread.In addition to the usual considerations for buying books, I used to evaluate which hardback books to buy based on whether it would fit on the treadmill. I'd consider the weight of the book, the type size, and whether the copy was too compressed on the page. Finally, I am motivated to move with upbeat music while I'm walking.I'm happy to report that with the Kindle and the nifty little reading lamp, all problem are solved (except for my neurosis!) I can access plenty of books cheaper than hardbacks. I can flip the pages without fiddling with the clips I used to keep the books flat. I can listen to music. I can increase the type size. I love it.Can anyone recommend a good therapist? Or--better yet--a Kindle book to help me with my neurosis?REASON #2I travel in airplanes nearly every week. I'm loaded down with electronics these days: Blackberry, laptop, IPOD, GPS, Bose headphones, and at times my Sony camera. (I know you can combine some of these things, but that's another story.) I'm only too happy to add the Kindle to lighten my book load. I send myself PDF and Word documents to read, and I don't have to boot up my laptop for reading files. I regularly do this from the Blackberry because PDF files are impossible to read.When the guy in the middle seat has to get up, it is much easier to get out of his way with no laptop to manuever. And, no one knows what I am reading (even if I cheat and peek at my novel). When I don't want to be bothered, I put on my giant Bose headphones so that I can tune out all the noise.Only problem is that you can't read it during taxi, takeoff, or landing. So, I'm stuck with the regular magazine. I just do the Sudoku puzzle.
A1BONHQNULETMN	0	1	The story of identical twins got my attention, and is the reason I purchased this book. It was so slow, that I nearly stopped half way through. I kept reading because I was curious, and I read it on the Kindle, where it is a little more difficult to peek forward!It was just plain corny. A perfect estate on the Hudson in NY. Two beautiful, glamorous, rich twins -- perfect in every way -- from the tiny waists to beautiful hair, delicate features, impeccable taste, horseback riding skills, blah, blah, blah. However, they are completely identical except for a small mole -- and except for their personalities. Olivia is the perfect attentive daughter, perfect flawless hostess, perfect sensitive sister, homemaker, etc. Victoria is the opposite--a completely self absorbed beauty searching for excitement in the early 1900's.Victoria falls in love with a dashing, but very-married scoundrel. She gets pregnant, he dumps her, and (after a miscarriage) she narrowly avoids a huge scandal by being forced to marry the very guy her dear sister secretly loves. Of course, he's handsome, smart, successful, wonderful, and wants a mother for his perfect son.After the perfect wedding, Victoria just can't get over the dastardly married guy who very cruelly and callously dumped her. Her new husband knows it all and still wants to make the marriage work, even though she completely avoids the dear boy, and rejects her understanding husband.Most of the book leads up to the SWITCH, which is a fairly obvious after all the endless blathering about how identical they are. It seems like the author is just trying to add pages by rehashing how breathtakingly beautiful the twins are, how identical they look, how they switched when they were kids, etc. Over and over and over and over and over again.There are a lot of errors in the editing -- maybe the conversion to the Kindle through some sort of OCR. Some words just pop up and mean nothing.This is my first (and probably only) Danielle Steel novel.
A1BOZ4BS56B2ZI	1	1	Its a comedy NOT a real gangster flick. Its pretty funny! Jason Mewes did well and Hyung-Rae Shim was hilarious as Harvey Keitel son. Was worth the money spent on the rental.
A1BOZ4BS56B2ZI	1	1	Movie is great. He speaks like a martial artist...always seeking perfection, always learning. Loved it! Id even throw down to taste his Sushi.
A1BP1NE4OLX6A5	1	1	The Alchemist is an educational work that provides its reader the ability to choose whatever lesson they need learn. There are many interesting short-stories within the main story, and a dozen or so lessons one has the option of "taking" from said stories.I respect the author's ability to provide such an intelligent, intriguing and thought-provoking masterpiece through easy-to-read text. His lack of "big words" only demonstrates his brilliance.Excellent story- a must read!
A1BP3AVHDZL2SM	1	1	This album is perfect. Before listening to this album, I had never heard of Wilco. Now they are one of my favorite bands ever. This album is not commercially accessable and it shouldnt, because commercial music sucks. From start to finish it is amazing. Everything comes together perfectly. This is truly on of the best records of my lifetime.
A1BP3AVHDZL2SM	1	1	My writing has improved 200% because of the information presented in this book. I am a junior marketing major at Northern Illinois University. This text is enjoyable to read with great visuals and equally interesting real- world examples. I will definitely keep this book. The skills learned from this book will guide me in my career for years to come. Thank you for writing this book and to my professor for choosing this book.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	First, let me say I am a bit taken aback by one reviewers comments about how the book was filled with "minor" characters and other such as Robt. E Lee are only lightly touched upon.You have GOT to be kidding. I can't think of another time in history that's been over-written about more than the civil war. If a reader is looking for a general historical overview of the civil war, then I would say this book is not for you, but I don't think the author was trying to lead people to believe that this was was THAT book either. This was a refreshing read on a topic (the civil war) that I've read many times over. Unlike other books that focused on the major players and the various battles of the civil war, this book focused (exactly as the title suggests) on Richmond Va and about a months time right before during and right after the end of the civil war.I found it an easy read and anyone interested in the history of this city but not the civil war will likely enjoy this book.For those of us wanted more and more of Robt. E Lee, I suggest you look elsewhere, and no doubt you won't have far to go...
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	I can't disagree with some reviewers who said it felt unfinished or somehow lacking. It did, but it's only slightly longer than 200 pages, so while if I'd read a 600 page book and felt that way, that would be more of a problem.Overall, I think Wilson had a story in mind, and largely he told it and told it well, as he always does.If your new to Wilson, this might not be the best book of his to start with. I've read about half of his books so far and Spin is by far my favorite so far.Still, I enjoyed this book and definately recommend it to anyone that's already read his other books and liked them.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	This was a very good book imho. I've read 4 of Wilson's books now (looking forward to the rest). I would rank this just behind Spin so far. This was a different book. I also liked the way he told this story. You spend the first 1/2 of the book having really no idea how or why the continent of europe was transformed, then right out of nowhere, he provides a basic structure of how/why, then armed with that knowledge your propeled into the 2nd half of the book.It's part sci-fi, part theology with adventure mixed in. Good book, I am ever more impressed with this author the more books of his I read.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	0	1	This bag lasted me about 2 months before one of the straps started coming out of it's stitching, and I don't mean a little.It's too bad because otherwise I really liked this case, but the manufacturer decided saving a few pennies was worth more than extra stitching where it was needed most.Avoid this bag!!!
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	First, this book is a quick and easy read. At just under 170 pages, it shouldn't take up much of anyone's time.I found on the surface, the story itself flowed very well and I easily followed the main character through his travels to the end of his journey. If nothing else, I found pleasure in reading a clear, simple adventure that takes the reader on a journey.Intermixed with this story the author uses his story to insert his religious beliefs and ideas about the nature of our world. I didn't necessarily agree with all of them, but again, I think his message was a very simple and direct one. If you follow your dream, you can't fail. I happen to believe that. No matter how hard the journey, if you believe strong enough in something, you will persevere. Even if you don't believe in the spiritual/religious ideas he presents, I think most people can respect and understand perseverence and following your own path no matter what the obstacles.I think the beauty of this book is that it hits you at multiple levels, story, personal journey, religious faith. You aren't forced to "buy" into the whole package to come away with being touched by this story.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	First, as the title of my review implies I *did* enjoy this book, and I *would* recommend this book.In a nutshell, it was a good story, put together well, well told, easily read with a good ending. Nothing wrong there, but that's as far as it takes the reader.To those of you going into this book expecting the next great american novel, or "the best book you ever read" as I have seen more than a few describe it in other reviews, um.. no. Not even close.I think all the reviews and even the critics reviews have done this otherwise very good book an injustice. You will not find wisdom in it's pages, nor will you laugh/cry/etc (at least I didn't).So, if you go into reading this book with the expectation of a good read, you won't be dissapointed. If your looking for something special, I just didn't find it in this book.In the end, my criticism isn't with this book, but all the incorrect accolades poured upon it.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	I really like this camera. I have 3 cameras currently (all different brands) and this one is the only one at 480 horiz lines and boy is it noticeable during daylight. It's just much crisper. I would't think 60 pixels would make that much of a difference but it does. Very clear, focused.Another reviewer commented about it not being so good at night, and I have to agree, my q-See which does not look as good in daylight, is better at night. The night vision is acceptable, but I found it seemed a bit over-exposed in the center and underexposed on the fringes. Think of a circle about 75% of the screen area, with everything in the circle over-exposed (too bright) and everything outside under exposedOverall, I still like this camera.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	0	0	First, I bought this product primarily because I wanted something that I could access over the internet. That was it's first strike. Not only was it NOT web based access (it was a VERY poorly written windows applications) but the windows app was the ONLY way you could interact with this machine from another computer. If they had made it so I could have access these video files via a simple website, FTP, Windows Share, anything I would have simply shucked their app and access the videos directly and viewed in my video player of choice (Windows Media, VLC anything). To make matters worse, try as I might, while I was able to view the live feeds in the windows apps, I was never able to download any recordings. I'm still baffled why they didn't at the very least enable an FTP connection to it??Second, the motion detection was terrible. First, let me preface by saying the particular camera I was testing this with had a field-of vision of about 50 feet, it was mounted up high and pointing down, so it's not like I was pointing it out into a field. So, set to medium, it took a car driving by to trigger it, nothing else, people, dogs would cause the motion to go off. If I set it to the next level up, it recorded 24x7, never stopped, every leaf blowing in the wind caused it to continuously trigger. This happened with all 3 cameras I had (one of them I might add was a q-see camera).finally, it locked up me a number of times. Not all the time, but enough for me not to trust it, which is paramount with unattended surveillance
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	0	0	I bought this camera because of the large distance it claimed to cover in darkness.First, let me preface by saying that with regard to night-vision this camera did not work at all, it simply was defective and I returned it, so with regard to it's night-vision capabilities I can't say good or bad except that it was a complete bust in that regard.The quaility of the day-light operation is the reason I gave this camera 1 star, it was TERRIBLE. By far the worst camera I've owned (I deliberately bought 3 different brands to get a sense of which ones I'd like best since I intend over time to buy as many as 8 or more). I was a bit shocked at just how BAD the image was in daylight, and just so it's clear, I was able to instantaneously compare it against my other 2 cameras since I had all three hooked up to the same system. The colors were garrish, it was like it was on uber-contrast mode, and even after adjusting with my dvr system, it stil didn't get much better. I was also quite a bit darker than the other 2 cameras. About an hr before dusk, it look like darkness was minutes away, while the other two looked clear and bright.I might add also this was the most expensive of the three cameras and quite a bit more expensive than the cheapest one.Luckily I was able to return this and get my money back.the other two cameras btw were a Lorex and a Qsee, the Lorex is my favorite, the qSee wasn't great, but it was adequate and I'm keeping both of them.In the end, considering the high-price of this camera, I am left wondering if I just got a complete dud and it was broken in more ways that the night-vision IR's. I am rather surprised they could sell this for nearly $200 at the level of quality I witnessed...
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	0	0	First off, I can't really comment on this device if your going to be using it with windows, only Mac.I bought this based on other reviewers as well as the fact that it was the only USB skype phone I could find that had drivers for OSX.The good things about this phone are the following :- Excellent sound quality. I can't say anything negative on this front.- VERY light- compact size.- long cord (though I wish like the philips phone I had before this that it provided a groove around the outer edge of the phone to wind the cord around the phone).The OSX "driver" is another issue. Overall when you boot up it works fine, my problem is that since I'm using it with a laptop, my laptop invariably goes to sleep or I will shut the lid and go grab lunch etc. When I return and start using my computer, if I try and use the phone, it's totally disconnected from Skype. I have to unload skype, unload the driver, then reload to get it working again. For casual use, I could recommend this phone. If like another person said in their reviews if you just want a phone to call home with or make an occasional call, again I would recommend. If your like me however and wanted to use this as a phone to use throughout the day and rely on it to make and receive calls, you might think again. I have had numerous occasions where I've answered and I get nothing. People get a bit impatient when you have to always call them back and explain away your phone problems.Overall I think the "driver" overshot here. First I originally had a philips phone that had NO OSX drivers. It worked great as a handset, but the buttons didn't work. So this driver only needed to handle the ability to use the keypad on it. The mic/speaker should have been left to the OS (which I'm sure would ordinarily work without any drivers. If they'd done that at least I wouldn't be answering calls and either not hearing the other party or the other party not hearing me. Instead they appear to have tried to write drivers for the mic/speaker which means they seem to think they know better than apple... probably the reason it's having issues.I would also add if your buying this for a desktop system that will mostly be on (you can't close the lid on a desktop ;) ) this would probably work better for you than for me on a laptop.So, overall a mixed review. I like this phone, but it's dependability for moderate to heavy use just isn't there.

A1BP56R6PLX8KG	1	1	I've been reading RCW for a few years now and he's become one of my favorite authors.This book, though one of his early works, is remarkably well written and fast-paced.If your a fan of RCW, I would say there's nothing here to dissapoint, to those that have not read him before, I highly recommend this book.One caution, RCW tends not to wrap things up in a nice neat bow. He builds a framework for a story but mostly he focuses on the characters and the journey they take through the book. If your the type of person that wants everything answered and neat/complete endings, then RCW may not be for you.
A1BP56R6PLX8KG	0	1	I think calling the Killer Angels "historical fiction" is quite a stretch, in fact from having read this book most of his disagreements come from assumptions that Shaara made about the main characters thoughts and reasons for making the decisions they did. With Lee, as we all know, we have no 1st hand biography of him as he never wrote one. I believe it's a perfectly legitimate argument to question and propose alternate answers to "why" these characters did what they did, but what cannot be disputed is what they did do, and for the most part the Killer Angels was accurate in that regard, which brings me back to this author labeling the Killer Angels "Historical Fiction". To me historical fiction is fiction that occurs within the context of real historical events. One example of this would be "North and South". I would think any person with any bit of knowledge of the Civil War would understand that "North and South" would accurately be described as Historical Fiction and the Killer Angels would NOT

In none of the OSes this cable could establish connectivity. Plugging any of my other 3ft cables in established connectivity right away.I do not have any other devices to connect with this cable, but I am pretty sure that I am not dealing with a length issue here. If the cable was too long for the voltage I think my FW HD would at least be somewhat visible to any my OSes, instead of complete silience.So I need to classify this Belkin cable as defective right out-of-the-box and am returning it. Am ordering this one now insteadhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PRE1XI/sr=1-18/qid=1279431265/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me;=&qid;=1279431265&sr;=1-18&seller;=
A1BP9TZ86TNEDI	0	0	the concentration HAS to be mentioned, but it isn't - guess why?Here it is from other web sites offering this product:Serving Size: 2 Drops (0.125 ml) contain 150 mcg (micro grams) of Potassium Iodidethat means that 100 ml contain 0.120 g of Potassium Iodide, which again equals a concentration of only 0.12% !!!Or in other words - useless? Just money making on their side?Also: contains preservative Sodium Benzoate. This ALSO needs to be mentioned, as Sodium Benzoate is an allergant.
A1BP9TZ86TNEDI	1	0	I purchased this adapter here @ Amazon February 4, 2009. It stopped working 9/16/2011, which can simply happen with ANY electronic eq - no blame on Sabrent for that. I opened a ticket @ Sabrent. They had me send the defective one in, offering a replacement. The entire process took quite a while - I guess they used the very cheapest shipping to Hawaii, without tracking # - but today, 11/15/2011, I picked up a new working unit from the PO (which might have been there for a couple of days already), so I'm happy again.I own a Vantec CB-ISATAU2, too, also purchased here @ Amazon, which is why I did not mind the two months without the Sabrent too much (when you offer computer hardware support you need a backup adapter anyway - everything else would not be professional). Speed-wise I'd say they are the same (haven't measured exactly).I deducted one star because - in contrast to the Vantec CB-ISATAU2 - the Sabrent does not have a switch in the power line. Remember, it is depreciated to pull the power supply right at the connected HD since the resulting vibrations can harm the heads which are still spinning.... that's the main reason why Vantec inserted a switch. With the Sabrent you actually have to pull the power plug at the PSU, which is a bit awkward.
A1BPH1WY1FQSV5	0	0	I had such great expectations when I picked up "The Book of Shadows," and sadly, those expectations were not met. As a practitioner of the Craft, I was dismayed to see the usual stereotypes of witches and other supernatural types trotted out and given a Wes Craven treatment by Mr. Reese. All of his "research" on the subject could easily be gotten off the Internet or by purchasing some of those icky "how-to-practice-witchcraft" books that any teenager has in her/his bedroom. His historial research is also faulty. For example, the story begins somewhere in France circa 1830 in a convent school which we are to believe has an ancient provenance. Surprise! The Revolution disbanded most religious orders in France and only a few were able to regroup and reorganize themselves, but then only after Napoleon was toppled. And the Ursulines' habit is black, not brown. Overall, the story suffers from Mr. Reese's inability to form a narrative and keep it flowing. There are lengthy flashbacks dealing with the back-stories of several characters that are so wordy you can skip whole pages and not miss any vital plot development. This is one of the most boring books purporting to be Gothic horror that I have ever read!
A1BPH1WY1FQSV5	1	1	I have read only one of Mr. Grisham's novels, but the nature of this horrible story compelled me to purchase it and devour it in on a recent flight from LA to NYC. This well-told tale of a frightening miscarriage of "justice," occuring not in some third-world country under a despotic military ruler, but in late 20th-century Oklahoma, will leave you shaken to the core of your being. If you are at all familiar with the criminal justice system, and not, as some of the reviewers of this book seem to be, simply by watching "CSI" or other such drivel on television, you will appreciate the skill with which Mr. Grisham researched his material and presented it clearly, concisely, and with a minimum of finger-pointing. That is rare indeed today in the world of non-fiction writers. I also do not understand why some of the reviewers of this book have called is "depressing," or "dark" - it's not a novel, it's real life, folks! And yes, it is about some of the most miserable of human beings, our death row inmates - and there are no clean-cut Hollywood stars, or pretty locations, or sexy starlets to pepper its pages. This is a dirty, blood and guts story out of the heartland of America and should strike fear into the heart of anyone who reads it, as we are all potential victims of a system than can sometimes go terribly awry. As an attorney, I applaud Mr. Grisham for making Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz's story more widely available to the public. It shames the jurisdiction of Ada, Oklahoma and the corrupt police force, prosecutors, and judges who sentenced these innocent men to over ten years behind bars on the flimsiest of evidence while neglecting to pursue the most likely suspect in the crime. Justice? Absolutely not, for even after their charges were dismissed, the only apology they received from the great state of Oklahoma was in the nature of a monetary settlement, and then only after a civil rights suit had been filed on their behalf. This story should be compulsory reading for every law student and attorney in this country - a reminder how much power can corrupt and sway "reasonable men" to commit atrocitices in the name of justice. I rarely give any book a five-star rating, but "The Innocent Man" clearly deserves to be read.
A1BPH1WY1FQSV5	0	0	There is a good reason this author has not published any more of these so-called novels (they are really novellas, folks) about her witch-slash-amateur detective, Bast: They aren't very good. I slugged through the trilogy contained in "Bell, Book and Murder" and felt as if I'd consumed the greasiest and least-nutritious meal on the planet. They have all the trappings of a series of books dealing with folks who are Wiccans, but RE is not as skillful a writer as she'd have you believe. I am halfway through the third novella and I still don't know much about Lady Bast - she is a cipher of the most annoying and vexing sort. RE drops a few hints here and there - (SPOILER ALERTS!): Bast is about 36, has black hair, probably was a nun in her early years (although so far, I've read nothing confirming that rather delectible tid-bit), and while she confesses to be straight spends a lot more time with her gay sisters in the Craft. RE peoples her books with characters who came out of the Broom Closet's Central Casting Department - they are caricatures of the worst sort, superficial, predictable to a fault, and without any soul whatsoever. RE forgets one of the basic tenets of fiction writing: No on will care a whit about your book or your characters unless they can identify in some fashion with them and what goes on in their heads. Bast speaks like a would-be Raymond Chandler with a heavy dose of Don Rickles; does she even LIKE her friends, coven-mates, or even the people she works with? Her cracking wise about all sorts of Wiccan issues gets on your nerves at about page 5. If you have so much disdain and contempt for the people who practice "your" religion, why bother? But perhaps my biggest gripe about these books is how sophomoric and simplistic they are. One can see through the plots quite easily - if plots you can call them. When a certain dark character makes an appearance (usually late in the game) one can almost hear the big, loud, diminished chords resounding from the soundtrack along with a big pink neon arrow pointing to him saying "Watch out! Bad guy!" I moved beyond that kind of fiction when I was in third grade (viz., the Nancy Drew books). Indeed, I read "Dark Shadows" fan fiction years ago that was more carefully constructed and engaging than any of these novellas.Unless you are new to the genre and are desperate for something to read as Halloween approaches that deals somewhat facilely with Wiccans and their foibles and follies, avoid these books like the plague.
A1BPJ58UUDEVMD	0	0	I'm a big fan of Gail Kim and waited very patiently for this film to come out. I knew going in that it was going to be a cheap B-Movie, but that didn't bother me. The movie plot is somewhat intriguing, but is very messy. The film goes for about a half hour after you see what should have been the climax. It's worth a watch for any Gail Kim fan, but anyone else probably won't like it.
A1BPJ58UUDEVMD	1	1	I just picked this movie up after looking at some reviews on-line. First off, this is not a zombie movie. It is a tale of suspense and horror in the same vein as The War of the Words radio broadcast with the feeling of isolation you get from 28 Days Later. You'll want to watch it again to pick up on all of the subtle nuances that are laced throughout the film. It was horrific while maintaining an intelligent story. Truly awesome!
A1BPJ58UUDEVMD	1	1	I noticed most of the bad reviewers for the Recon series didn't even finish the film. That's like writing a book review after reading the first chapter. Personally I love this series, it fills the hole of not having enough Starship Trooper movies. Yeah it's low budget and some of the effects are laughable. But so what? This movie delivers on everything it promises to be. A gratuitous serving of action, violence, gore, some laughs, and nudity for good measure. So when you're ready for a movie that's light on story and heavy on gory, pick up Recon 2020 and it's sequels. I love this series and eagerly await Recon 2024: The Rise of the Merch.
A1BPJ58UUDEVMD	1	0	This DVD promised some great matches. But, sad to say, a couple of them were chopped up into highlights. Enjoy it for what it is. I got this DVD as a Christmas present, and it was probably selling for $1.95 at the time. Totally worth that price. Understand that these matches are either "indy" matches or they're from Mexico. So you're not going to get high quality audio and video production you're going to get from WWE. The matches themselves hold up very well. Again, I was very disappointed that the Eddie Guerrero & Art Barr vs Santo & Octagon match was nothing but clips. I know it was a great match and some of you have probably seen the aftermath of this match. But on this DVD, you don't even get a coherent story from the match. Otherwise, this is a great deal.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	0	1	Very nice. My wife loved it up until the second week when (still alto left) it stop spraying. Wouldn't buy it again because of that.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I use this always except for meat. I got the silicone ones with pictures on it to stop cross contamination. Buy this.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Perfect. I love it. I had Remington's but this was the best yet and great price. Only thing the top comes off alto! Have to be very careful of it.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Love this book. Read most of this author's books. They are all great.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Very good tips and easy to read and understand. I rely on this allot.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I have this as my picture printer and its the best one yet. With a great price!!!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Yes its big but VERY useful all the time. I'll buy another.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	It does keep the coffee fresh!! We depend on it. Buy it!! It even looks great.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	This is a product that DOES work. It makes the flavor in the coffee 100% better!!! Get a coffee maker with this filter.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	0	1	I tried this software and every time I tried to burn data to a cd, it always formated the disk for 40-54 minutes. I have Nero home basics, which came with my new DVD burner, and it never tried to format any cd!! I tried the Nero after I got the Roxio. Maybe its me not knowing enough about the software but I uninstalled it.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	It works great. I do love it. But to charge it or sink it to have to take it apart because the bottom opening is to small.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I have large hands and this fits perfect. I bought 4 different type before this one. It works best.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I bought a Wahl first. NOT a good buy. This shaver works great. It's is a little loud but it shaves MUCH better than the Wahl and the Norelco I had. I have NO problem with the noise. I shave every other day because of a sensitive skin and this works great!! Also I'm on heavy blood thinners and can get cut at all. This shaver works best for me.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	0	Its OK but it does put the beard on me once in awhile. But I only save every other day because of such sensitive skin on my neck. This does do the job very well and I do depend on it and like it.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I needed this because I am just starting out. Great for reference and LOTS of tips and examples. Get it.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Got this for my Ipod. I play this on a speaker clock system (inexpensive one) at work and home. Its great as a background playing.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Yes its a little big but it fits the pans. Sturdy ! Long lasting ! NOT cheaply made at all. I now use it allot more than I though I would plus they delivered it faster than I expected.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	I bought a plastic one because I am a beginner at this. This is a very strong box and will last a long time. I use it around the house and yard. Better than $100+ for a power one. I got a Chinese saw, from Amazon, to go with it (back pull) and it works great!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	0	0	Don't know never received it but Amazon did give me my money back. I really want the products!!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	0	0	It worked pretty godd until the reciver fell a short distance to the rug floor and stop working clear reception !Junked it. Never buy again. Bought a better one for $10 more !!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	It works great and I loved it but it sticks out and when you open the window you break it off, or at least I did.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Gave it to my wife and she loves it !!! Now it will be a regular ordered gift!! Try it.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	One of the greatest authors and story's ever written!! I am reading all of his books now that they are in Kindle. It's great to have them all!!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	Finally found it at a reasonable price. Love all the songs and the clarity is fantastic !! Great price and cd !!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	This is one of the best ones we ever bought. We listen to it reading late into the night. We are really glad we bought it !!!!!
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	0	OK. It comes in a cardboard case. BUT the music is wonderful. It's just the dulcimer and is beautiful. I will look for more of this kind. Perfect for relaxing and reading.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	1	1	The best one's so far. I use them on my two Norelco's but the original came apart. Maybe my fault.
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J	0	1	It stained within 6-10 weeks of uses. It's been about three years and now has a crack in the glass. Would not buy or recommend it . Also, it was NOT DROPPED as some may think !! The highest temp was 475 not any higher !!!
A1BQ4NY2EYW97H	0	0	Richard Nixon is probably the most controversial figure in modern american politics. The conventional wisdom is that this very smart man, some say brilliant, was so deeply flawed that he caused his own destruction with a mercilessness that fate reserves for the fallen heros of epic dramas. Given this prevailing opinion, it would seem best to approach this human puzzle through the eyes of a friendly biographer, one who instead of demonizing him, as many have, would try to explain how such a volatile mixture of talent and insecurity would come to test the constitutional limits of the US. Unfortunately, Aitken is not just a friendly author. His adoration --if not worshipping-- of his subject is apparent throughout the book. As an example of Aitken's idolizing, here is how he describes Nixon in his post-Watergate rehabilitation years (p. 564):&quot;Nixon took great care at his dinner parties not to dominate the conversation himself, but he was a powerful conductor of the orchestra, changing the topics, calling the speakers and taking care to bring even the shyest guest into the spotlight. [...]&quot;To be fair, this corny prose is not an accurate reflection of the entire book. And Aitken does make an effort to maintain a distance of objectivity from his subject, though the tendency to offer excuses, rather than insight, is usually transparent. He submits to the accepted verdict that Nixon must be held responsible for Watergate, but for the lesser crime of cover-up. The fact that many of Nixon's close associates ended up in prison does not seem to strike Aitken as odd, as if it's something that happens in every administration...This book packs a lot of information in its nearly 600 pages, covering the period from Nixon's birth to the years before his death. At the end, however, it amounts to little more than an encyclopedia of Nixon trivia. The fire that made the man tick remains unexplored. And that's a pity.
A1BQ4NY2EYW97H	1	1	This is the Dover edition of the 1956 book by Hill on Statistical Mechanics (it was followed by companion book in 1960, also available from Dover). The book is a readable exposition of the foundations and most important results of statistical mechanics. The intended audience is advanced students of statistical mechanics, however, some previous acquaintance with statistical mechanics is recommended. His follow up book,An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics(I've heard it referred to by some as ``baby Hill'') is a better starting point for the first-time student.The book treats a small number of subjects (there are 8 chapters in total) but in detail (this review is based on the chapters I have read so far, 1-4 and 7).The fundamentals are developed in chapters 1-4 which establish the ensembles, first from the classical Gibbs perspective (chapter 1), then from a quantum mechanical point of view (chapter 2). In chapter 3 Hill develops a generalized ensemble from which the microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical follow as special cases. This part ends with the discussion of fluctuations in chapter 4. The remaining four chapters are devoted to general applications: the treatment of imperfect gases and condensation (Mayer's cluster expansion), distribution functions, and lattice statistics.Overall the book is very readable by anyone who has some previous exposition to statistical mechanics and the basic mathematical tricks in working with partition functions. There are some small problems. Chapter 7 (nearest neighbor lattice statistics) is uncharacteristically disorganized and unbalanced with respect to explanations relative to chapter 1-4. Notation is not always helpful. A large number of variables in bold and script letters make the reading of equations a chore. This chore becomes even more laborious by the small type of the book (I estimate that the main font is point size 10 or 9, if not less). Dover would do scientists a huge favor by reissuing the book in larger format.Hill's strength is in not over-explaining things: all mathematical detail is made available to the reader who must then use make use of his/her own brain to make sense of it. For the most part this works well for anyone willing to put the effort (for those who want some guidance in reading about statistical mechanics, an excellent companion is Pathria's book).
A1BQOVFMRJZ677	1	1	I used this book during my senior thesis as one of my main sources. The way it is put together is excellent! Would highly recommend this book to anyone pursuing studies of homosexuality or eugenics in Latin America.
A1BQOVFMRJZ677	1	1	Wow! I was assigned this reading for at class at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs! This book moved me deeply. It is a great and objective account of many during WWII.
A1BQOVFMRJZ677	0	1	This video twists the truth of what happened at New Life Church. It makes a man who lied and cheated look like a hero. I find it odd that it does not address the victims of what Ted did. It only addresses him and his family.
A1BQTWLDSQ78A5	1	1	It would be a travesty to give this band anything less than 5 stars. I'll admit, I was shocked when I popped this into my CD player coming out of the music store. I was expecting something more along the lines of the 2nd disc of 6DOIT, and I was actually a little disappointed with some of the lyrics and James' vocals, and I stress the 'some.' Don't get me wrong, I loooooove his vocals, but there are a few moments where I thought they could have done something better with his voice. But what are they going to do, find another singer? He did amazing on this album, especially on Vacant. I do like him more like on Leonardo the Absolute Man though, and not in heavy metal like this.To be honest, when I first listened to this album I didn't like it, but it's only the second day since its release, and I'm finding more and more that I love about it. If you don't like some of the music in the initial minutes of each song, just make sure you stick around for the fantastic Dream Theater instrumental writing. Endless Sacrifice has some amazing music, and my personal favorite on the album is In The Name Of God. I also love the two-part Vacant and Stream of Consciousness, it reminds me of Wait for Sleep and Learning to Live, off of Images and Words, when they used the same musical theme in both songs.The main thing Dream Theater fans like myself need to understand is that this isn't the music from Images and Words and Awake. DT headed in a much heavier direction with this one, but I gotta say I've never loved metal as much as I have when listening to this album. DT definitely delivered with amazing music, even if it isn't what the 'typical' Dream Theater stuff sounds like.In the end, if you are a true Dream Theater fan, you already have this CD, so it doesn't much matter. And if you are just discovering the virtuosos that are Dream Theater, I hope you like this one as much as I'm beginning to.
A1BQTWLDSQ78A5	0	1	I can't say enough about this movie, I absolutely loved it. But the dvd itself lacks special features of any kind. No commentary, no featurettes, nothing of any kind. I would have loved to be able to hear what the director and stars had to say about this movie, it was definitly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. But I think for now, unless they put out another edition with some kind of special features on it, i would just rent this....a lot. Thats the reason this gets 2 stars, i think a lot of people rate the movie and not the actual item itself.
A1BQY3QN3GJ9S0	0	0	This shipped from Amazon Dec. 19, 2011 and died April 10 2012...that seems a pretty short operating life for a coffee grinder we used mostly once a day, occasionally twice. Looking at the reviews it seems important to take off the hopper and clean it, and I found some dust in there, but not a huge amount. Called the Cuisinart warranty line at 6 ET and was told the systems are being upgraded and I have to call back tomorrow. Not exactly stellar customer service. Worked fine during its very short life.
A1BQY3QN3GJ9S0	1	1	Conversations with PicassoI knew Brassai was a great photographer of Paris at night but I had no idea he was really well educated about literature and art, painted and drew, and met with Picasso as an equal discussing both their art works, art history, styles in painting as Brassai photographed Picasso's paintings and sculptures. This book is just like hanging out with the two of them, before, during and after WWII -- a really fun time with two very smart guys -- the book will send you to the internet looking for some of the artists they are talking about, like Hokusai, a Japanese painter I had never heard of -- Brassai told Picasso he had done some very large paintings, which was news to Picasso. Relaxed and fascinating reading.
A1BRHQQ9G1RNRW	1	1	I've had this unique video tape for years. But now I gave up my VHS player for a Blu-ray player.Why don't they convert Colors of Infinity to Blu-ray or at least make a DVD version? The moving fractal images that are shown are just beautiful along with a great soundtrack. Arthur C. Clarke and Benoit Mandelbrot do an excellent job explaining fractal geometry as do other experts. This video would look beautiful in HD and breathtaking in Blu-Ray.

I can get organic steel cutoats from any health food store in bulk in Los Angeles by Fedex for a fraction of your price or almostanywhere in the country. A consumer can buy it organic for much less without the fancy designed can. And without the chemicals.
A1BRHQQ9G1RNRW	1	1	I read Conversations with God and in Book 3, God states that he inspired this book. I bought it and couldn't put it down, it was so meaningful. Hartmann wisely avoids talking about political solutions and recommends that we change our world perspective, one of the most difficult things to do yet the most important place to start. Although the title seems negative, Hartmann ends it on an optimistic note.One of the most important books on saving the planet that you'll ever read. Share it with everyone you know or better yet buy more copies and give them to your family and friends.
A1BRHQQ9G1RNRW	0	0	This 2 CD set was very disappointing to me. The album is subtitled: The Essential Chopin Collection. If this was the essential Chopin, I wouldn't be listening to his music at all. Considering that most of the pianists were first rate, I expected a much broader selection. To my ear, they were mostly the sweeter, more popular pieces, appealing to more conservative tastes. Granted that they were lovely pieces, they didn't demonstrate the breadth of Chopin's unique musical genius. I was expecting his more fascinating and adventurous works as heard in many of the Etudes, Preludes and Nocturnes. I'll look more carefully next time.
A1BRHQQ9G1RNRW	1	1	When I was a teenager in the 50s, I lived across the street from the Coronet Theater where these films were being shown. (I once read that Chaplin had acting classes at the Coronet in the thirties.) I was used to the usual Hollywood formula films. However, when I started watching these experimental films, it opened up a new world of imagination for me. I'm so happy that this DVD was created showing these most original films which I find still fresh and original over fifty years later.
A1BRHQQ9G1RNRW	0	0	This is a terrible interpretation of a great ballet. If I had known how poor it was, I would never have purchased it.The choreographer was trying to make it hip and modern. Towards the beginning he has Daphnis fall to the floor and you can hear laughter from the audience. Later on, a dancer whizzes through a scene on a skateboard!! If you love this ballet as I do, do NOT buy this travesty of a ballet.
A1BRIYY61WA4A5	1	1	This book is good. My mom said to give the book about 100 pages before seeing if it's good or not. I did and it turned out to be.. pretty good!
A1BROUQF9XAOM7	1	1	After Bon Jovi's previous mediocrity with &quot;Crush,&quot; I was expecting their career to go downhill from there. This album is a VERY pleasant and unexpected surprise. It's enjoyable from start to finish without even one song that has to be skipped. There aren't any songs that will blow you away like &quot;livin' on a prayer&quot; or &quot;Runaway&quot; but it's an enjoyable album nontheless. It's NOT the Bon Jovi from &quot;Slippery When Wet,&quot; but it's definately worth your time and money! Bon Jovi hasn't lost it and can still rock ALMOST as heavy as they once did.

The ease of use and noise-canceling feature makes this unit almost perfect and still deserving of a five star rating. Good thing for me that as technology marches on, prices drop. I paid almost eighty dollars for my first one. Today, I'm getting the same thing here on Amazon for less than half that amount. Don't waste time looking elsewhere for a better price. I just wasted a full hour-plus comparing prices and as of right now, the best price WITH FREE SHIPPING is on Amazon. Way to go guys!! B T W - I do NOT work for Amazon or Plantronics. Just another average Joe like the rest of you trying to help save some time. Thanks again Amazon Dot Com.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	0	0	Like many others, I just cannot recommend this printer or any other Brother product. This is the second product from this manufacturer that I have owned. The first gave me multiple problems, even the second and third replacement units. That was many years ago and I had mostly forgotten the bad taste BROTHER left in my mouth. So when I saw this on sale at a great price, I couldn't resist.BIG MISTAKE! This thing started wrinkling copies almost from the start. When I went to take it back, I was told I bought it during the store's "Bargains with NO RETURN" sale. True but I gave it a try. I'll also never shop there again, mostly because they're out of business. (Imagine that-a store with terrible customer service out of business!) I have not had the same luck as others who claim to have solved the "unable to print an envelope" issue. My HP printer, and everyone of my previous 6 HP printers, printed envelopes without a whimper.My Advice? Steer clear from Brother printers. They just don't get it. I don't think they ever will. From other comments here, it looks like Brother has answered consumer complaints with what I call the single-finger response. In other words, "If you don't like our product, tough. Go somewhere else."
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	0	FIRST-this product DOES NOT WORK sitting down. You must be standing or there will be a mess to clean up. These things really work. The description is 100% accurate. I take a water pill, so when I'm traveling, the urge to urinate can come with about a 5 minute warning (or less). Some men who are "well endowed" may be able to use it sitting down but by standing during use, the abdominal pressure is eased, allowing a smooth, free flow. The on-line research I have done indicates using this item in public, like behind the open car door in a parking lot, is technically Public Urination. However, since you're "keeping it to yourself" and not leaving it behind, that fact alone gives some weight to this act NOT being against the law. SO-just remember to find a secluded place and don't take too long. My suggestion is that everyone carry at least one or two of these in their vehicle for that emergency where it's this or the ground. This item is for LIQUID only. There is a different (similar) product for solid waste. For a very small investment, these are really worth having on hand JUST IN CASE!The review and opinions above are ONLY OPINIONS and should not be construed to be statements of legal opinion or fact. Reviews such as this only refer to my personal experience with the product and it's fulfillment of my expectations.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	1	For those who complain about these socks falling apart, SUGGESTION: Make sure you do regular maintenance on your feet. That includes clipping toenails and buffing smooth all those areas of rough skin, like calluses, corns and bunions. Keeping sharp and rough skin away from the hose will ensure they last a long time. Also, hand wash in warm water with a small amount of mild detergent and then hand rinse in same temp water. Squeeze out excess moisture (wrap in a hand towel and twist the towel) and allow to air dry or hang over the sides of your TV to dry.I've had four pairs of these for about 6 months and wear them every day. Yes, I have to wash them every week but it's worth it.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	0	0	Cheap and cheesy is about the only way to sum up my experience. Although the seat portion is almost wide enough for me, the overall length is sorely lacking. The five pound test fishing line holding it together really says ZERO about the quality. This didn't even come close to fitting in my seat-the upper section didn't reach to the headrest, making it functionally useless.Look elsewhere and be sure to measure your seat before purchasing a product like this.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	1	I purchased this set about 5 years ago and, in spite of it being expensive IMHO, I have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and overall problem-free operation. In fact, except for the batteries now only holding charge for about 5 days, I have had no issues with it. Another thing I like is the handsets are just about the right size, at least for someone with small hands like mine. Not too big or small.Entering phone book entries was a little tedious but this tedium was balanced by being able to copy entries to the second phone at the simple push of a button, thereby eliminating the need to do it twice. Someone was thinking on this feature.My use was confined mostly to inside the house and in the garage on occasion and I experienced no signal drop or garbled conversations. In spite of what the manual says, I believe it is impractical to expect the device to operate properly over the length of a football field-just my opinion.My only complaint, now that I am getting rid of my land line and selling this unit, is deleting the entries. Instead of having a "Delete all entries" feature, they have to be deleted one-by-one-and you have to do the same thing on each phone. Someone was definitely not thinking about this one. That is why I gave it 4 stars. I would still recommend it.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	1	I read all the reviews before ordering two of these. For six bucks, you can't go wrong. NOW I get the joke of other reviewers who said such things as "Is this a toy?" This itsy-bitsy pan really will cook one egg but don't expect it to do anything else. It really is just big enough for one egg. I cooked mine with a slice of cheese on top during the final minute and there was barely room for the cheese. I gave one to my son & DIL but don't think they'll use it. If you have a few extra bucks, order the cute little turner/spatula with the eggie face. This thing is the perfect size for your One-Egg-Wonder pan. It's also cheap enough to throw away if you happen to ruin it by overheating. I gave it 4 stars, not due to any issue but that fifth star is reserved for really outstanding products.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	0	These are really cute and silly but also functional. They're cheap enough to just toss if something extreme, like high heat, happens to them. They are very small so don't expect anything like you've ever seen before.
A1BRP7WDRENDGE	1	1	Anyone who doesn't spend a few bucks for frig & freezer themos is simply asking for trouble. That was me, until about 20 years ago when I noticed my freezer not quite as cold as I remembered. Dismissing this absurd notion, I went off for a weekend vacation and came home to all spoiled food. Never again. The freezer should be kept between -10 to -15 on the coldest end and 0 to +5 on the upper side. Anything above this and trouble is on the way, despite common knowledge that freezing is 32 degrees. If the freezer gets that high, food has already started thawing. The frig should be in a range of 35 to 42 degrees, not cold enough to freeze but just right to keep milk virtually ice cold for drinking. Once or twice a year switch the units, putting the frig unit in the freezer and vice versa, taking note of the reading on each. This is a good way to double check the accuracy of each, costing you exactly ZERO.I highly recommend these and have given them the rare and coveted five stars. Buy them and use them-you won't be sorry.
A1BRXBUFK9DN0M	0	0	Got this gem from a local store a few months ago. The HD output never worked (Y, Cb, Cr). Slow response and loud. Do not buy anything from jWin. You get what you paid for. Save your time and eyes and get a Sony.
A1BRXBUFK9DN0M	0	0	Received this gem today from UPS. Right from the start the progressive scan outputs do not work. The output appears to be missing the red. My connections are double checked. This unit is defective. I have 2 SONY dvd players that worked flawlessly for many years. No more Philips for me...ever. It a great price at ~$40 but not such a good deal if it is a piece of junk. Save your return time and headache and just get something else.
A1BRXBUFK9DN0M	0	0	I had this for 6 month and was pretty pleased with it. Then the hinge broke making this into an expensive regular open-top trash can. Replacing the top assembly is an expensive option to repair this. I will just pick up a 'normal' foot operated trash can next time.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	0	1	Quite simply, if you liked Texas first 3 CD's, you'll likely hate this Motown-retro sounding album unless you just love everything Spiteri does. Upon this release, they have abandoned everything that made them a quality and interesting band. The cut "Summer Son" is a catchy little number---don't let anyone know I said that though.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	I have the first 5 Texas CD's so that provides me with a wide spectrum of exposure to this band and this, by far, is the best album they've ever done or will ever do. However, their is a caveat: I believe Texas is MUCH better at alternative, soulful country music than the soulless pop they found success overseas with which, after their 3rd album, they focused on. So, if you like "The Hush", "White on Blonde" and subsequent follow ups, this review won't likely mean much to you. If you didn't like those albums, but like the genre I described---read on. In what they failed to do with their first album "Texas", they NAILED on this album. Great song writing that showcases Spiteri's vocals, great slide guitar, keyboards and often atmospheric interplay. Every song is good and ends with an amazing "Walk The Dust" which is the song Texas was meant to write and play. In my collection 400 to 500 CD's this is one of the best. It's original, genre bending, well produced, and truly a great effort. It's too bad they didn't get the commercial support they needed to stay on this road.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	I remember purchasing "Spirit of Love" back in the 90's and making a point to monitor everything that Fashek does. He is every bit an African musician, but has been heavily influenced by Bob Marley and brings an American edge to some of the numbers as well (perhaps the producing by Miami Steve Van Zandt on Spirit of Love rubbed off a bit). If you like westernized African music or a classic reggae album with a bit more variety than you are used to, then this is a great album. This ranks right up there with the best of Majek Fashek, IMO.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	Transcedental Blues was a comeback album for Steve Earle. On the verge of death from drug addiction in the mid-90's, it took Earle a few years to get back on the saddle, but once he did, he used the various mental state experiences to produce one of his most compelling albums. Purish Earle fans might find it a little experimental, but all the great artists vary their sound here and there and Steve Earle is a great artist. This album gets better with every listen.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	Conjure One's first effort quite often resembles the best of late Delerium, but with some World Music influences combined to make a tantalizing first album. As was the case for the more clubby, Delerium material like Poem, Semantic Spaces and Karma, great vocals animate synthesizers and back beats to produce a virtually "listen to under any circumstances" type of CD. Actually, it's hard to imagine them improving on this one. Fans of mid to late Delerium, Enigma, and Madonn'a "Ray of Light" will not be disappointed here.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	As a recent fan of Powderfinger, I'm able to examine all their music basically at the end of the band's days since they just announced their farewell tour. While Parables for Wooden Ears and Double Allergic were more grunge orientated, Vulture Street improves on where Odyssey Number Five left off. The album is an ode to straight ahead, 70's Rock N Roll and perhaps borrows nuances from great classic rockers, but hey, that's what the band was after. There's no need to do a song by song summary. Like any album, there are a couple songs that are a little lesser, but by and large, this is their best work. Plain and simple, it rocks and if they had any following here in the states, this album might go down as one of the best rock albums EVER! It is in my book.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	One could argue whether this album is better than Vulture Street, but I still can't concede that. What it does offer is a quantum leap from previous work in melodic groove, song writing, and a heightened maturity of the band in almost every facet. The grungers will say it's too mainstream, but it wasn't really meant for them---as most of the Fingers work wasn't either. This is the album that sends Powderfinger in the direction they ultimately wanted to go. There are CLASSIC songs here "Waiting For The Sun", "My Happiness", "Up & Down & Back Again, "My Kind of Scene, "We Should Be Together Now, etc. This is a must buy if you're just tapping into Powderfinger. You won't be sorry.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	0	While Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street delivered on the promise of this band, this album marks the downward direction of their creative energy which is not to say it's a bad album. It's simply a reflection of the members maturing and, if I can say, losing some of their angst. At this point, they are probably the biggest band in Australia and with that standing they take on various ballads that have social conscious as well as self therapy (for Bernard Fanning anyway). That said, there are a number of good songs and if you are looking to build your Powderfinger collection, it's a must have. I would rank it their 3rd best album and, in a way, it makes Golden Rule---their next and last album, a bit obsolete.
A1BS30CHZ1D3IO	1	1	I remember reading this book as a kid. Not only did it expose me to cards and players I never heard of----which was really cool, but I marveled at the style of writing. There were sharp, witty observations and some great humor. To this day, I believe it has left an indelible mark on my own sense of writing style. If you're a fan of baseball, you should probably get it. If you are a baseball card fan, collector or reminicer, it is a must have possession!!!
A1BS46S5W66SEB	1	1	After purchasing and trying the 'low end' steamers, I took a big leap and bought the Reliable T630. If you search the net, you'll see all sorts of 'high end' models available. The fact that amazon carries this model was also a part of my decision in getting this unit.The good:The steamer/vapor machine is awesome. I have cleaned all sorts of things around the kitchen ranging from tile/grout on the floor, tiled counter tops, stovetops, sinks, around the faucets and bathrooms. So far, the machine has lived upto (and beyond) the expections. Funny, how the 'expecations' change when you see a product that actually works. I tried the cheaply made 'SteamFast' and a couple of the 'bottle' style steamers. None of the low end units did the job. If you don't try the better unit, you'll never know what you are missing. I thought the SteamFast was as good as it was going to get till I finally decided to get the Reliable T630, which is quite a cost jump from $100 to $400. For me, the investment is worth it given what the other devices couldn't do and what the Reliable T630 does, and does it very well. The unit has a large tank so you won't be refilling it every 10 mins. That being said, it all comes down to what your applications are. For example, if you have a very large kitchen, then I can see the need to refill again. The wait for the heating time can take easily upto 15 mins. So what !! Plug it in, turn it on and start doing other stuff while you wait. Its NOT that big of a deal. Tip: If you want less waiting time, use hot water ;-).The issues:No machine is fault-free. This machine has its own share. To add to what already has been written for this unit...the AC Cord is short. To fix that, simply go to Home Depot and buy an extension. The maker of this appliance is in Canada. That almost was a deal breaker for me. I can't see myself spending $$$ for shipping (both ways) if this unit fails - BUT - given the performance I've seen, for me, it is still worth it. The owners manual is terrible but it doesn't require a rocket scientist degree to figure it out either. Hopefully, the company will re-write it and put it on their website. If you search the internet, you'll find the manual so you can download it beforehand and decide for yourself...and if you still don't get it, just write an email to the company if you have any questions. Nuff' said regarding the manual ;-). The steam/vapor trigger is very touchy/sensitive so you'll get use to that. I notice the "power on" round knob is rather flimsy. I can see that breaking off if not careful. I was very surprised to see the 'cheapness' from this costly machine. So, I'd recommend to use extra caution when turning the machine on and rotating the knob.I'll try to remember to update my post after I've used it for 90 days. When I was searching for a good steamer/vapor cleaner, it was difficult to find candid reviews. This is not a dime-a-dozen item found at walmart or target etc. Hopefully, my review will help someone who is on the fence, trying to make a decision towards one of these units.Accessories for this unit seem sturdy and seem to work as expected. To buy replacement brushes etc, take a look at eurosteam dot com. They are very reasonable and offer a great selection. I couldn't find the accessories cheaper anywhere else. If you need more towels etc, head to your local automotive store or costco, you'll get more bang for your buck buying them at costco. When using the Reliable T630, you'll definitely go through a lot of towels but that's a good thing, right? Your house/dwelling will be a lot cleaner.Lastly, get the Reliable T630 here at Amazon. As of Jan 8, 2009, it is $100 cheaper when comparing the other website
A1BS46S5W66SEB	1	1	I purchased this pan to make loaf cakes and breads. It is very sturdy and has a thick non-stick coating on it - giving it a solid feel. During my last visit at target, I check what they stocked, and in comparing, for the price, this pan is far superior to what they stock. Amazon's price is excellent.So far, I baked a beer batter cheese bread in it. The bread baked to perfection. I will be purchasing another pan very soon so I can make two breads at a time.This product is highly recommended.
A1BS46S5W66SEB	1	1	I have been using this radio for the past two weeks - mostly when working in the garage and in the backyard. The reception is great on FM. I'm not much of AM listner so can't say much about it.I like the ruggedness and it has a nice 'heft' to it. I have been using it on household AC so far. Eventually, as the need arises, I'll use the AUX input as well as other available options.The **ONLY** concern I have about this radio, as it has been stated in several pervious reviews - is the 'boominess' audio.Too bad there is no way to control that. I have electronics background from my past career so I will google and see if there are options to install an inline filter capacitor to the speaker that will cut the low end audio frequency.Other than that, all is good. My previous garage radio was a beat-up cassette boombox, which served its purpose for the past 20+ years. Hopefully, this radio will last another 20 years for me :)Oh, the neighbors got a kick out of this radio's shape, they all thought it was a power generator.I have deducted one star due to boominess of the audio.
A1BS5KP63Z9N66	1	0	Around pp. 165-167, in the essay "The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction," LeGuin discusses the possibility that the first human invention was not the weapon, but the container -- the sling, the sack, the bag, the carrier. (I remembered it as "the vessel," but that term doesn't appear in the book.) What good is generating a lot of stuff to eat if you don't have any way to get it back to camp? She argues the point persuasively and passionately.I read this book in 1991 or 1992, nearly 20 years ago. I've not seen the idea anywhere else (although she cites an anthropologist writing in 1975) but it has shaped my perception since. Not to diminish the rest of the book, but this single idea in this one essay is, I believe, worth getting the whole book for.
A1BSBR1K26GHG1	1	1	I love this group and this CD does not disappoint. A unique mix of selections enhanced, as always, by the outstanding musical talent of the group.
A1BSBR1K26GHG1	1	1	A great group with loads of talent. The groups spirit and enthusiasm has not diminished with age. The CD contains a very interesting mix of selections.
A1BSE0I6HWY9H8	1	1	I recognize that this is not intended to be anything more than entertainment, therefore, I enjoy it. It is bloodily gruesome, profane and gratuitous (sexuality and nudity), however, the folks at STARZ are attempting to depict the way life was prior to the collapse of the Roman Empire. Historically speaking, that period was not for the moral or the squeamish. I think that this show may be overblown, but the acting is solid, the action sequences are fun and the story is entertaining. Go into it with a tongue firmly planted in your cheek and you may enjoy this show.
A1BSE0I6HWY9H8	0	0	It is not a film i'd watch again. I realize that it is a horror spoof, but I didn't find anything funny about it. The premise is decent enough and the acting was fine, I just didn't think it was humorous in any way shape or form.
A1BSE0I6HWY9H8	0	0	This film stars several talented actors, yet the result is plain awful. Hated it from the first minute until the end. I do not recommend for those who really want to laugh because you will be disappointed.
A1BSK1A2ZXG31V	0	1	Curious in control Smells like cheap deodorant spray. I would suggest The original "Curious" which has a soft pleasant scent, but this one is far from it. Its like a mix of fruit punch,and plastic......just not appealing.
A1BSK1A2ZXG31V	0	0	I took a chance and purchased "Design" by Paul Sebastian because of the glowing reviews. I was told by someone that it reminded them of an old lady in church. I found it kinda strong, and I agree it has an old fashioned thing going on.I guess thats due to the warm musky notes.
A1BSK1A2ZXG31V	1	1	I love this glossing cream;a little goes a long way.You'll only need a dime size amount to do the trick. Not only does it make my hair silky and smooth but it smells really nice. If you're tired of dry(unhealthy)or dull hair.... you should add some life and shine to it with this cream.
A1BSUXVZ4OEAYA	0	0	I returned my thermos because it was damaged. However, the mouth of the thermos is so small that you can't fit ice cubes through the mouth to turn you room temperature water into cold water. I am baffled as to why they would design it knowing perfectly well that people would want to put ice cubes into the bottle.
A1BSUXVZ4OEAYA	1	0	This product deserves the 5 stars I am giving it. It's too bad that so many of you rated it with such low scores because of your lack of understanding of what this product is intended for and how to use it PROPERLY. Your fuses are all being blown because the compressor draws more current than what your fuses are rated for. Don't blame the compressor! A typical cigarette lighter won't work for most cars. You need to plug into the accessory port now found on most newer cars. And so many of you are expecting it to blow up large tires or other objects in seconds. That is not what this compressor was designed for. It is basically for emergency situations. It is compact and portable so that you can keep it in the trunk of your car. If you want to blow your flat tire up in less than a minute then spend thousands of dollars and buy a compressor like those found at gas stations. Have fun powering it and trying to keep it in the trunk of your car though. Learn about the product you are buying before you buy it. Don't bad mouth it because you bought something and didn't use it the way it was designed to be used. Geez. You have given this product a much lower score than it deserves because you didn't do your homework and now the manufacturer suffers because of your poor ratings. (No, I don't work for or know of anyone who works for this company.)
A1BT30JKJTEAAX	1	1	I bought this card to go with my Canon Powershot SX20 IS. I was planning on going to a U2 concert and wanted to have plenty of storage. I actually bought two if them. It worked great. It took about 20 GB to get the entire concert. No problems with the card and it works in both my PC and laptop without the provided USB attachment. See the results at: [...].
A1BT30JKJTEAAX	1	1	Really enjoyed it and hope they make the rest of the book into a movie soon. I would by a sequel
A1BT8HI8Z8XX8Y	1	1	There's no real problems with the album, and each song is distinct, so it's overall a good mixtape. However, no songs really stand out as incredible, none you find yourself singing along to in the car. If you want some unique and good rap to listen ot in the background, this is it, as it beats 90% other albums out there.
A1BT8HI8Z8XX8Y	1	1	Nimzowitsch was not only a great player, but an excellent analyst as well as an excellent teacher, able to explain things in a simple and clear manner, then follow them up with examples and a handful of games. Another great part about the book is that almost everybody can learn something from it, excluding lower level beginners. I give it a five for completeness, although "The Art of Attack" is another great choice if you want to learn more dynamic play.
A1BT8HI8Z8XX8Y	1	1	It's kind of ridiculous how incredible this album is and how it's gotten very little play and hype compared to D4L or Mistah Fab. They made no chart-topping hits, but I guarantee every song is good.
A1BT8HI8Z8XX8Y	1	1	Works well, has a nice wood finish and has a great price. Perfect if it's going to be your first, you need a bit of extra space from another humidor, or you're giving it as a gift
A1BT8HI8Z8XX8Y	1	1	My fiancee is pretty athletic but said she wanted to get into "perfect wedding shape."She tried this from the library and went the hardest mode to start thinking she'd have no problem. Seeing her after, it seems pretty difficult! She likes the conditioning and variety of the workout. This is also one of the few workout tapes that she actually purchased; most she will rent from the library and use once.She loves it so I guess I do, too!
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	Lovely writing and the illustrations are enchanting! I've gotten this for every grandchild, and wish I had discovered it earlier...
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	A lone prospector named Burl Fleming rescues a beautiful little girl from Indians and raises her as his daughter; then captured by bandits, brutal as only Ware can make them, the classic Western test of courage, loyalty, love, and survival begins.Clyde Ware could have been the greatest of them all. His knowledge of the power in words and his direct, lean prose consistently delivers gut punches. This is not a glorification of the Old West. This is a powerful, real writer, totally at home in the classic American Western Genre. More at home in the American Western, imo, than anyone other than Zane Grey, Ware was better known for his scripts for Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and Rawhide than his pitifully small collection of books. Literature's loss was Hollywood's gain.
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	No Drums No Bugles is done in the avant garde style of the 60s, so don't be expecting a fast-paced Civil War movie. That said, Clyde Ware, who wrote, directed and produced this was one of the artistic giants of the 20th century. Filmed in Doddridge County, WV, Ware's boyhood home, the scenery / photography is breathtaking. Ware cast an unknown, Martin Sheen, as the lead (a conscientious objector. I found it thoroughly enjoyable.
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and it is a great addition to any home library. (That's my criteria - no point in buying a movie if seeing it once is enough&lt;G>)The love story is genuine, the music is great, and the dancing is out of this world!Also captures the times of the 'Borscht Circuit' hotels in the Catskills much as 'Marjorie Morningstar' did.
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	Great value - this set includes many hours of Robin Hood adventures. Some I'd forgotten - some I would swear I never saw originally. Good acting and directing - the set and photography just as good as I remembered.
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	Well-done movie and a sympathetic look at 'behind the scenes' Queen Victoria and her reign. This one is a 'keeper' for me. Worth a few viewings.
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	1	1	Who am I to review Patsy Cline??? Excellent choice of songs. Good quality recording. (And it says I need this many more words? LOL)
A1BTCGVQDH2F3C	0	1	This was not the best book for a reference. I would like something that shows musculature and how exercises affect it.
A1BTJJMWNQRLXZ	1	1	My granddaughter loved it. She is totally infatuated with it. Beautiful in the 3D I would reccommend it to everyone
A1BTPAG3SASZBJ	1	1	My 2-year old received this book as a Christmas gift, and he LOVES it. I like the fact that it not only has cartoon-ish pictures of animals, but realistic ones as well. My child is experiencing a developmental delay, and I worry that he gets confused with what a real animal looks like, versus the animated versions of them that he usually sees. The textures are also very good, and my son enjoys feeling the rough, soft, and furry animals.
A1BTPAG3SASZBJ	1	1	I bought this book for my 5 year old daughter, and I think she's read it about 7 times! Thanks to her parents, she has an affinity for the spooky side of life, and she loves how Franny likes creepy stuff, but is still a very smart, creative girl...just like my daughter. I would highly recommend Franny K. Stein!
A1BTPAG3SASZBJ	1	1	My 6-year old daughter purchased this with a gift card she received for her birthday, and she and her 3-year old brother absolutely love it! It's one of the few things that they enjoy playing TOGETHER. We haven't had the problem with it that others mentioned with the "finger trap". So far it's worked really well, and it was a great buy (...)
A1BTPAG3SASZBJ	0	0	I was looking forward to this movie, as my husband and I love films with werewolves, vampires, zombies...etc. Neither of us had ever read the books, so we didn't know much about the story line. It was truly one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. We saw it in the theater, and we almost walked out about halfway through, but decided to stick it out to the bitter end. It's worse than a soap opera...there's nothing wrong with a little romance in a horror film, but this was just insipid.
A1BTRH2UA97NAK	0	0	Well I guess you can't always go by the first few reviews. This was almost the worst zombie movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, Terrible sound, and camera work. Whats up with the extreme closeups, and hand held camera? The only redeeming quality to this film is the soundtrack, if you like country blues. And the nostalgic drive in movie clips. Besides that, Sorry this movie is a no go. Don't get me wrong I like all types of zombie movies, and try to give them all a chance, but this one... just didn't deserve the one star that I gave it, and definitely not the 5 stars the other folks gave it. Thats my story, and I'm stickin' to it.
A1BTRH2UA97NAK	1	1	Movie was very Well done. Great acting, Great Cinematography, Great effects. Very believable alien flick, and when I say that, I mean not to far fetched. Did the Job of entertaining me, and thats all I really ask, of a film, is to be entertained.
A1BTRH2UA97NAK	1	1	This is a great replacement for canned air, or at least thats why I purchased it. It has a very powerfull little motor, and is compact. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is that it is super loud, as loud as an upright vaccum cleaner. Besides that, everything works great.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Having read several of Barnes' other novels I was excited about this alternative history/ universe novel. It is *not* a satire as some reviewers have called it. Like the good speculative fiction it is, it takes its setting seriously, to tell a fascinating story. One reviewer suggested it will be taught in high school and college classrooms in 20 years. It's not farfetched: I could see my students loving this. If it were shorter, I'd teach it next year. I prefer it to Octavia Butler's sf slave novel Kindred.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	This book reminds me of Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ and Octavia Butler's _Wild Seed._ (This is very high praise, in case you didn't know.) None of these are hard sf -- if that's what you want read Arthur C. Clarke instead. They are mythic fiction, speculative fiction, horror, literature, historical fiction, urban fantasy, who cares what the genre is called? (Hint: no star ships here.) What Butler, Morrison and Barnes have in common is that their characters during slave times must make truly *terrible* choices to preserve their families. In the present Derek Waites, Austin Tucker and Dahlia Washington have to make similar bargains to keep their families intact. I have read Barnes' earlier work which is (for me) too reliant on physical violence. This book which has the thoughtful Derek and the kinesthetic Tucker is much more enjoyable. In fact, I couldn't put it down. That the backdrop for the story in the present is the Rodney King riots is visceral.So-- when will Smith and Pinkett make this as a movie?!!!
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	This neat novel is told from the point of view of view of Scarlett O'Hara's half sister. Cynara is Mammy and Scarlett's Dad's daughter. She's given to another family when she's 13, but winds up working as a maid at Belle Watling's, where she meets Rhett Butler. She becomes his mistress until Scarlett's death when they marry.It's called a parody, but it's not. It's a retelling of a fundamentally American story that needed to be retold. I read retellings of fairy tales as fantasy adult books like McKinley's _Deerskin_ and Yolen's _Briar Rose._ Those folktales don't have lots of fans who complain about the changes Yolen made to Sleeping Beauty. I'm glad I read GWTW many, many years ago. Margaret Mitchell's estate sued over this book, it was silly of them to do, but I'm glad they did. Otherwise I may not have heard of this book. I'm very glad I found it.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I had forgotten that in the last New Frontier book Mark McHenry and Morgan Primus die. Only in this book we find they did not. He is in stasis, young Moke can see him, and McHenry speaks often to Wotan. Morgan has become the computer. The Beings, Gods from old Earth are still offering ambrosia and eternal life in exchange for being worshipped and killing those who cross them. Ambassador Spock makes an appearance on a Romulan Bird of Paradise, basically so he can humorously compare Calhoun's and Kirk's styles as captains... Only Mac and Shelby's ships are able to beat them because they don't fear them. Wotan traps them in black hole and McHenry becomes visible long enough to tell the crew goodbye, it's now his job to watch the black hole so they don't escape. And Kebron has changed. Oh yeah, Wotan is Moke's biological father. And Gleau is discovered dead in the last sentence.In all, it was too similar to Gaiman's _American Gods_ for my tastes. Any New Frontier book is welcome, devoured, especially in ppbk, but when it's this similar it loses some savor. (But if you're as into the series as I am, you *have* to read each one!)
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Sookie Stackhouse's adventures in northern Louisiana as the telepathic girlfriend of a vampire left me slightly flat in this novel. I like her because she's so very different from Anita Blake and other vampire books: she's small town southern, a barmaid, ***normal***, except when she's not.But to my taste this novel gives her too many similarities to Anita Blake. Bill, her vampire boyfriend, betrays her, Bill's sexy vampire boss makes a play for her, as does a handsome and wealthy werewolf. Her response to all these men is also similar to Anita's. I like the humor, the sense of place, the surprises of these books. After six or eight of these books I may just get tired of Sookie if she continues her Anita Blake reflection.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	For me, it's been over two years since I originally read _Avatar_ Books 1 &amp; 2, so after reading _The Lost Era: the Art of the Impossible_ by Keith DeCandido which prominantly features a younger Elias Vaughn I re-read the Avatar books. Then I read Mission Gamma. I'm glad I did it that way. This is a very rich novel on the characterization side and I needed that scorecard.This novel has a great cast of characters with fascinating desires and motives! Vaughn wants to explore the Gamma quadrant to expiate some of the horrible things he's done in his long career. His daughter Prynn is the pilot and wants her father to leave her alone. Andorian science officer Shar wants to be left alone by his mother, but knows he's hurting his bondmates by being in the Gamma quadrant and in Star Fleet. Kira wants to get through her religious expulsion and to figure out what's up with the diplomats on the station. Ro wants to be able to be a good Security Chief for the station and have some fun with Quark. Quark wants to make money, but he's also very interested in Ro. Trier is Orion Girl hired by Quark as a dabo girl who wants to be more. Kasidy wants to be left alone on Bajor while she waits for the baby to be born, Jake to stop being missing and Sisko to come home. Dax is XO of the Defiant and she and Julian have issues with their relationship because of her new job. I've ordered the next books in the series, I hope they come *soon* and that I can get _Unity_ at the library.If the rest are anything like this one, I am in for a real treat!!!
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, I bought this becaue I had read it had an interesting view of sex and gender. It does, in spades, but more I liked it for its religion and caste system, it's politics. It's rare in speculative fiction, especially in fantasy for religion to play such an important part. But Phedre is a Servant of Naamah and Joscelin is a Cassaline Brother, both are serving gods with their oaths as best they can. It is a fascinating world Carey has written and I recommend it wholeheartedly.Love as thou wilt.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	1	I bought this book because of its title, something I never do, I almost always read reviews first. I hope you will. Most here are very positive, mine is not. I haven't been a teenage drama queen in many, many years but I am a Mrs. Baggoli (her drama teacher.) Lola is a grating, unsympathetic heroine: she's at least as self-absorbed as her rival Carla Santini. She's also too smart by half for a 16 year old. I'm sure it'll be a popular movie-- I won't see it, though.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	0	Carey does such an amazing job of world-building that I feel like I've been in Terre d'Ange,(France) La Serenissima, (Venice) Menekhet, (Egypt), Akkadia (Iran, Iraq) and oh yes Drujan (Georgia &amp; Azerbaijan) along with her characters. (And I really, really didn't want to be in Drujan. It's a terrible horrible no good place.) Then they follow the Nile River to Lake Victoria. It's quite a hero's journey Phedre, Joscelin and then Imriel make. And as with hero's journeys, though a lot of land is covered, most of the changes are internal. I'm sorry to have finished this book. I read this long book quickly, without getting much sleep, I had to know what was coming next. I want to read more about these characters. Fortunately, according to the author's website, she is planning a series about Imriel. I wish I could read it ***now.***
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	0	This is a novel for girls who like Pirates of the Caribbean; Nancy and Minerva are at least as exciting as heroes and pirates as the characters played by Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. (And much more interesting than the girl in that movie!) Nancy is a wealthy planter's daughter whose brothers attempt to marry her off to a violent and scary man to pay off their gambling debts. Minerva is her slave - and her friend. They "go on account" with an able and fair captain who rarely kills people. It's very good in the pirate history and a fun read.Someone said a girl of Nancy's social class wouldn't have done turned pirate. But Rees spent 150 pages exploring how little Nancy cared for upper class values and people. It wasn't easy for either girl to become pirate, their situation was truly dire. The class and racial politcs ring as true as the piracy -- the most democratic place in the early 18 century is a pirate ship! Like Witch Child and Sorceress, I hope there will be another book about Nancy and Minerva.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	In the 1840s western New York was known as the Burned- Over District because it was where Smith and the Mormons came from. Where Finney toured the country leading revivals in tents, where Miller prophesied the world would end in 1843, Noyes led a utopian community in Onieda and the Fox sisters heard ghosts "rapping" and began the spiritualist movement. The last four are all plot elements in this novel set in that place and time, rather reminiscent of Coville and Yolen's contemporary Armageddon Summer. The three Charter sisters Vern, Amy and Kate come to the attention of the Rev. Elias Fitcher, and one after the other they marry him. Kate succeeds in rescuing herself, her sisters and most of the people living in Harbinger - when the world ends but only for Fitcher.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Jed is half Tsimshian and half white, his best friend Tadashi is Japanese, but what they both are to themselves is Canadian. But the practices and laws of their country don't agree just before the beginning of Wold War II in remote Prince Rupert Sound on the British Columbia coast. Meanwhile they're working at an army base and nursing a wounded bald eagle back to health. It's an understated, perfect little book, particularly for boys who are interested in action-- and who would appreciate the issues of identity of boys go through.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	"Oaths and miracles are usually followed by deceptive statements." FBI Manual* 30 year old English major/ FBI agent stalks his ex-wife with lovely romantic notes and goofy drawings while trying to connect the dots between the Mafia and a biotech firm.*The widow of a brilliant, philandering, narcissistic geneticist as a only a trained journalist whose father is a retired teacher of Physics and Chemistry and whose hobby is writing a history of the saints. (And they live in Troy, NY.) * A construction worker and ex-Marine who waits to spend to two hours every other week with his kids who live in a religious compound outside Gloversville, NY dedicated to an obscure Celtic saint who may have also been a Franciscan brother hundreds of years later martyred by the Indians.* A former Las Vegas showgirl now attending University of Michigan whose best friend was murdered, as was her mobbed- up boyfriend saying "Cadoc Verico Cadaverico"This novel is a thoroughly likeable combination of FBI thriller and mystery with ten minutes into the future genetics and sf and a bit of religious thought.I thotoughoughly enjoyed Kress' Beggars books and look forward to Stinger, the further adventures of this odd and likeable g-man. (And I hope there's more in the next book about Upstate New York!)
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	0	This book did not work for me *at all*. Perhaps it's that Steven the protagonist is so far from his emotions and feelings and what he wants. He's distant- from everyone and everybody he comes in contact with. Perhaps it's that his antagonist, Christian, his brother, has no reason to be the antagonist. (Then there's the yucky 14-15 y/o heroine, who was no heroine...) Perhaps it's that I've read many, many authors who travel down similar mythic lines and connect with me viscerally as a reader. Joseph Campbell, Neil Gaiman, Chales de Lint, Jane Yolen, Terri Windling all do it so much better, at least for me. In de Lint's newest book, _Widdershins_ Jilly thinks of herself as the Broken Girl. That's a theme in these adventures, the hero (of whatever sex) must be impaired. Steven has just fought a war and has a shrapnel wound, but it's his friend Harry Keeton, a burned flyer who is the damaged one, the one who goes on spite of. Why Steven goes on, I'm just not sure. I am glad for those of you who liked this book that there are further books in this series. I won't be reading them.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Book # 1 of this series is Rowan Hood, about Rowan and her ancillary band to Robin's in the Sherwood Forest. Book # 2 is Lionclaw. Book # 3 is this one about Princess Ettard, a 13 year old who is rescued by Rowan and friends from a marraige to a wealthy landowner. In this, there is more backstory to Etty, we find out more about her parents and why her father is the tyrant king he is. I haven't read Lionclaw, the book about Lionel, yet, but I don't *think* this novel would stand well on its own.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	1	I really enjoy Robert Cormier's novels. I've read several of them and enjoy the Monument, Frenchtown setting particularly of some of them. I also like YA novels in verse, Hesse's "Witness" and Koertge's "Shakespeare Bats Cleanup," for instance, are terrific. Other reviewers here have quoted the first four lines of the book: "That summer in Frenchtown/ in the days/ when I knew my name/ but did not know who I was./ Perhaps I would have liked Eugene's story more a few years later when he did know who he was. This was uninvolving. Cormier's heroes tend to be lonely and loners, observers as Eugene is, but he's so very cut off.I imagine I will *love* the next Cormier novel I read.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Sylvia Lynn is Rois' (from Winter Rose) four times great granddaughter and Lynn Hall has been left to her after the death of her grandfather. She has moved a continent away from Lynn Hall and her grandparents, because like Rois and Corbet she is half- fay. Her grandmother Iris has been the leader of the Fiber Guild, which she describes as a sewing circle, but it's more of a coven about fear -- and good food-- and binding up the rents between this world and the Otherworld.Owen, Sylvia's near -relation thinks:"The heir to Lynn Hall had just walked out of the world into fairyland. The heir to Lynn Hall, born to guard, and watch, and keep all passageways locked againsr the wood- folk, was one of them herself. And one of us.And so was the young man who had stolen my daughter's heart."This is an excellent tale, well worth reading and owning. I liked the varying POV and contemporary setting very much.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	After Val sees her mother and boyfriend together, she leaves her New Jersey home and stays in New York with homeless kids who help out fairies. She doesn't belive that they are fairies at first, but later has to, especially when she becomes addicted to their drugs. As a high school teacher, I don't think I'd teach this book, but I would proudly put it in my classroom library. As some of the kids have said here, this is the kind of language they and their friends use. Sure, if they used it in class I'd have to write them up, but I have taught kids in recovery, for whom this might have meant a great deal."Even though Val had wanted to find evidence of faeries, the actual proof was overwhelming. How many faeries were there and what other things might there be? In a world where faeries were real, might there be demons or vampires or sea monsters? How could these things exist and not be on the front cover of every newspaper everywhere?"This is a terrific book, well worth reading and savoring.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	16-year-old Maggy takes care of her drunken mother, draws at her favorite caf&eacute; and is generally invisible. Until she meets the skwatter (her spelling) Cole and his harem, then she feels alive. When she sees what he's done to the other two girls, she gets herself and attempts to get the others away as well. At first, I thought Cole was a vampire, but no he's a conventional user. "...I look at him once and I can't look away. Like the most perfect picture you ever saw, a walking wish come true: crow- black hair and loose green jacket, tall, even taller than me but when he moves it's not jerky or gawky, just pure grace, like he really belongs in his body, like it's his favorite place to be."_The Blue Mirror_ is well worth reading.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I have been reading Sandra McDonald's fiction for over 11 years. I've read many of her short stories and way back when, in another life, I was the flagwaver for her fanfiction. (Don't ask.) So that I'd love her first novel is no great surprise to me. What do I like about it?The crew of the Aral Sea seems a very realistic portrayal of sailors/ spacefarers. Unlike Star Trek, on McDonald's ship they can't replicate whatever it is they want. When you want a uniform, a machine part or food it is Underway Stores that must store, find and inventory it.The Aral Sea (a nod to the Vorkosigan saga only in my mind-- these ships are named after environmental disasters) is an unhappy ship and Jodenny is assigned the unhappiest department: Underway Stores, but that's where Terry works. She's an officer and he's enlisted, but that doesn't stop the attraction they have for each other. The mystery of why the ship is so very unhappy is part of what Jodenny & Terry must solve-- and that's terrific, and, well, Bujold-like.What I also like is that after ~400 pages, I don't know everything about this universe. Why is nearly everybody Australian -- or their forbearers are? Why are so few characters born on Earth? Why did the aliens give this technology and leave? It means that Sandra has many more stories in this series to tell!Like Bujold's Vorkosigan series in some ways, both are about military & quasi- military ships. Jodenny and Terry would get on very well in the Dendarii Mercenaries. Actually, though, it's more like Tanya Huff's Valor books, with Sergeant Torin Kerr. I'm sure Kerr'd like Terry, but Jodenny... (Kerr, like Terry is enlisted and spends much of her time protecting officers. Unlike Terry, Torin is a warrior.)Unlike Star Trek and unlike the Vorkosigan series, this isn't about feats of derring do and military prowess. It's about the guys in the red shirts that make the ship go and whose names we never hear. People who are just as courageous, in their way, as Captain Kirk and Miles Vorkosigan, maybe moreso."I saw something," Jodenny whispered.Neither of them moved to investigate. Being in Team Space had never demanded much bravery, Myell knew. It required endurance of petty annoyances and mammoth wastes of time, and the discipline of listening to superiors talk of nonsense and trivia, and the ability to think one way and act another, for days and months and years at a time. He had been truly scared only a few times in his military career-- once while doing firefighting training in boot camp, another when Chiba's men entereted his Security cell duing the Ford affair - but all in all, he could safely say he had never been asked to chase something down in the icy darkness, something only his lieutenant thought she saw."There's nothing there," he said.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	If you've already read this and are looking for similar books, I fear you'll be disappointed. Hoffman's novels are quite unique. That said, read the rest of her books, especially Past the Size of Dreaming and Stir of Bones. These are also about Matt and Edmund. Brother to Dragons, Companion to Owls by Jane Lindskold, many stories & novels by Charles de Lint, say The Ivory and the Horn or Trader, the anthology The Armless Maiden ed. by Terri Windling who also wrote The Woodwife, a novel. Like Hoffman, these are urban fantasies. Where magic and faerie exists alongside McDonald's and malls and homeless people.Matt (who is a woman, but since she's homeless she dresses and presents as a man) and Edmund have magic that most people can't see. Edmund calls his Spirit. Is that the Holy Spirit? Maybe. They don't say. Do other people think they're mentally ill? Matt's spent some time in hospitals. They're warm and serve meals, but since she can ask trash cans and dumpsters to give her their freshest food, finding food isn't a problem for her. Edmund's car takes care of him, in a very real way.The magic in this book isn't like Gandalf's or even Harry Dresden's, it isn't *big.* But it is transformative of several lives. Maybe yours too?
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	These three Miles Vorkosigan novellas are very wonderful and different from her other novels. No space opera in any of them, their brevity is one of their strengths."Mountains of Mourning" is a terrific jumping off place to begin the Vorkosigan series. Miles is 20, has just graduated from the Academy and is sent by his father to be his Voice. We see in this novella how very backward rural Barrayar can be and how much some people can change. I like this one so much I teach it."Labyrinth" is about another woman in Miles life."The Borders of Infinity" is one mission Admiral Naismith failed-- or that's how he feels. It's a heart- breaking story.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	0	but I teach 9th graders and I'm not its intended audience. This too spare book I found ultimately uninvolving. Augie's troubles left me flat. Lydie Rose would have been the main character in a high school book and the hinted at fantasy would have been more blatant.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Doesn't every family who encounters autism come at it differently?I went to high school with Zachary & Mori's uncle. I knew about the book, but had never seen it for sale. I was so thrilled when their grandmother pointed out where I could get "their" book. It's a loving book about a loving family. My own daughter is autistic. In part, I bought the book for a classroom school library -- I am also a special educator-- to share with other parents of disabled kids.I will eagerly read anything else Zachary writes about his brother and family.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	That Day the Rabbi Left Town is a pleasant enough book in the Rabbi Small series. The last novel Kemelman wrote I read elsewhere, this novel has Rabbi Small resigning from the Barnard's Crossing Temple to teach at Windermere College in Boston. At one point the rabbi who takes Rabbi Small's job says he is not a man of the cloth. I said "Huh?" Then I looked it up. A man of the cloth was originally a liveried servant, who wore a uniform. A man who took up the cloth was wearing a uniform. Rabbis didn't wear uniforms in medieval times or in Rabbi Small's time. What I like best about these books is how he explains his world and his thought processes. And the Temple, suburban and college politics are delightful!
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	Has Yarbro written very similar novels about Saint- Germain? Yes, she has. Yet I continue to read them and she continues to write them. Saint-Germain is forever the exile, always helping people with the medicine he has learned in his very, very long life, the money he has learned to acquire either in shipping or as an alchemist, actually making gold and jewels. He is a good man. He is more human, for all that he would disagree with that assessment, than most of his fellow people. I care about his adventures. I care that he "lives."This book is set in Rome in the third century, called the Decadence. The child- emperor Heliogabalus diverts the Roman people with circuses and sibarytic parties. While his tax collectors rob the populace blind -- or try to in Sanctus- Franciscus' case. Meanwhile, factions of Christians are jockeying for control. (I would have preferred to hear about Peterine groups instead of Paulists. Paulists I recognize, Peterines would have been new to me.) There is a tax collector and a Paulist who are out to get Sanctus- Franciscus. There is also a woman dying from lead poisoning who he attempts to help -- and she is massively unlikeable. Was she horrible before lead poisoning or did it make her a harridan? Was there a before lead poisoning for her-- she talks about it as a disease in her family...My daughter used to love the Magic Tree house books. They had the same characters time- traveling to different times and places. She learned history that way. I prefer these days to read my history in historical fiction, it feels more "real." I like reading history through Saint- Germain's lens.But other reviewes here are correct, this may not be the best place to enter Saint- Germain's universe for first- time readers. While there is a chronology in how Yarbro wrote these books, I don't generally believe it needs to be carefully followed. If Hotel Transylvania is convenient read it, or read Darker Jewels or Out of the House of Life.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	1	This book was recommended to me by someone who saw I liked Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, as having a similar setting. In Spencer's fantasy novel women lead the society, women are the soldiers and farmers, it is matrifocal, while men raise the children. Men are rare and highly valued, as a result. Spencer's book is light and fun and the oldest brother, who is about ready to be married off, has adventures. READ THAT BOOK!!!This one one has a 16 year old girl Xylina, a magic user as the narrator. Faro (or Ware)would have been better choices. It's better storytelling to read the POV of the underdog than the Alpha Dog. Especially when the Alpha Dog whines as much as this one does. And goes through nonsensical changes.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I've read Strasser's Give a Boy a Gun and Myers' Shooter. Both are YA and take place in the aftermath of the school shooting. This is *NOT* a YA book, though it may be appropriate for some teens, and takes place in the time before. I will read Cullen's non-fiction about Columbine, and Barret's, Pierre's, Shriver's and Picoult's novels on this timely topic. We are learning the signs to watch for when adolescents are about to explode. What about adults? Are the stressors -- and should the responses be-- the same for a 41 year old as a 14 year old?(I read this the weekend an unemployed immigrant shot up the program he attended that taught English to immigrants. And another unemployed man shot three police called in a domestic situation.)Edwin is at the end of his rope. He has no friends, except for the toxic Flake. What he has is bullies. And though people see and comment on the results of his being beaten up daily, no one responds appropriately. His Art teacher is supportive. His English teacher has to send him to the principle, but he understands. The principal gets him help. But it comes too late. His mom and dad are supportive, they often ask him what's wrong, but he can't or won't respond. From what he does tell us, it's pretty clear he has a tumor or traumatic brain injury. He had headaches all the time, he can't sleep or concentrate. Is he a victim or a perpatrator? Does it matter?
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I enjoy time travel novels and short stories. Connie Willis' novels To Say Nothing of the Dog and The Doomsday Book are the funniest and most tragic sf novels out there. They are also about time travel and the people caught up in its paradoxes.Dan Eakins' uncle dies and leaves him a timebelt enabling the 19 year old to time travel to the past and future. Soon enough Dan and various versions of himself are all he is interested in, including sexually. It's a novel about identity, with a character who has none. Fascinating stuff!"So I'm relaxed. At ease with myself. Happy. Because I know who I am.I'm Dan and Don and Diane and Donna.And Uncle Jim too. And somewhere, Aunt Jane.And little Danny. I diaper him; I powder his pink little fanny and wonder that my skin was ever that smooth. I clean up his messes. My messes."This novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1973 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1974. Gerrold was robbed!
A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	1	Man, did I *hate* this book! It's not that it's not well- written, it is, it's being in the presence of the main character. The protagonist, who tells the story in first person, is boorish, arrogant and a monster. Nicholas Van Tassel is an indifferent professor at a small New Hampshire college at the turn of the twentieth century who sees a woman during a fire and cannot conceive of her not wanting him, only she never did, including after agreeing to marry him. Once they are married, this man who can see no further than the end of his nose, nor can he perceive or imagine what people, including his wife whom he professes to love, think or feel.

A1BUCXZTW926PL	0	0	It took me six days to read 221 pages out of this 295 page book. For others, that might be fast, for me, that's S-L-0-W. I didn't hate the book, I kept reading after the 50 page mark I usually give a book. The book leisurely and convolutedly went nowhere, at least this read. Perhaps one day I'll get around to finishing this novel, but this week, this summer, is not that time. While I liked the setting, a town in Upstate New York made up of mediums, Spiritualists and charlatans, based apparently on a real town of the same. (Frankly, I think I'd rather watch the HBO documetary from a couple years ago on the real town: "Nobody Dies in Lily Dale.")The first person narrator Naomi Ash is an unreliable narrator and that's hard for me to take when my go to feeling about the subject is skepticism, unless the author makes me believe, which she never did. I love urban fantasy as a genre, it's typically easy to get me over that unbelieving hump, with compelling characters and a contemporary- like setting. This novel has only half of that.But I did and do appreciate that Nancy Pearl is trying to bring books out that readers might not have heard of when they first were published. While this one wasn't my cuppa, the next one may be! I also appreciate that I got this book from the Amazon Vine program.
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	0	The man who wrote this book didn't meet Buster or Eleanor, nor is he interested in tearing them down, he's a young-ish fan of the films-- and a very good writer. He concentrates primarily about Buster's films, the two- reelers and features of the late teens and 20's. He's less interested in Buster's films and appearances after the 20's when he lost his studio and autonomy and that's okay with me. (Those films can be hard to find, derivative of his earlier glories and can be sad. With the caveat of "The Awakening" that he made for tv in 1953 and I found on You Tube which is very special and based on Gogol.)"... Sherlock, Jr. is a story about being able to do two things at once: move and entertain, dream and wake, negotiate between our real and our better selves - how are we all, in the end projectionists and detectives... Sherlock Jr. is a testament to the imaginative impulse...the amount of ourselves that we put into the movies, and what the movies give back to us. For when the lights come up and we're shoved rudely back into our misfit selves, we find we're a little better off. Our ghostly flights sustain us. And then it's time to kiss the girl." (149)
A1BUCXZTW926PL	1	1	I am a giant fan of the silent film work of Buster Keaton. As of this writing, I have not gotten around to watching the two features included in this set, but I have watched several of the harder to find shorts. The picture and film quality is crisp. The music is appropriate. This set is an excellent value. It's recommended for Buster Keaton fans such as myself, -- I had some Keaton video that I lost to floods-- or to film fans who have not yet experienced Buster Keaton.
A1BUEVQK9BLIM8	0	1	This book was assigned as the text for my applications programming class. Even though I faithfully read and highlighted each section, I was still completley lost. While I normally appreciate succinct writing, this book is a little bit *too* right to the point. I don't find the explanations of key concepts to be thorough enough for a rank beginner like myself, and the code examples are not really all that helpful.In hopes of salvaging my GPA, I went and bought Learn To Program with Java by John Smiley, and found it to be much more useful. The book is written as if you are sitting in a programming class, with fellow students who ask very lucid and insightful questions. I recommend it instead, if you are looking to be hand-held through your first Java programming experiences.
A1BUHVRQKY02RH	1	1	Love this phone but didn't like the web page you can go to,to download wallpaper and stuff for it. Watch out for that it's a gimmick! Plus you can't reach Motorola by phone it your phone stops working.
A1BUHVRQKY02RH	0	0	Ordered this item for Christmas from A company called Apc-Discs-Books. Boy was that A wrong move that I regretted doing. Product didn't work all I got was sound no picture. Then when I emailed seller they tried to say I was getting an attitude because I wanted A refund. So I contacted Amazon but that didn't help they acted like they didn't have much control over the matter even though I failed A claim. Lesson learned if something sounds too good to be true it parable is.
A1BUHVRQKY02RH	1	1	These earrings are cute and made very well. Buying these little gems are A true delight. Your getting more bang for the buck and can't go wrong with these earrings. Perfect with A pair of skinny jeans.
A1BUTZY8EL6Q3	1	1	Everette and Miles have been partnered for 7+ years and are raising Billy, an autistic child with a love of sailing ships. The spark has obviously gone out of their relationship as all Miles seems interested in is making sure Everett removes the mold from the bathroom ceiling, use cost saving coupons and repair the lawn sprinkler while he and Billy spend some time with Billy's grandparents. Not even a hug or a kiss for Everette when he and Billy leave on their week long trip. A chance encounter with a young writer from Minnesota, Chance (yes, that is his name), who is trying to write a novel loosely based on his life brings Everette and Chance together for one amazing week.I thought the acting was excellent. Although there are a few gaps in the overall story that are left for the viewer's imagination the outcome of the movie is surprising in this day and age of self-centeredness and personal happiness at the expense of others.Life isn't always fair. Sometimes we make commitments and then situations change. Billy started out a normal child but became autistic. Everette and Miles' relationship probably started out well and then deteriorated as the stress of life and raising Billy took its toll. Chance had been searching to find his real self and he found it in the redwoods with Everette -- "I'm not lost anymore."This is a story about love, forgiveness, commitment, and life itself. It is one of the best romance stories I have ever seen.
A1BUTZY8EL6Q3	0	0	I am a fan of Matthew Montgomery and was quite disappointed in this film. The plot was disjointed and the acting a bit strained. I did not really appreciate the lead female character (Eddy Malone played by Rebekah Kochan) very much. She was absolutely grating and not worth her agent's time. The last 15 minutes of the film were, in my judgment, the best of the entire movie. If you are a Montgomery fan I think you will be disappointed in this film.
A1BUTZY8EL6Q3	1	1	I have to admit to being a bit skeptical about renting this film as I was not quite sure if I would enjoy the subject matter. I am glad I overcame my skepticism as this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The story line was as others have described it and the emotional content was first rate with excellent acting and several minor subplots beneath the surface. I had the ending pretty well figured out but I am not going to spoil that for a prospective viewer.Rent it or buy it. I don't think you will be disappointed.
A1BVAT9W4407MS	1	1	This is a very fun toy. My cat Philina absolutely loves this.What I like about this toy, it doesn't come off the string like the other cat toys.
A1BVAT9W4407MS	1	1	I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pet carrier. One word, Fabulous.My cat fit in perfect and it wasn't a hassle putting her in there.I don't have a car and have to use public transportation to take her to the groomer or the vet.This Pet carrier makes everything easy and is stylish.
A1BVAT9W4407MS	1	1	I must say I love this movie out of all 13 of them. This is absolutely one of my favorites. Also the animation still is close to original. After this Land before time film, the animation goes downhill. And I was a former animation major so I can tell the difference.Overall the story was great, animation is still good, characters are still in characters as far as personality, the songs are good too. Buy this film :)
A1BVL8LI6Y04S5	1	1	I was so stunned to read the one-star review that I had to write. Above anything I have ever read, this book changed my life. It was a clarion call for we who say we are Christians to wake up and absorb the radically uncomfortable messages of the real Jesus, Jesus the Jew, the Jesus who existed before the apostles hit the road to create the belief systems and institutions that undergird Christianity. His profound messages speak of love for the dispossessed, the exploited, the forgotten, and challenge our rationalizations about why we deserve to enjoy such cushy lives without thinking twice about our impact elsewhere in the world. If you want to learn, and to grow deeply and broadly in your faith and in its expression in the world, read this book. But be warned: you may feel a strong pull to radically change your own life -- for the sake of others.
A1BVL8LI6Y04S5	1	1	I am a health care lawyer sometimes tasked with helping people face difficult end of life issues. This is the most sensitive and lovingly realsitic book of its kind that I've seen -- and there are many other good ones out there. Pssst -- you also can get it through a free pdf download at www.hardchoices.com . The booklet is prettier, but whatever the format, it's a vital read. I've always recommended it to clients, but my own family used it to open up hearts and minds -- and settle an ugly dispute between my mother and one of her brothers -- when my grandfather was dying of Alzheimer's. Hank Dunn's work is a God send.
A1BVL8LI6Y04S5	1	1	I enjoyed Rhonda Byrne's "The Secret," and have found its principles exciting and applicable in my life. But, my more common experience of "manifesting" has been through ... God, introduced in my case through the Christian perspective.*I rented "The Secret Things of God" ("TSTOG") because I was curious to see a Christian take on "The Secret." I confess that often I am made uncomfortable by most Christian media, because it can be so heavy-handed and saccharine. But I trust Henry Cloud because of his excellent and sensible "Boundaries" books, written from the perspective of a psychologist who believes in God.Initially, I was put off by the first minutes of the DVD, in particular because of some cheesy production values. I felt a little embarrassed to be watching this in front of my teenaged son, because he'd also loved "The Secret" -- and this looks nothing like that slick flick. Oh dear, the music, the disconnected-looking expressions on the faces of the agreeably nodding audience, the moving mist in the scenic background - eck! But then I listened, really listened to what he was saying - and was deeply affected. Deeply. Surprisingly, so was my reflexively-skeptical 14-y.o. son.Like another reviewer, at first I also thought Dr. Cloud was putting down "The Secret," and so felt some resistance to opening up to his perspective. However, when I really listened, I heard him supporting the essential messages of "The Secret" - and yet adding so much more valuable information, not just from another, but from a broader, perspective. As examples, in TSTOG Dr. Cloud provides references to scientific research, gives the Biblical basis for "the law of attraction," clarifies God's desire for us, and explains the lessons underlying the inevitable challenges and trials we will face in life-- whether or not we "attracted" them. Parallels to the positive and negatives poles of the law of attraction, it also comfortingly emphasizes that God is actively "for" us and that guilt has no role in our relationship with God. This DVD went as far as "The Secret," and for me, well beyond, because it gives practical perspectives on real life and offers a welcome spiritual approach to transforming reality.By the way, the (mystical) manifestations made possible by the "law of attraction" and changing our thinking are shown here to be due to opening to, and trusting God's guidance, as well as realizing the incredible power our patterns have in attracting circumstances to us. And, consistent with "The Secret," we are revealed to be co-creators of our lives, working in collaboration with God. The key difference between the two approaches is that "The Secret Things of God" asserts that the power at work in the universe is a personal, relational, intimate God.One thing I greatly appreciated about this DVD, in contrast to "The Secret," is the absence of emphasis on lavish material abundance or "get rich quick" hopes. Long discomfited by what's at the heart of the "prosperity gospel" preached by televangelists and Prayer of Jabez promoters, I similarly squirmed at "The Secret's" promises about acquiring expensive "things." In contrast to "The Secret," TSTOG 's "things" to be gained are far more lasting and precious: powerfully satisfying relationships with others, ourselves, and God.I appreciated the fair shot at ecumenism as well: the DVD includes interesting views by a Rabbi and an Orthodox priest.As a thinking Christian unafraid to explore beyond the traditional faith boundaries --indeed, as one whose faith is strengthened by open consideration of other perspectives on spirituality and reality-- I found this DVD so refreshing! How delightful to find a smart, helpful, reassuring, encouraging, and both mind-broadening and faith-strengthening take on not just "the secret" of the "law of attraction" but many other "secrets" of the Judaeo-Christian faith. This has been so valuable to me that I am here at Amazon to buy this DVD.I REALLY liked this, and recommend it especially to Christians interested in "The Secret" and to fans of "The Secret" who are curious about faith.---*(My most significant experience with miraculous "manifestation" has been recovery from Stage IV cancer.)
A1BVL8LI6Y04S5	1	1	Having lived through the era of which Tyson so eloquently speaks -- just in another town, but having very similar experiences -- every time I pick up this book it is like seeing old friends from my childhood neighborhood (some kind, some wise, some cruel). "Blood Done Sign My Name" is beautiful, heart-rending -- with just enough sweet memories, comic diversion, and fascinating insights to make it bearable. Every time I thought, "oh, this is just too sad [or infuriating]," Tyson shifted to something funny or fascinating, making it easy to turn the pages. It's brilliantly written with a historian's eye and yet with the pure-hearted insight of a boy in love with the world. Phenomenal book!!This book, destined to become a classic, is all the more important now, because unless we know our history, we are doomed to repeat it. Our community is facing re-segregation of our public schools -- a tragedy in the making. Anyone too young to remember what it really was like in a "separate but unequal" world needs to read this wonderful, surprisingly uplifting book!
A1BVPBS0GBAAUK	1	1	I am a Saga fan ... but I do tend to enjoy studio albums over live recordings. Unfortunately, this album is no exception. Although the production is good, I do prefer Saga's studio versions of the chapter songs. So, I thought I would put together my own studio version of the chapters in an iTunes playlist. For those interested, here are the songs and their studio album sources:Disk 11. Chapter One: Images -- Images at Twilight2. Chapter Two: Don't Be Late -- Silent Knight3. Chapter Three: It's Time -- Images at Twilight4. Chapter Four: Will It Be You? -- Saga5. Chapter Five: No Regrets -- Worlds Apart6. Chapter Six: Tired World -- Saga7. Chapter Seven: Too Much To Lose -- Silent Knight8. Chapter Eight: No Stranger -- Worlds ApartDisc: 21. Chapter Nine: Remember When -- Full Circle2. Chapter Ten: Not This Way -- Full Circle3. Chapter Eleven: Ashes To Ashes -- House of Cards4. Chapter Twelve: You Know I Know -- Marathon5. Chapter Thirteen: Uncle Albert's Eyes -- Full Circle6. Chapter Fourteen: Streets Of Gold -- Marathon7. Chapter Fifteen: We'll Meet Again -- House of Cards8. Chapter Sixteen: Worlds Apart -- MarathonIf you are a real Saga fan, this CD is quite enjoyable ... but for the rest I recommend their studio recordings. I give this album 3.5 stars (rounded it up to 4 'cause I really do love this band).
A1BVPBS0GBAAUK	1	1	I have a Mac system and this headset works great. Sound is acceptable and mic works fine. The big plus is the USB adaptor. I plug it into my system and the computer automatically switches the audio in and out to the headset. Unplug and everything goes back to normal. Perfect for my needs.
A1BVPBS0GBAAUK	1	1	Update: Had this for almost a year; my review below is still our opinion. We are now purchasing this for our guest bathroom.We've only been using this unit for a short time, but so far so good. Here are our observations:1. Although it looks metallic ... this baby is 100% plastic. So we'll see how long it lasts.2. Installation was a breeze. Instructions said "hand tighten" and so I did. Used teflon tape and have little to no leaks.3. Ball joint to move around the unit works perfectly. On other units I have owned they were usually too tight; this one is perfect.4. Switch to use just handheld or combo is placed well and works fine.5. Water pressure is amazingly strong.6. I tested the water volume and these were the results: 2 gal/min from Base unit, 2 gal / min from Handheld unit, 3.25 gal / min from combined Base and Handheld. And living in a drought prone area (central coast, CA) we want to conserve as much water as we can so we probably won't be using the combined feature.7. Handheld unit on the "massage" setting really puts out pressure.8. Handheld unit fits snugly into base unit. I can see how it might pop out, but this has not happened to us yet.
A1BVQJDIMPQYZL	1	1	Buy this book and read it! This is perhaps the most entertaining book on a scientific subject that I have ever read. The writing is tight, witty, and clear. The explanations make sense, and the biographical anecdotes about mathematicians through the ages are fascinating. If you teach math, this book will arm you with anecdotes to keep the kids awake and amused! If you're a parent of a teenager who finds nothing stimulating in mathematics or science, but enjoys reading, give them this book. The book is not difficult to read. Anyone with a basic interest in history and science, even at a lay level, will enjoy it. However, the mathematical reader will also find interest here. That is the magic that Mlodinow weaves here - a book about science and math for any audience. If you're looking for detailed explanations of modern physics, you won't find them here. If that's your goal, read this book anyway, and supplement it with a more technical treatment of the physics from other texts. Mr. Mlodinow, we eagerly await your next book!
A1BVQJDIMPQYZL	1	1	This movie is simply brilliant. [Negative] critique needs to be replaced by something more consistent with most viewers.
A1BVWPQD5B7XX3	0	1	There were not all that many names for being a baby name book. A few were interesting, but most you can figure out why they aren't in common use anymore.
A1BVWPQD5B7XX3	1	0	All my favorite Hitchcock movies are in this one, unlike most collections with his name on it which tend to have a bunch of his worst productions.
A1BVWPQD5B7XX3	1	1	The only stapler I will have in my house, or on my desk. Have never had one of these staplers mess up. Fantastic.
A1BW806535Y8BK	1	1	I know you can see reruns of Big Bang but that will end and I want to be able to watch these for a long, long time. Get them before you loose out and no I don't own DVD rights to the show ( I only wish ).
A1BW806535Y8BK	1	1	See my comments on season 2. The progression of the Doc. is progressing but most people would find it maddening to actually deal with a real person like him. Despite that I find both the Doc and the towns people fascinating.
A1BW806535Y8BK	1	1	I love many of the British Shows but this is one of my favorite. (I don't like the Abbey seines) We were watching the Doc on PBS but it seemed like such a long time from Saturday to Saturday that I was really pleased to see it for free on Amazon Prime.It revolves around a London surgeon who develops a phobia about blood and as a result takes a GP position in a coastal small town fishing village. He is VERY formal and quite the stuffed shirt but slowly (VERY SLOWLY) he begins to see things differently. There is an interesting romance between one of the local school teachers and the Doc. Because he is so socially inept you wonder if the town will ever get use to him and if he will ever get up the courage to ask the school teacher on a date.His trials and tribulations are fun (and sometimes maddening) to watch.Great show, well worth the time.
A1BWAF5BSBIYLT	1	1	I love to bake and I spotted these things while I was wandering around on Amazon. I bake a lot of cookies and make a lot of bread and biscuits. I know I have saved a lot of money on parchment paper. I never did like to put more grease or butter on what I was cooking and this mat has helped me more than anything that I have ever bought on Amazon. I highly reccomend that every one should have one. I have bought 3 and I think I will give some of them for Christmas gifts. All I say is try them. You will be amazed.
A1BWAF5BSBIYLT	1	1	When I towed my boat I had a lot of play in the receiver hitch. Hit a bump and it sounded like the boat had left the truck. It caused the truck to weave around on the road. I purchased this hitch tightener and it stopped all of the movement. It is easy to install and only takes a few minutes. If you have the same problem that I did I highly recommend this product. The weave and rattle will be gone forever and it makes your vehicle safer to drive while towing.
A1BWAF5BSBIYLT	1	1	I found this stanley level on Amazon and the price was great. Got the level in 2 days, used it to work on my garage and was exactly like it is supposed to be. Stanley products are just as good as the more expensive ones. I am just a weekend carpenter and I own a lot of Stanley tools.
A1BWM8B5RA1N7R	1	1	Excellent book to help you choose the right technology for your project.Covers several frameworks, patterns, and discusses alternatives for the presentation, web, and data tiers.Interesting ideas about the use (or overuse) of EJBs.
A1BWM8B5RA1N7R	1	1	The book provides a good introduction to Struts and a starting point for more advanced topics & design patterns which may be found on-line. It does cover simple scenarios for extending the stuts framework. May be usefull for those who are not familiar with related technologies such asxdoclet, commons logging, and OR mapping. Overall it is not an advanced book.
A1BXAI7X9JBAWO	1	1	This item is very convenient for my purpose. It works great!!! 4 months ago, I moved my computer to an adjacent room. The room doesn't have a cable drop so I tried wireless routers and adapters (used a couple of brands, one after the other). That didn't work well for me due to some minor glitches that occurred every now and then. Fully recommended.
A1BXKGTNQIIBWG	1	1	I'm going to keep this review relatively short and simple. This cd is one of the greatest of all time. When it came out it should have generated the same response as the doors did back in the late 60's, but for some reason just didnt get the same public recognition. The sound is origional, theres nothing really quite like it, I doubt that another band can ever capture what sublime did on this album. Next time you're cruising on a warm summer day with the breeze blowing throw your hair, pop this in your cd player and let subllime take you away.
A1BXKGTNQIIBWG	1	1	I'm sick of reading all this ... from people who think they know everything there is to know about music. Most people that write bad reviews on this album are people who only like a band if it is underground; They try to sound smart by saying the vines are undeserving compared to different bands, when the truth is that is those bands were as big as the vines the same people would say they .... This is overall a really good sounding cd; in my opinion deserving of its popularity. Yes, there are influences shown on it, but they are wrapped into the vines own sound. It's impossible for a band today to not be influenc1ed by other bands, so of course if you search hard enough you will find similarities. To wrap up the ramblings that you have just read, i would recomend buying this cd.
A1BXKGTNQIIBWG	0	0	This book is simply awful. Orlean simply saw one odd piece of news, exploited it to every angle imaginable, and completely bored me along the way. A good author could get the point of the book across in about thirty pages, but Orlean uses 200. This isn't a book, it's just a collection of newspaper clippings. Please do not support this terrible literature; if you're going to buy it just get it from a library.
A1BXN03GID5INE	1	1	I first saw this production about twenty years ago, more or less. I like the nod it gives to the celto/pagan elements of the tale. The armour, while not probably what Arthur and his men may have worn, assuming they existed, and they may have, it is still in keeping with the traditional vision of what a knight looked like. There is an interesting mix of romantic knighthood vs the bully-thug with the sword. The behavior was, perhaps somewhere in the middle. The sound effects and special effects are a little dated, but, well, it is about twenty years old. The Green Knight's axe looks sharp and deadly, but the effect is ruined by the jetcraft sounding noise which whirrs as Connery swings it about. I strongly recommend this for any language arts instructor teaching the Arthuriad or mythology.Gilbert Sarabia
A1BXN03GID5INE	1	1	I found this production to be poetic and educational. The opening which features the recitation in Wessex dialect is just one of the finest specimens of aural old english I've yet to hear. (But then, I don't hear that many.) It's an excellant critical presentation of Beowulf and and equally excellant presentation of the Saxon culture, it's life and times.I do take a little issue with the neglect of the influence of Roman cavalry armour on the Sutton Hoo helmet. But, this is nit-picky on my part. I would recomend this for anyone teaching British literature, or world history, or just for your own edification...benefits will accrue! Add it to your curriculum today, integrate it into your lesson plans.Gilbert Sarabia
A1BXN03GID5INE	0	1	A cute and interesting read. Not bad toliet reading at that. Nice cover, promises much, but delivers little beyond that promise. You can do the same thing on a skateboard too, with skill and practice. Read and enjoy, but you won't get anything beyond another book for your sinister collection of "dark knowledge". I think the author has hit on a new way to sell bad fiction. I suppose that's a magick of a sort.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I loved this book and so did my kids. However, they loved it so much that the pages are now falling out. This isn't because they've abused it, but because of the wire spiral-type binding and thin pages that the book is made of. Although this feature allows for more pages and ease of turning, one wrong turn of accidental hard turn and RIIIIPPP, there goes half the page on food. However, that's what they made tape for - right?Great great book and I highly recommend it. However, be forewarned that you'll have to tape things here and there because of the book design, but some of that is just life with growing children.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I'm not a big classical music fan - I love all types of music. However, I love to listen to this symphony, suite, whatever (not 100% on the music term). When I was a kid, these songs were so ubiquitous, they were the bumper songs on the 6 & 10:00 news of two different local TV stations. All of them are great especially "Mars" and "Jupiter" which are my favorites. I've probably listened to this on 8-track, cassette, and DVD hundreds of time. Good Stuff!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	Absolutely couldn't put this book down. I read this one and the previous book in about a 10-day timespan. The author's writing skill, plus the subject matter, makes this a wonderful page turner. However, this isn't because it's mindless fluff. Although some of it is fictionalized dialogue (we obviously don't know exactly what was said day by day at Valley Forge), the historical dates, people, and actions is 100% accurate and since the author uses letters and other historical content as the basis for the dialogue, some of it is actually the real deal.I know what the history books say. Schaara's books are a wonderful way to relive the Amercian Revolution from a different perspective.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	Ok, you have 12 guys that spend the entire movies huddled in a small jury discussion room and do nothing but talk for 90 min. How is that interesting? Let me tell you, the first time I watched this movie, I was riveted. The casting director should have won an Oscar for how well he crafted this ensemble. Every one of these 12 are wonderful actors and take their parts very seriously. Henry Fonda is obviously the star of the movie, but he by no means carries the movie - Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and the others are all co-equals and add the necessary spice that moves this movie one that could be watched over and over again. It was recently on TCM and although I've seen it probably half a dozen times, know most of the lines, and what's going to happen, I was glued to my seat for that whole 90 min. I just can't get enough of it!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	Chris Tomlin is a very gifted musician and this album is no exception to his ability. I LOVE LOVE LOVE about half the tracks and really like the rest. Thus it gets played often both at work and on my I-Pod I goto a church that sings somewhat "progressive" music during worship and we do four tracks off this album regularly - Famous One, Come Let Us Worship, Enough, and Wonderful Maker. It's a great CD to just through into the stereo or your car, crank, and praise God to. If you are a Tomlin fan, this is a must-buy. If you are simply a lover of great praise and worship, this is a must-buy too. Better yet, get an extra one for your neighbor and watch him get saved!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I bought this for my 8 year old son - a Mario/Sonic addict - and it is really fun. You can play many different sports - most of them revlve around running, but then so do the Olympics - and all of them appeal to one of our family members or the other.Good things:The wide spectrum of games, the different characters with different skills (making you pick someone based on what he/she can do and not on who he/she is), and the wonderful graphics.Bad things:Boy will your arms get tired. Even swimming makes you do similar running moves so unless you are in good shape you'll need to take a break after a while. I also thought that the archer was somewhat complicated - though not impossible. The directions aren't that great either. On the javelin it took many times of awful throws until my son really cranked one and then all of us said "What did you do?!?!" Directions could be ALOT more explanatory - you shouldn't have to stumble on the right combination to do something right.Really like this game. My son likes it alot more than me, but its pretty fun for adults too.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	0	Before I knew who Rush was, a friend kept playing Exit Stage Left over and over on cassette. After awhile, I had to have a copy. This album is a classic of classic songs from Rush. All the songs rock and Rush is one of the few bands whose songs sound good live - not like some kind of twisted, stream of consciousness, we've played these songs a hundred times and we are REALLY bored crap like many other bands do. The breaks don't bother me either - what do you want, a track or two cut off to make room for another minute of clapping at the beginning/end of all the tracks?!?! Great album from a great band!

This Tie Fighter, although now made by Hasbro, is the same toy and just as fun. Makes a 40 yr old feel like a kid again, playing with his son's toys.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I checked this book out from the library - after seeing the colorful cover and guessing the general story line - because both my kids (4 & 8) love superheroes. This was a wonderful book to read and both of them loved it. It has a funny story line (and the little comic inserts are cool too - like "Meanwhile Downtown trouble Is Afoot") and also reading about how the son considers his superhero Dad just a normal guy is a nice family-centered touch.I guess the reading skill level of the book depends on your children, but my 4 yr old re-read it after we were done and it was something my 8 yr old could finish in about 5 min.With the colorful pictures, imaginative story line, and rhyming dialogue, this is a great kids book. I plan on buying it and the other "Atomic Ace" book for the kids today.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	The first four books in Frank Peretti's "Cooper Kids" series. We were given the set by a friend and were extremely thankful as we have also recently purchased the next 3 books in the series. Whether battling demonic forces, OT-inspired giants, a band of cultists, or communist forces, the action is always intense with some of that "Indiana Jones" feel. I felt that the fourth book was easily the best written with a much stronger Christian message, while the first book is somewhat light on meaty dialogue and character progression - something you'd expect from an introductory book in a long series. One note, the third book - The Tomb Of Anak - is not really appropriate for younger kids as we felt that the action surrounding the central "Goliath" villain was somewhat scary at times.Throughout the books, Peretti treats the devout Christian lives of the Coopers as just another normal part of the story and, contrary to some Christian books, movies, or audio tapes that I've had, this aspect of their lives does not seem false or forced into the storyline in order to turn out a "Christian" product - when the Coopers stop to pray before making a tough decision it is an appropriate action that only helps to further the action. Reading some of the reviews for this set or the individual books in the series, I think it's pretty funny when some obviously atheist parent tags the book as a "stealth Christian product" when anyone who knows Peretti's works or spends more than 5 min reading the book realizes it isn't a stealth Christian book - it's an OVERT Christian book and proud of it.Just as all the Cooper Kids books, the real message throughout the story is not the fantastic locales/enemies or gripping action and story telling, but the Christian values (faith, love, and perserverence immediately leap to mind) of the central characters. Always wonderful stories to be either read alone by your "tween" child (my 8 yr old could easly read the book alone), out loud at night as a bedtime story, or as part of a Bible curriculum for homeschoolers.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	0	The Second Book in Frank Peretti's "Cooper Kids" series. We were given the first 4 books by a friend and were extremely thankful. This time the Coopers are on the lookout for a lost missionary and find themselves on a Pacific island surrounded by a small village of transplanted Americans and Europeans who are brainwashed by their power-mad Cultest leader.As always Peretti treats the devout Christian lives of the Coopers as just another normal part of the story and, contrary to some Christian books, movies, or audio tapes that I've had, this aspect of their lives does not seem false or forced into the storyline in order to turn out a "Christian" product - when the Coopers stop to pray before making a tough decision it is an appropriate action that only helps to further the action.

A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	The Fourth Book in Frank Peretti's "Cooper Kids" series. We have read the first three books and couldn't wait to start this one. Although we are not quite done, we've found that the action is just as intense this time when the villain's are normal people - although can we ever call Communists "normal people"... ;-) This time the subject revolves around both Lila, and her growing unhappiness with her father (seen in flashbacks and memories throughout the book), and Dr. Cooper and his struggles to come to grips with the death of his wife during one of their archeological expeditions. As always Peretti treats the devout Christian lives of the Coopers as just another normal part of the story and, contrary to some Christian books, movies, or audio tapes that I've had, this aspect of their lives does not seem false or forced into the storyline in order to turn out a "Christian" product - when the Coopers stop to pray before making a tough decision it is an appropriate action that only helps to further the action.Just as all the Cooper Kids books, the real message throughout the story is not the fantastic locales/enemies or gripping action and story telling, but the Christian values (faith, love, and perserverence immediately leap to mind) of the central characters.

A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	0	0	Ok - I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book and the British movies, et al. So I think - cool - I can play a game that will have some of the same suspense as the book/movie. While this is true - the graphics are good and the overall look of the game is nice - the game play is HORRIBLE. Once I figured out all the characters are exactly the same as the book and the plot is exactly the same, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach about the $30 I had just spent...Good Things -* Some of the puzzles take a little bit of thought to figure them out.* Pretty pictures and engaging play keeps you interested.Bad Things -* Game is very linear. There is no veering from the track that is set for you. There are several places where you HAVE TO solve certain puzzles before you are allowed to go on. However it is often hard to know if you are done investigating or not.* You HAVE TO play through the whole game even if you figure out the killer halfway through. GRRR!!!* Some of the puzzles are infantile in simplicity and some are SO HARD that there is no way to solve w/o downloading the cheat. This seriously detracts from the game play.* If you know the book, you know the plot, who did it, and how it's solved. This fact makes the game play simply a job to get to the end.I really wanted to like this game, but it's hard. 95% of the game play is just dull plugging and chugging and searching for clues or solving easy puzzles, while the other 5% is impossible - not a great combo. While I freely admit that you can't expect a game based upon a book to have a plot that's some big surprise, it's basically the DOS "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" game with fancy graphics - exact same linearity and game style.Unless you have NEVER, EVER read this book/seen the movie, or want to really hope for the best that spending hours in front of the computer doing monotenous searching will give you that special thrill, look somewhere else. Just like "Murder On The Orient Express", the game makers took a wonderful premise jazzed it up with great graphics and then proceeded to torpedo the entire gameplay experience. Not a good combination...
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	My son got this toy with his birthday money and to say the least I was somewhat skeptical about how long it would be before it would be broken. Not that he's tough on toys, but since "nothing is made the way it used to be". Well to my surprise, it is extremely durable and he's been playing with it for almost a year. Nothing has broken, nothing has needed to be fixed and other than a few lost darts (normal attrition), we've only had to pull out one dart that was mis-fed (put in backwards) and other than that it's been perfect. You can also easily take it apart to give you a shorter gun and a hand gun which is kind of fun. The gun has been taken apart and put together dozens and dozens of times with no issues. The gun has a nice scope for "sniper" shooting, but it isn't telescopic or anything so the use of it is somewhat negligible - but still cool to pretend as there are legs under the barrel to give you even more "sniper" action. The butt stock also extends in an out, but we didn't figure out what use that would really have.I haven't read any of the other ratings, but it's hard for me to understand the 1- and 2-star ratings unless you either A) got one that was already broken and you want to complain about it or B) you have a hellion as a kid and he breaks everything. We also bought the adapter clip for his gun since the clip that comes with the gun only has 5 darts. Kind of skimpy, but the gun as a whole is well worth it. Because of his enjoyment of this particular Nerf gun, my son has bought three others all which he also thoroughly enjoys.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	0	For a kid who grew up in the 70's, Scooby Doo was it on Saturday Morning. I can still remember what cartoon half of these songs were from just by listening to the track AND I can picture the action that's going on during the song. Yes, I'm sick, but I love Scooby Doo. As those of us who grew up in the 70's know, the 1980's version of Scooby Doo was largely forgettable - mostly because of the introduction of Scrappy, the too often deletion of Fred, Daphne, & Velma from the cartoons, and mostly, the really poor cartoon artistry. While that has changed with the current incarnation of the Mystery Inc gang, unfortunately half of this CD (tracks 14-18) holds zero interest for me. Even the tracks from Scooby Goes Hollywood (11-13) are largely forgettable as I only saw the special once and never bothered to find/buy it on DVD. However, that's not Cartoon Network's fault.One small bone to pick. The songs are the stock - this is how it was recorded - track and thus have very little of the voiceovers and sound effects that come with their actual playing on the cartoons - and - which Scooby Doo lovers have come to expect when hearing the songs. However, this is a minor, geeks only, comment and again I don't think that this is really Cartoon Network's fault. Really love the CD. Happy to see it. Will play it - for the kids AND me - often!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	It has been long ere I have heard tell of The Avengers and their heroic exploits on Midgard. Although the treacherous Loki, under the cloak of an attempted invasion of the glorious realm by the barberous Ice Giants from Jotunheim, attempted to work his spells - thus leading the Mighty Thor to believe that these epic tales were not but trifles invented by puny mortals. However I regained my senses long enough to yell:"Villain! I say to the... NAY!"I then swiftly smote him with a most powerful strike from Mjolnir hoping to vanquish my foe with a single blow, but alas the God of Mischief was not finished yet. Having fought through the screening forces of Loki, the Warriors Three again were by my side. However, Loki was not without staunch allies of his own as Amora, The Executioner, and Ulik made haste to face off against us. With the gates of Valhalla yearning to claim us, my only response was to utter "Brazen ones, prepare to defend thyselves! Have At Thee!" as The Three and I leapt into battle. Although the end of this epic struggle has yet been told, surely all can raise a tankard at the strength of our desire to meet the arms of Hela head on because when immortals engage in combat, what can be the outcome?"Cannot even the All Father with his remaining good eye yet see that these tales of the mortal heroes called the Avengers (joined by this erstwhile Asgardian) be yet the best television show low these many ages past?
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I've bought three different Remington Beard and Mustache Trimmers to trim my goatee/side burns and the MB-200 continues in the long line of superior and affordably-priced trimmers.The trimmer is quiet, palm-sized, has a long battery life between charges, and does a wonderful job cutting. Recently I tried the Braun Cruze 6, which is twice as expensive, and it paled in comparison. Using the exact same cutting method, it routinely left hair that I had then go back with the Remington and trim. I liked the one I owned so much before buying the MB-200 that when the batteries died, I took it apart, jerry-rigged new rechargeable AA's into it, and used it for another 3-4 yrs.Honestly there really is no comparison with other trimmers and for $20-25 and a 5-10 year expected lifetime, you can't beat the price!!!

While I realize that the product isn't really designed to kill the larva that are in the soil, it didn't even kill the flying adults - even when I sprayed them directly onto the bugs. I also used the product on the aphids that were eating my roses and again there was no affect. After going 0-2, and it wasn't for underuse - I repeatedly sprayed mass quantities on the bugs - I decided to throw the product away and invest in something that would actually kill garden pests.Safer, organic, or not, I see no reason to spend $13 on a product that doesn't work - and the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray doesn't cut the mustard!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	E.B. Sledge brings the WWII exploits of a US Marine to us in all it's bloody, smelly, shocking, and heart-rending glory. Although today largely unknown, the Palau Campaign and specifically the battle for the island of Peleliu was just as contentious as the later battles of Okinawa (in which the author also fought) and Iwo Jima. Sledge does a fantastic job of bringing the war down to the level of the individual and really puts you in the fox hole so that you can relive the horrors of war with him. Although Sledge often recounts how he hates war and wishes that the jewels of a nations youth shouldn't have to be used as cannon fodder, he is by no means a passifist - he was a US Marine and is proud of his pedigree.This book is a must read for anyone who has ever looked down the business end of weapon, especially those who are or have been Marines, as well as those of us who are simply interested in military history.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	With an idea birthed in 1961 after the death of Ty Cobb, "The Glory Of Their Times" is filled with first-person interviews of some of the most note-worthy baseball players of first quarter of the 20th Century Baseball (such as Stan Coveleski, Sam Crawford, Fred Merkel, Rube Marquard, Smoky Joe Wood, Fred Snodgrass, Goose Goslin - to name only a few) and several from the second quarter (such as Hank Greenberg and Paul Waner). Also included are interviews from many baseball players that you've probably NEVER heard of including Davy Jones, Bill Wambsganss, Tommy Leach, Hans Lobert, and Jimmy Austin - all great players in their own right but for whom time has largely forgot. Not only do these players talk about growing up playing baseball, their sometimes circuitous and or tortured routes to the major leagues, and their playing careers, but they also talk at length about their peers, memorable events and games, and such immortals of the game as Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, John McGraw, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Frank Chance, Honus Wagner, and even Jim Thorpe and the 1919 Black Sox. Recorded over a five-year span, the interviews that author Lawrence Ritter taped are both unforgettable and irreplaceable. Back when baseball was more a team sport and the men played for the love of the game and not the money, the stories in the book make for an interesting and telling comparison to many of today's players who seem to have trouble talking about anything other than themselves.Many of the stories I liked best in the book were of the "challenged player makes good" variety. Read about Smoky Joe Wood going from lights-out World Series champion starter to useful outfielder. Or Chief Meyers' & Hank Greenberg's stories about overcoming racial prejudice. Or 19 year old Paul Waner showing up at training camp with the San Francisco Seals and going from a sore-armed starter into a Hall of Fame outfielder. Or how Sam Crawford could be one of the most under-rated players in Major League history (despite being in the Hall of Fame) due to sharing the same outfield with Ty Cobb. Or how the deaf and mute "Dummy" Hoy overcame his seeming disabilities to craft a very good 14 year career. Stories like this are very seldom found in baseball books which focus on the stars of the day to the almost complete absence of everyone else.As if the book needed anything else, the pictures that are included in the book are fabulous. One of the reviewers has already mentioned a photo of Walter Johnson casually standing next to friend Clyde Milan and almost all of the interviews include at least one photo of the player in question and also included are many of the players, teams, plays, and places that these old timers describe in almost unbelievable detail 30-40 years after the fact. It's useful to read the author's notes and the forward and he illustrates the path that he took in creating the book and states that much time was spent in corroborating the stories, plays, and stats that the players seemingly threw out off the tops of their heads. The glossary at the end of the book is also useful as a reference if you want to go back to a story about a particular player or team.All put together, this book is an engrossing page turner which every baseball fan should own!

As such I was expecting to learn little about the men that author Andrew Smith writes on in "Moondust" that I didn't already know. I mostly picked up this book because I thought it would be a fun diversion while on a trip to India and my son had checked it out from the library to help with a paper on Neil Armstrong. However what I was NOT expecting to learn about was about the childhood of the author. About how his boring little life was interspersed with tidbits from the moon program.Instead of "going in search" of where these former astronauts are today and relating this information in the text - a "Where are they now" story - he instead appears to decide that they are all freaks and near border-line basket cases, none of whom have found "real lives" since their daliances in space. One is a drunk, turned pimp for space. Another is a recluse who seems to be afraid of living. Another has nothing else to do but sign autographs because he's either broke, starved for attention or both. He meets Edgar Mitchell at a New Age convention (FREAK!). He meets Dick Gordon at a Sci-Fi convention (PATHETIC FREAK!). He manages to actually schedule a real interview (Holy Cow!) with Buzz Aldrin but openly points out to Aldrin how he feels his space exploration ideas are idiotic (ANOTHER PATHETIC FREAK!).And what else do we learn in this book? How much the author's Las Vegas room cost and how he spent the night boozing away with total strangers (WHO CARES?!) How he interviewed Aldrin the day after 9/11 (TWO PAGES OF AGAIN WHO CARES?!) How the author feels a necessary backdrop to every astronaut or discussion is what HIS IMPRESSION of the thought is or what HE WAS DOING when a moonlanding was taking place (PAGES AND PAGES OF WHO CARES?!)This book is a self-serving pile of nonsense and its a wonder there are so many people who seem to have liked it. My guess is many of these people have either never read an Apollo-era book or enjoy the thought of someone tearing people down. It's one thing to relate the truth of the situation. It's another to do nothing but look for flaws. One thinks that the author should instead turn the microscope on himself to determine why he so readily wishes to turn the lives of these men touched by fate into ugly carictures of themselves. That's what's really sad...
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I use the Westcott Titanium Bonded Scissor in my kitchen for many different household uses. It has a rounded, soft grip that nicely cushions my hand when I cut harder items, but also has a fine enough blade that I can cut smaller items. I've used the scissors to cut everything from lettuce to flowers to construction paper to plastic product wrapping to string and performs all rolls perfectly. And when it's gotten sticky, I throw it into the dishwasher and it comes out ready for more.All around it is a great, GREAT scissor and well worth the money!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I've enjoyed an Orange Pekoe and Black Tea blend for years. About eight years ago, I was introduced to an Indonesian brand that was a blend of Orange Pekoe, Black Tea, and Cinnamon. It was incredible! However, it was bought at a discount store and I was never able to purchase it retail - despite my dogged attempts. Ever since, I have been forced to go from one imitator to another looking for a replacement.Enter Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice which I first purchased at a specialty store that carried somewhat exotic products and have since purchased on Amazon.com. What can I say other than WOW!!!! This tea has such an INCREDIBLE taste. It is almost indescribable how beautifully the black tea mixes with the cinnamon and orange in your tea cup. I love the cinnamon taste so much, I actually OVER steep my tea bag in order to infuse as much of the powerful cinnamon taste as possible. I'm sure many tea enthusiasts in the UK and here in the US would be aghast at the thought of over-steeping tea as normally you would be left with a strongly bitter cup as the black tea would infuse too much of its taste into the water. However, this does not happen with Harney & Sons. Instead, the only thing you get is a stronger and stronger cinnamon & orange taste. I steep my tea so long that I often have to reheat my cup, but it is so utterly delicious (that would be the basking in fields of flowers with rainbows and unicorns kind of delicious) that I'm willing to wait another minute or two. Add a little sweetener and a touch of cream and its TO DIE FOR!!!As you can see, I can't say enough good things about either Harney & Sons teas in general or the Hot Cinnamon Spice blend in particular. I was so happy to find this tea - it truly blows away any brand that I've found - one of the many instances where you win when you pay for quality!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	A friend clued me on to this game and I'm thrilled. The game is pretty standard as you are dealt a deck of treasure and pirate ships - send out a treasure ship card and compete with your opponents' pirate ship cards to be the one to capture the treasure. The winner is the one with the most gold. Since the rules are pretty simple and the game only takes about 10-15 min, I found that the recommended age of 10-14 was actually too limiting as with a little coaching, my 7 yr old was able to easily play the game (she also easily playsBohnanzawhich is for 10-14 yr olds). However, to really have fun with the game you need to play the part of a pirate and get into all the piratey speech - "Avast there you Scurrrrrvy dog! I be stealing your treasurrrrrrre!!!" My kids love the opportunity to be goofy and play a fun game with Mom and Dad.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	Frankly I didn't know that this game was meant for teens until I visited the Amazon product page. We were given Bohnanza by my sister-in-law and at first we looked at it and said "You have got to be kidding me..." However, once we started playing, my wife and I absolutely could not get enough of it. We have played hundreds and hundreds of games of Bohnanza and have introduced dozens of our friends to this great little trading game. We love the pictures on the cards too - very imaginitive - and they always make us laugh while we are playing the game.There are several styles you can play the game. When my wife and I play alone, we usually play casually over tea or desert after the kids have gone to bed. It doesn't matter who wins - we just enjoy the time together. We have also played with other couples where it has gotten uber competitive - trades are only done if you think you get an advantage and fields are continually being ripped up to plant that card from your hand that you couldn't get rid of. Either way, it's all good. Although there are very good rules for playing the game with two players - we do it all the time - it is definitely much more fun to play with at least four as the trades are more plentiful which leads to a livelier game.The age group of this game, 10-14 years old, is not very indicative of the real age range who will enjoy it. So I think it should be one of those "up to 99 yrs old" games as I have yet to meet an adult that wasn't immediately hooked by Bohnanza. On the other side of the age spectrum, I was able to teach my 5 year old daughter how to play the game. It was rough at the beginning, but with a lot of coaching she was able to play with help - AND - she even won her first game. Now that she's seven, she can play with no problem or coaching. My son was 8 or 9 when he started playing and he really didn't need any help. So in my opinion, the recommended age bracket should more realistically be 8-99 years old.Please Note: there is nothing in the game box besides playing cards. I'm not sure why there is a great big warning about a "choking hazard". Unless the Government has turned so PC as to label a normal deck of playing cards as a "choking hazard", this page is mis-labeled and parents of young children SHOULD NOT BE hesitant in the least to purchase this product.
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	I have been using a "Noise Maker" of various brands to help me sleep since I was in grade school. I've always found that it helps to smooth out various night noises (especially in old, creaky houses) that sometimes cause little ones to wake and be unable to go back to sleep. As an adult, I appreciate the white noise's ability to block out all but the loudest exterior noises like passing cars and motorcycles. Now that I have kids, I don't have the unit turned on very loud and always hear when a child is awake even in the dead of night, but still enjoy the benefit of the SleepMate deadening loud noises. We also have one in all of the kids' rooms to help them fall asleep no matter what we are watching on TV or working on downstairs. Contrary to what you may think, I have no problem sleeping without it while on the road. I do hear more noises, but I have strong sleeping habits and thus am able to get back to bed. Sometimes we bring it along on trips, but only when we think we may have long days ahead of us and good nights sleep is critical.So I don't see the SleepMate as a crutch or a way to "block out the world" in any way. Instead, I use it to help blend annoying noises into the general white noise that fills my room. Since it generates white noise via a fan, rather than through looped sound bites, I found the SleepMate to far superior to products such asSound Oasis S-550-05 Sound Therapy SystemorEcotones Sound + Sleep Machinebecause no matter what setting I used (waves, wind, rain, white noise, etc) I could ALWAYS hear where the recording looped which actually PREVENTED me from going to sleep. So unless you are looking for something other than white noise - AND - are not overly observant (anal?) like I am, simply buy the Marpac SleepMate for you and your family and enjoy the benefits of a restful night!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	The most recent release from Alex & Stephen Kendrick (Flywheel,Facing the GiantsandFireproof), "Courageous" recounts a group Sheriff's Deputies and their struggle in not only their day-to-day work lives, but also their relationships at home. Convicted that he isn't living the life of the godly man that he should be, Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick) decides to draft what is essentially a Biblical code of conduct for his life. He then enlists his three co-workers (and his handyman) to join in this faith commitment and better their lives together. We then follow the quintet as they struggle through man-made trials (some of their own making) to be all that God had intended for them.The story is heart-warming and family-friendly as they come. The movie also lays down the gauntlet to men in a similar manner as "Fireproof" challenges married couples - are you going to continue in your secularized, fence-sitting, mediocre lives where we goto church once a week and "play Christian" or are you going to make the commitment to devote them to God? A must-have for all Christian families!!!
A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	1	1	Fireproof is a great Christian story about love, redemption, and honoring the bonds of matrimony. So many times, you hear stories of Christian marriages ruined by lack of trust, pornography, infidelity, money, etc and the characters in this movie are no different. They are both young, career-oriented people who allow the pressures and stresses of life to get in the way of what should matter most in their lives - God and eachother. Even as their marriage is rocks and ready to come apart, Calb (Kirk Cameron) rediscovers his faith, with the help of his father, and works to rewin the heart of his wife. A beautiful love story without turning into the sex-filled dramas that Hollywood churns out.If you like the movie, the Kendricks have also come out with many Fireproof-themed books and guides, including the sameLove Darebook that Cameron's character goes through in the move, to help Christians out there who also struggle to make marriages work amid the ugliness of modern life. Among these are: theFireproof Your Marriage Couple's Kit,The Love Dare Day by Day: A Year of Devotions for Couples, and theLove Dare & Couple's Study Bundle (Includes 2 Love Dare Books, a DVD & 2 Study Guides).Also for those who like the movie, check out other Kendrick productions includingFlywheel,Facing the Giants, andCourageous.

A1BXYCCDWBT6Y0	0	0	I had high hopes for this book....but once I actually saw it those hopes were destroyed! The pages are soooo dark (due to the terrible coloring job) I had a lot of trouble actually looking at any of the pages.My advice to everyone is if you find this book for 25 cents...buy it...otherwise stay away.
A1BXYCCDWBT6Y0	1	1	I've been a big fan of this series ever since book one! Great setting and very interesting menagerie of charaters. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
A1BY1H9X953WJI	1	1	Although I bought this game for my wife's cousin, I have had a chance to play it both in MP and campaign and it's very good. The graphics are wonderful and the environment is very rich and detailed. I only wish that there were bigger maps for multi player on one machine instead of just the inner city and missle base site maps. A large woodland/ravine/swamp map would be really nice to try out stealth movments with the ghillie suit and sniper rifle. Other than that, this is a great game! It has definately helped us on our airsoft team tactics.
A1BY1H9X953WJI	1	1	This switch worked right out of the box the first time it was plugged in. I have had it for over a month and no problems so far!Great buy!
A1BY1H9X953WJI	1	1	The product works great for doing what it was designed to do. I just wish I had ordered a longer one, but that's no points off of the product. Great buy!
A1BYBREI0QTTXA	1	1	I cannot say enough about the beauty and vast amount of information in this book. It is very aesthetically pleasing and would make the finest coffee table book with its colorful pictures and glossy pages. However, the book is also a wonderful resource as well giving history, anecdotes, and how-to information about the weddings of this most romantic of eras. Any Victorian buff or bride-to-be or lovers of good taste and form would LOVE this book. It is definitely one to buy!

A1BYBREI0QTTXA	0	0	This big glossy picture book is a big let down because all it shows is parts and pieces of garments. The details are useless without getting to see the effect on the whole garment. Who needs a book filled with collar and cuff close-ups? If you are looking for great pictures of 19th century dress- This is NOT the book for you!
A1BYBREI0QTTXA	1	1	If you love soul music, please get this album now! I put this cd in and heard my childhood playing, family laughing and dancing. I had forgotten some of these hits, but track by track it all came back to me. All of the songs are wonderfully produced, have meaningful lyrics, and the soul stirring voice of Mr. Davis hits home every time! This cd is a must for any serious old school collector.
A1BYDMYY2EDVRF	1	0	This book marks a critical point in the current trend of historical Jesus research. The basic layout uncovers a Jesus who was very much a practicing Jew of his time and within the culture of his people. Part of that culture included the expectation of a messiah who would redeem Israel from its current bondage under the Roman empire. Such an event or historical turning point is known as eschatology. Sanders argues that Jesus believed an eschatological episode was imminent, and seems to have considered his own role in the matter rather critical. Some of the more noteworthy discussions include a vivid definition of &quot;sinners&quot; as first-century Jews would have understood it, eschatological concepts behind Jesus' selection of twelve disciples, and a very impressive section on the kingdom sayings. He also unveils an interesting eschatological model from the so-called &quot;cleansing of the temple&quot; episode.Sanders' angle stems primarily from the school of Albert Schweitzer, a view currently under scrutiny by a group of [mostly] American scholars known as the Jesus Seminar. Many of the Seminar's publications specifically address arguments in this book. Nonetheless, Jesus and Judaism remains stable and unscathed. Too many issues presented by the Seminar are ambiguous and incomplete. They have yet to persuade this reader to their views of Jesus as a social reformer.The book is both comprehensive and involved. It reads quite smoothly but is heavyweight material. There are few, if any, blind assumptions; nothing is read into the texts. Instead, Sanders supports his arguments with a combination of extant archaeological documents of the period, canonical and extra-canonical texts, and sober scholarly reasoning. The book is best left for the serious biblical researcher. This reader believes that Jesus and Judaism will turn out to be one of the most important books of the 20th century on Jesus research.
A1BYDMYY2EDVRF	1	1	Manos: Hands of Fate makes all other B movies look like Oscar material. This thing is so bad, the viewer is nearly left feeling sorry for the people who made it. Home movies are easily better than this. In one sense, Manos seems worthy of some kind of reward because of its consistency in utter nonsense. So look no further. Manos WAS honored with a reward. It received the glory of resurrection by none other than the epitome of cinema sarcasm. And naturally the MST3K staff show no mercy on this flick.Pacing down the highway at about five miles per hour is a family of three on vacation. Joel opens the commentary: "This is the slowest car chase I've ever seen." Mixed up with his directions, Pop makes a wrong turn somewhere and the good guys end up lost in a desert where they happen upon some decrepit motel.The camera focuses on some weirdo standing on the porch known as Torgo. This guy is quite simply beyond any hope of description. He appears to be so low on the evolutionary scale that it is perhaps best to imagine him as a hillbilly without a brain. The character, played by John Reynolds, dons some sort of padding in his trouser legs to add excessive bulge to his knees. He exaggerates this appearance with a sloppy, staggering walk on his tiptoes in short, rapid steps. This ridiculous strut is accompanied by a comical music riff trying to sound like the Twilight Zone theme. I think the idea here was to give the impression that Torgo possessed the hind legs of a cloven-hoofed beast. This was, no doubt, to make him extra scary. Joel apparently interpreted his appearance differently: "Uh. . . Torgo, that is NOT where you're supposed to wear your Depends."Meanwhile down the road a piece, a couple of young hot teens are parked at the side of the highway in a sport coupe convertible, and working overtime on some serious tongue activity! Servo's immediate response is, "Whoa! Manos takes it up a notch!" Joel is equally startled: "Go Speed Racer!" Alas, a couple of cops drop by to clean up the moment and put the family values back into the movie. And boy can these cops act!Back at the ranch, Pop (also known as Mike) decides the family needs to hit the road, but he and his wife, Maggie, suddenly realize that their little daughter is missing! It turns out she's discovered a basement where Frank Zappa's twin brother and about six women are residing in suspended animation.Then the scary stuff unfolds. First, The Master and his wives wake up from their nap, and he decides that Maggie will be his next wife. But the ladies bicker over the fact that a little girl is involved. They decide to settle the matter with a cat fight in their nighties! To hell with the tonguing couple in the convertible; this scene is, as Crow observes, "Probably the reason the movie was made." Meanwhile, Torgo bonks Mike on the head because he wants Maggie for his wife too. This is Maggie's lucky day! The Master is not particularly pleased with that idea, however, so he orders Torgo killed during a sacrificial rite. The Master's wives respond by giving Torgo a massage. Poor Torgo ends up sacrificing one of his hands in a fire ritual, and then runs away with both legs working better than ever!Making sense so far?MST3K selected to capitalize on the character of Torgo. Mike Nelson makes his first appearance in this very episode as none other than Torgo the pizza delivery boy, complete with that ridiculous stagger and musical accompaniment. It's a riot.Also in this episode is a film called Hired. Occasionally, MST3K preceded their featured movie with a budget industrial film, otherwise known as a "short." This one is a customer service motivator by the Jim Handy Organization designed for Chevrolet sales representatives. It was made sometime in the early 1940s. The quality of Manos is so bad that Hired actually gives it a run for its money.For any newcomer, it is worth noting that MST3K is a cult program. It is alternative satire with a touch of slapstick. For those who relate to its approach, MST3K is splendid comedy. It's a nice escape from the excessive sitcom environment that bombards the airwaves. It is simple, direct, in-your-face humor. MST3K isn't for everyone, but if you're curious enough to look into it, this episode ranks among one of the favorites. Viewing under the influence should serve to enhance the ride.Enjoy!
A1BYDMYY2EDVRF	1	1	"Essential," "Indispensable," "Invaluable," "Crucial." Those are a few of the labels often applied to this remarkable book. Currently in its third edition, Maurice Hinson's "Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire" is still the most sought-after reference for essentially all solo piano music of significance. Outside professional private instruction and a reliable piano technician, every serious piano student needs three tools on hand: a piano, piano music, and this guide. Hinson's reputation as both an effective and productive musicologist is firmly established in this work.The book is structured into two primary sections. The main section, Part 1, is alphabetically categorized by composer. Each referenced work includes a list of available publications, their editors, and the composition's date if known. Hinson includes a brief yet vivid description of the style or character of a given piece and, in most cases, a comment or two on some of the technical requirements one can expect for preparatory purposes. The guide is also a reliable reference to books for further study of a given work. Both logic and common sense went into organizing the massive collection of data. The guide also proves sensibly formatted for sections of large volume by a single composer, such as the collections of Bach or Chopin, for example.Part 2 is an impressive reference to published anthologies, subdivided into four categories. The first category, "General," lists publications of character pieces, impressionistic works, and any number of &quot;Heinz 57&quot; types. There is a &quot;General: Contemporary&quot; section for twentieth century collections. In addition to Bart&oacute;k, Prokofieff, and others from the earlier years of the century, one can also find reference to works by Boulez, Kohlenz and Harbison, to name a few. The third category, coined "Tombeaux, Hommages," is a brief list of collections of works composed in honor of another composer. The fourth category, the largest of the four, is a comprehensive reference to piano collections by nationality. It is subdivided alphabetically.The book includes an appendix of historical recital programs by Rubinstein, Busoni and Gabrilowitsch. There is also an impressive group of indexes for referencing under different category types.The entire collection of works are broadly lumped into four technical grades. The labels are "Easy," "Intermediate (Int.)," "Moderately Difficult (M-D)," and "Difficult (D)." It may help the amateur, when focusing on technical problems, to limit the comparisons to other works of the same genre or by the same composer, rather than cross-comparing any two works that happen to have the same grade.For example, Franz Liszt's &quot;Transcendental Etudes&quot; is marked "D" for difficult; likewise Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti's &quot;Etudes for Piano&quot; is graded "D." Since the primary technical demands for these two works are as different from each other as the works themselves, the grade is really little more than a signal that both works will require extensive work and patience beyond most anything marked M-D. Naturally, the serious piano student will pursue further research for works of this magnitude anyway, but Hinson's commentary often provides key information for what lies ahead. In Liszt's etude collection, for instance, the player will confront "double-note tremolos," and a "melody with rapid tremolo accompaniment in the same hand." For Ligeti's set, the performer faces "polyrhythmic, simultaneous progressive layers of tempo" and a command in dynamics ranging between ffffffff and pppppppp. Hinson's carefully worded descriptions often prove crucial in matters such as this. It pays to note them.This massive project is both focused and thorough. Hinson has delivered a beneficial service for the serious piano explorer. Even casual browsing proves enlightening.One request for the next edition: since the "Tombeaux, Hommages" category is so small, and only a few homages happen to be in collections, perhaps a comprehensive list of all published piano homages would make a worthy addition. Sincere thanks from this aging amateur pianist and music-lover goes to Mr. Hinson, the publisher, and to all teachers and professionals involved in the making of this excellent handbook.
A1BYMOVKWKNT4C	0	0	Recollections of being a three year old? I do not think so. The author not only portrayed herself as a victim, but remains a victim. Through all of the disgusting, humiliating, neglectful things BOTH her parents put her through, she never said a word against them. Respect your mother and father.. PAH! Respect should be earned, and neither of them deserved one ounce of respect. You can buy a piano, but make your kids sleep on cardboard? You are able to, but will NOT work to look after your kids. The whole thing seemed to me to be just a story concocted for $$$, and has a vague connection to the actual events. When you know people who have genuinely experienced real hardship, it is hard to read the glorification of these despicable parents. I would not have finished the book, but it was chosen for a book club. I HATED every single page of it.
A1BYMOVKWKNT4C	1	1	After installing the software, the setting up of the devices was pretty easy. It even found devices I had lost the remotes for. This remote can be set for different "zones" or rooms, so you can walk from room to room, and use the same remote. Have not used the Omnilink aspect of it yet, but will let you know. The charging base is great, you always know where the remote is. It does look a little intimidating at first, but a great remote with a LOT of features. You can also set your lighting with it. Press one button after setting it up to dim the lights, turn the TV, DVD on, and start the movie. So far... in love with my Monster
A1BYMOVKWKNT4C	1	1	The equipment is SOLID. It feels like it will last a lifetime. Easy to put together. I was surprised to find neither of the DVDs that came with it, worked in a DVD player.Looking at the rebounder, one would think it is an easy exercise to do. Try five minutes, then decide. It really gives your lower abs and thighs a workout.I haven't done all the exercise types on the chart (comes with the equipment), but what I have do so far, certainly exercises everything that I want it to.I got some large furniture sliders to put under the feet of the frame, and when I exercise, I remove two to stop it sliding, and pop them back afterwards to easily slide the equipment out of the middle of the room.So far, I am thrilled with it.
A1BYOH5IJORQ2	1	1	This DVD is definitely intermediate level stuff. He starts with a quick review of the 5 basic scale patterns, pentatonic, blues, and diatonic, plus the related chords. If you've read Fretboard Logic this will be familiar. Then a quick review of which scales go with which chords. Nice. Then arpeggios and how to use them. Also nice. Then he puts theory in action by teaching some very nice country and blues licks, then some Brazilian and a pop tune with altered chords. Just a very pleasant DVD, full of good info and nice tunes. Mr Findlay has a very breezy teaching style. The licks work on electric guitar as well. Lots of info in a short time. One of the best guitar teaching DVDs I've seen. And the price is right.
A1BYOH5IJORQ2	0	0	Every smoothie came out lumpy, and with a bit of plastic aftertaste. I've had three blenders in the past. All could chop up almonds if you waited long enough, added a little juice, and tapped the sides. This thing has such a large and round jar with such small blades that it will just not reach every piece. Lumps and more lumps. I even tried sharpening the blades. The Krups turned almonds to powder in 10 seconds. This turnes almonds to small pieces in 2 minutes. So it makes a good alarm clock to wake the whole house. Even the banana was still lumpy. I read all these reviews and no one mentioned this problem. I'm definitely getting a different blender.
A1BYOH5IJORQ2	1	1	I've bought too many instructional DVDs over the years. This one finally has what I was looking for. If you have a basic knowledge of music theory Joe ( you can call him Joey) will show you how to actually use it. He's great natural teacher. He focuses entirely on the I vi ii V progression in the key of C (C, Amin, Dmin, G7). From there he starts substitutions, which were always a mystery to me. No heavy theory here, mostly: "this sounds right", lots of humor. For example he substitutes from Cmaj7 to Emin7, then to E7, then to Bflat13. With other substitutions for Amin and Dmin he ends up with that chromatic movement that sounds so funky, but I always wondered where it came from. He makes it so simple.The on screen tabs and chord diagrams are just right. I spent 3 hours taking notes and made my own booklet. Pause, or slow motion, and write it down. All the substitutions are clearly diagramed and explained. And all the chords are simple to finger as he says he doesn't like to work too hard. So he greatly simplifies all those confusing voicings. (Throw most of them out!) Then there's a really great section on how to play your scales in a way that's interesting and useful. Then he goes over two very cool running base lines, and explains how to comp with them . (He says the base line is more important than the chords, so he keeps the chords very simple.)The information just flows out from him like music did. He was a truly great teacher, and this DVD is 10 times more useful and enjoyable than any of the 30 others I've seen.
A1BYP1N0RZKOMY	0	0	Generally, I prefer to read reviews rather than to write them. But in this case, I am annoyed and frustrated because the barn came without the tiny crucial piece and I can't assemble the barn for my daughter. What a sheer disappointment. Since this was an Xmas gift, the gift was purchased way in advance of the 30-day return policy and now I'm stuck with these large bulky pieces that I can't put together. Worst of all, customer service at Reeves International are completely useless - they claim not to have a parts department and asked me to search out the merchant to make the claim. If I had purchased this from a store, returns would be simple...because I purchased off an online merchant (merchant is great, BTW), I'm pretty much out of options here. Maybe I can support the barn with a pair of chopsticks or something. Plus, you need an electric screwdriver to put this together.So when you get the product, make sure all of the pieces are together or else you'll be out of luck like me. Grrr.
A1BYP1N0RZKOMY	0	0	I received this product through Cuisinart's rebate after purchasing their coffeemaker DCC 2650 at Bloomingdale's. The coffeemaker was mediocre and I actually purchased an Aerobie aeropress in the end. But going back to the grinder, I'm glad that I spent zero dollars on the product and it worked okay during the first 10 grinds. The cup is very small and I had a large can of beans to grind.Afterwards, it was dead. Didn't even sputter and die, just went dead after using the grinder as directed. I suggest you spend the money on something else rather than this product. I've never had any bad experiences with Cuisinart before and is disappointed that this grinder would go so quickly. I'll just stick to grinding my beans at the local supermarket before bringing it home.
A1BYP1N0RZKOMY	1	1	For the past few years I have been searching for numerous of shampoos that can clean my greasy hair. After lots of trials, I finally discovered a method how to keep my hair clean for 2 days without looking like I dipped my head into deep fryer. For each wash, I alternate between 5-6 different brands and continually add or subtract different products every few months. Suave has proven to effectively clean my hair and leave no residue behind. It even washes out the dry shampoo I use in my hair to keep the grease at bay on days I don't have time to wash. For the price I paid, only 1.99, was well worth it and will be keep this as part of the haircare regimen I created.
A1BYQWUBX0AXPU	0	0	this player could be the best, has lots of functions, but after a couple months, the thing started having problems such as can't play songs, or it freezes up. Those occurred every other week or so, but now it doesn't let me add songs nor write any firmware. Called Samsung customer service and the supervisor said "we only sell you the product, the problem is yours not ours"
A1BYQWUBX0AXPU	0	0	I bought this mouse at non sale price and it is definitely not worth it. I was wondering how logitech has improved wireless signal since my first logitech mouse in the 90's, but it seems they haven't. My MX Revolution mouse hesitates/lags like crazy. Gaming is impossible! Sometimes the cursor would not even move for 30 minutes. I can't even web browse. The troubleshoot suggests procedures on how to disconnect and connect, but when I tried to connect the mouse back up, it never worked. It was dead as a solid brick. I had to reboot my windows xp. This could either be a defective mouse or being in existing proximity to another MX revolution mouse. Both computers have the newest updated Logitech software. The other computer's MX mouse is about 2 yards away and it had a very bad lag too. I wish it allowed you to choose your own channel or at least use the bluetooth technology. Logitech customer service blames it on LCD monitor. He said I can't use it with LCD monitors but only CRT's. He also says this mouse does not work around wireless routers or microwaves or wireless telephones. Why would I buy this mouse then if I can't use this near my PC? This is the last wireless mouse I'm buying from Logitech unles they improve their wireless technology. This product has led me to believe this company is all about refitting a worse than 90's mouse for profit.
A1BYQWUBX0AXPU	0	1	Made in Japan but...dead. Laptop does not even recognize it's plugged in. I lost my 6 hrs worth of work on my business trip due to this battery which I purchased directly from Sony. Sony told me these are meant to be replaced every year. Somehow my double A's last longer than this. This was also my back up battery, I've only used this twice.
A1BYQWUBX0AXPU	0	1	Alright so everything's corny. The story seemed rushed and very predictable. Typical conflicts and quotes you see from so many movies. You have computer animations mixed with power ranger effects. This movie is not worth the time. Somehow the main female character is so easy she'd kiss any guy within a day and the department of defense keeps shotguns in their drawers.
A1BYUF1UO1N4FF	1	1	With such intimate tone Marguerite Duras involves us in the story of her childhood. She, daughter of a poor French family in the colonies (South East Asia) has her first romantic experience with a rich Chinese man.Class, gender, ethnicity, uprootedness, relationships, all of that mingles to create a narrative that flows full of power and feeling. Both the nameless narratrice and her lover are outsiders in a country that is not really theirs, both share a moment and both have complex lives.I think anyone who has grown in a home full of conflicts and privations can easily identify with the feelings so passionately set to paper by the author. And anyone else can, too: such is the magic of her prose.The &Eacute;ditions de Minuit series is rather minimalistic: no prologue, no notes. None are needed.
A1BYUF1UO1N4FF	0	1	Colette Chiland admits she's a psychiatrist of the 'old school' in Europe. Which means her background is not medical, but in the humanities. In fact, her book is nothing but a philosophical/ethical analysis of transsexualism viewed as a problem stemming from social mores.Which is not the case, since a true understanding of 'gender dysphoria' requires a medical background.Books on the ethics of SRS and such were fairly common during the 70s. Several of those are revisited, and the sources cited by Dr. Chiland are all for the most part 30 years old or more. Her research is outdated because she does not want to take into account the more current, medical view of 'gender dysphoria' as something that has a biological basis.Some of the generalizations are almost laughable. For example, she talks about 'gender dysphoric boys' who draw two women: one like a good fairy, the other like an evil witch. According to her, one of the root causes of transsexualism in genetic males is such splitting of the mother image. Wanting to disappear the witch, they want to become the fairy.And that is not even the most farfetched bit.Even so, the book may have some value as a different view on the social implications of transition and such. I'd say it's an interesting read for anyone with a background in the humanities. Anyone familiar with the idea of a male phallocentric narrative as the core of modern social order will see whence the author is coming.Still, Dr. Chiland seems to come to the subject with an axe to grind, and although at times interesting, in the end the book is irrelevant to those to whom it is addressed: experts in the field and the transsexual men and women out there.PS: This book's cultural context is France or, more widely, continental Europe. Some of the references and names cited will be rather obscure to the American reader, and the ideas proposed by such names, unknown. Dr. Chiland has stretched the area covered by post-structuralist theory to what is now more properly treated by medicine, although in the end she clings to a dated essentialism where men are born men and will die men, and women are born to have children. Love and marriage are, for her, means to an end (having children); and transsexualism is a narcissistic disorder because it goes against such end.
A1BYV6JSF879V4	0	0	I purchased this based on the reviews and was very disappointed. Sound quality was horrible. Maybe I received a defective item. I'll be purchasing a Littman, hopefully those review are more accurate.
A1BYV6JSF879V4	1	1	Worked perfect for a concert in the park. Just big enough for 2 normal sized adults to be comfortable. If you need to fit any more than 2 adults and a small child you should order two. Folded nicely and was able to fit both in a small bag for transport.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	I've spent some days listening to the whole audio version of The Turner Diaries by Andrew Macdonald (real name: William Pierce). Fascinating! In chapter 6 Pierce wrote:/quote:But there is no way we can destroy the System without hurting many thousands of innocent people--no way. It is a cancer too deeply rooted in our flesh. And if we don't destroy the System before it destroys us--if we don't cut this cancer out of our living flesh--our whole race will die.We have gone over this before, and we are all completely convinced that what we did is justified, but it is still very hard to see our own people suffering so intensely because of our acts. It is because Americans have for so many years been unwilling to make unpleasant decisions that we are forced to make decisions now which are stern indeed.And is that not a key to the whole problem? The corruption of our people by the Jewish-liberal-democratic-equalitarian plague which afflicts us is more clearly manifested in our soft-mindedness, our unwillingness to recognize the harder realities of life, than in anything else.Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive worldview. Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile. It is the worldview of men who do not have the moral toughness, the spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge, pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.Nor should spiritually healthy men of our race even want the world to be that way, if it could be so. That is an alien, essentially Oriental approach to life, the worldview of slaves rather than of free men of the West. But it has permeated our whole society. Even those who do not consciously accept the liberal doctrines have been corrupted by them.Decade after decade the race problem in America has become worse. But the majority of those who wanted a solution, who wanted to preserve a White America, were never able to screw up the courage to look the obvious solutions in the face. All the liberals and the Jews had to do was begin screeching about "inhumanity" or "injustice" or "genocide," and most of our people who had been beating around the edges of a solution took to their heels like frightened rabbits. Because there was never a way to solve the race problem which would be "fair for everybody" or which everyone concerned could be politely persuaded into accepting without any fuss or unpleasantness, they kept trying to evade it, hoping that it would go away by itself. And the same has been true of the Jewish problem and the immigration problem and the overpopulation problem and the eugenics problem and a thousand related problems.Yes, the inability to face reality and make difficult decisions: that is the salient symptom of the liberal disease. Always trying to avoid a minor unpleasantness now, so that a major unpleasantness becomes unavoidable later, always evading any responsibility to the future--that is the way the liberal mind works. /end quote_____________________If you want to listen to Pierce himself reading this chapter, go to track 17 of the audio linked at the blog "The West's Darkest Hour" (search for first entry on William Pierce ).
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	0	1	How would we have felt if, as children, our father returned home with a boy of an alien ethnic group and force it into our bedroom as a new "brother"? How would we have felt if, after resenting this betrayal and picking on the unfortunate intruder--as children usually do--, our father sends us, not the intruder, to a boarding school?Forget every silly film you have seen to date: because that's how the real Wuthering Heights novel began.In his travels Mr. Earnshaw finds a homeless boy. Once more, forget every Hollywood image because the skin of this boy was similar of that of "a little lascar". Mr. Earnshaw decides to adopt him and name him "Heathcliff". Bront describes Heathcliff as "dark-skinned gypsy in aspect". Naturally, Mr. Earnshaw's legitimate son finds himself robbed of his father's affections and becomes bitterly jealous of the little lascar. (The poor boy was not even a half-bro or an illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw with a gypsy woman.)Every single Western critic of the novel seems to have omitted the central aspect of this drama. I would go so far as to suggest that, once the ethno-state is established Wuthering Heights will be one of our first classics to convey the tragedy of pushing, against the legitimate heir's will, someone of another race that after some time hostilely takes over the entire family estate and starts to hunt down key Anglo-Saxon characters in a life dedicated to revenge (gypsies are so good at that).Furthermore, the real Wuthering Heights is no love story at all. The 1939 adaptation with Lawrence Oliver is as detached from the original story as, say, Disney's Pinocchio from the original, and far more sinister, Carlo Collodi tale. Catherine and the gypsy are the polar opposite of heroine and hero. The first Catherine is precisely an early embodiment of the contemporary out-group altruism that has been destroying, and--if we fail to create an ethno-state--will finally destroy the West since we committed the astronomical blunder of empowering women.The drama of Wuthering Heights only ends when the gypsy dies at the end of the novel and the second Catherine can, at last, reclaim a life together with her first cousin.* * *I have just read this edition of Wuthering Heights, edited by Andy Hopkins and Jocelyn Potter (Penguin Readers, with Audio CD pack available and retold by Evelyn Attwood, first published by Penguin in 1999). I was shocked to see that, besides changing the syntax into modern English, it censored some phrases--with no editorial warning in my 2008 edition!I will only quote one of the key phrases that got censored. In chapter 5, after "I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors", this edition omitted the rest of the sentence:quote:"she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?" (online, e-book version of Wuthering Heights)./end quoteI am mad with the only available English edition for sell in downtown Mexico City because I had purchased it with the purpose of writing a review requested by Counter Currents Publishing. Now it seems that I cannot use the version that I read: a sugar-coated, politically correct edition. From the unsigned 2008 introduction of this Penguin Book:quote:They wanted to believe that evil came from the devil. They were not ready to read that the `normal' family values of pride and honour might be responsible for producing it./end quoteSo Penguin Books, which used to be a pillar of English literature when I was younger, now blames normal family values, not the gypsy, for the family tragedy of Wuthering Heights!Next time you purchase a Penguin Book make sure that it is the original, unabridged, unedited version: which in a second-hand bookstore in the States should be far cheaper that just printing the e-book.* * *By the way, after the gypsy takes over the family estate and money, I constantly asked himself, Why don't they just kill the beaner?We cannot fathom Bronte's heart. Perhaps she listened a similar story and only dramatized it. The current interpretation in decades of filming the novel, that it is a love story, is just one possible interpretation.My main field of interest used to be child abuse. In the middle 19th century the subject of child abuse could only be approached peripherally, and only in novel form, e.g., a Mr. Earnshaw loving a gypsy much more than his legitimate son. All of the subsequent drama develops from this single, grotesque blunder. And Mr. Earnshaw's fatal blunder is mere prologue for the continuing blundering of an English family that never put a stop to the abusive gypsy.That the original novel is no love story in the common romantic sense is easily seen when taking into account the story of the second Catherine, which films like the one with Lawrence Oliver omitted completely.In the real story the gypsy continues to destroy the families even after the first Catherine, whom the gypsy loved and hated, dies. But what kind of love is that? It's a story of revenge and of the clash between two different psychoclasses. Throughout my recent reading of WH I could never avoid the feeling of outrage about how the English families in the story never wrapped their heads for a final solution to the gypsy problem.Nonetheless, HW is not a tragedy. In Greek tragedies the problem cannot be solved. In dramas it finally gets solved. As I said, in WH the drama only ends when the gypsy dies and the second Catherine reclaims her life, almost ruined by him, and rescues his first cousin from a mental life of relentless child abuse.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	Kendall can be understood within the movement of white nationalism: the dream to create a sanctuary to avoid race extinction. Like the whites living in Mars in Hold Back This Day, in real life white nationalists only have one agenda item: whites living normally among whites in a white country under white control. In times of massive immigration into the West, if the white people can't create an ethno-state... just read this book and see what will happen in the 22nd century. This novel is about the coming extinction of the white race, a text that could easily be used as a draft for the most fascinating movie script of the 21st century.Hold Back This Day really deserves to reach the big screen.Old Stormfront review:SynopsisHold Back This Day examines the life of the protagonist, Jeff Huxton, a civil servant who functions as principal of a government school in what was formerly South Africa (the sovereign nations of the planet have ceased to exist as such in Kendall's 22nd century).In a global society of multi-hued brown, Huxton is an anomaly, a man of "sandy-gray hair," "blue eyes and pale complexion." Race or lack thereof, is not the only uniformity on this Earth of 19 billion humans. The planet itself is ruled from Beijing by one hedonistic, cosmopolitan bureaucracy. This is "World Gov," the omnipresent and seemingly omnipotent ruler which is so reminiscent of "Oceania" and "Big Brother" in George Orwell's 1984.At this time, the Whites of Earth have been all but obliterated--primarily through government-mandated miscegenation but also as a result of mass executions following the Unification, a cataclysmic moment when the non-whites of the world were let loose to ravage and annihilate their technologically and intellectually superior brethren of European descent.The result: Slavery in the name of freedom, monoculture in the name of diversity, perpetual famine in a gluttonous world, and technological stagnation--even regression--as a consequence of the unavoidable dumbing-down of global intellect.To whom are the people slaves? To World Gov, of course! Despite their lofty rhetoric concerning "brotherhood" and "equality," the leaders of the world actually demand a state of perpetual subservience from the global populace. They constitute an elite, and they stop at nothing to protect their status atop the swarm of starving mongrels.Jeff Huxton, "skoolplex administrator," has lived his entire life in this chaos. In his youth, he learned of the fallibility of the government. Nevertheless, any flickering doubts concerning World Gov's righteousness are of no consequence: His indoctrination has been complete. To him, everything is justified in the pursuit of "cultural diversity."Huxton is reviled by his raceless contemporaries, and he likely would die as he lives but for one person, his son Adam. Like his father, Adam is of pure blood--wholly of European descent. He is ostracized at school, and he can find no satisfaction at home. Gradually, Adam finds the sense of belonging for which he yearns, but it places him and his father in extraordinary danger. Adam has found his own kind, not lost to the sands of time, but alive--on Mars.(C.T.'s interpolated note: The climax at Mars is so exciting that I am tempted to make a film career only to take it to the silver screen. Sorry, I won't add a spoiler here discussing the climax --just read it!)What is that message?The White Race is on a collision course with disaster. Regardless of the causes, action must be taken now or all may be lost. Only a sci-fi plot twist saves Whites in Kendall's book. The reader should not expect such Providence in reality.This book challenges the mindless treason of egalitarianism, which is worshipped (and increasingly demanded by statute) in every college, government institution, and most churches in the United States. Is it any wonder Kendall's book wasn't published by the masters of the media, who are directly responsible for the distribution of such filth?Hold Back This Day is required reading for those who wish to peer into the foreseeable future. It comes in under the radar screen of political correctness, and may be a dangerous book to those who seek to establish the tyranny portrayed between its covers.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	The publication of The History of Childhood in 1974 marks the turning point in the field that deMause created. Putting aside the idealizations of previous historians, the book examines for the first time the history of Western childhood. In the new deMausean paradigm the force of the change is neither technology nor the economy, but the interactions between parents and children.The initial paragraphs became so famous in psychohistory that they have being quoted extensively:Quote:The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken. The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of child care, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized, and sexually abused. It is our task here to see how much of this childhood history can be recaptured from the evidence that remains to us.That this pattern has not previously been noticed by historians is because serious history has long been considered a record of public not private events. Historians have concentrated so much on the noisy sand-box of history, with its fantastic castles and magnificent battles, that they have generally ignored what is going on in the homes around the playground. And where historians usually look to the sandbox battles of yesterday for the causes of those of today, we instead ask how each generation of parents and children creates those issues which are later acted out in the arena of public life./end quoteDeMause has no illusions. Like Thomas Kuhn, he knows perfectly well that paradigm revolutions are achieved gradually while the defenders of the old paradigm die and are replaced by new individuals. "If childhood history and psychohistory mean anything,", writes deMause, "they mean reversing most of the causal arrows used by historians to date." In other words, the way of seeing the world in the humanities and in social sciences is upside down, and psychohistory places our feet back on the ground. The relations between parents and children have determined the social, political and economic aspects in all civilizations of the world. In contrast to the findings of Darwin about the organism and its environment, in Homo sapiens the external world does not mold future developments so definitively as the intergenerational emergency of empathy does.In a nutshell, the main finding of psychohistory is that academic history fails to recognize the profound role that the love of the parents for their children plays in the future developments of mankind.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	InRC Series Bundle: The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Routledge Classics)philosopher of science Karl Popper tells us that the difference between science and pseudosciences lies in the power of refutability of a hypothesis. Despite its academic, governmental and impressive financial backing in the private sector, psychiatry does not rest on a body of discoveries experimentally falsifiable or refutable. In fact, the central entity in psychiatry, the concept of mental illness--say "schizophrenia"--cannot be put forward as a falsifiable or refutable hypothesis.Let us consider the claim that psychiatrists use the drugs called neuroleptics to restore the brain chemical imbalance of a schizophrenic. A Popperian would immediately ask the questions: (1) What is exactly a brain chemical imbalance? (2) How is this neurological condition recognized among those who you call schizophrenics and which lab tests are used to diagnose it? (3) Which evidence can you present to explain that the chemical imbalance of the so-called schizophrenic has been balanced--or has not been balanced--as a result of taking the neuroleptic?Before these questions the psychiatrist answers in such a way that he who is unfamiliar with the logic of scientific discovery will have great difficulties in detecting a trick. For instance, Nancy Andreasen, a president of the American Psychiatry Association, has acknowledged that there have not been found biochemical imbalances in those diagnosed with a mental illness and that there is no laboratory test that determines who is mentally ill and who is not. That is to say, Andreasen is recognizing that her profession is incapable of responding to the second and third questions above. How, then, does Andreasen and her colleagues have convinced themselves that neuroleptics restore to balance the "chemically unbalanced" brains of schizophrenics? Furthermore, why does Andreasen have stated so confidently at the beginning of the section inBrave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genomethat addresses the question of what causes schizophrenia that the disorder "is not a disease that parents cause"?Speaking in Popperian terms the answer is: by contriving a non-falsifiable or irrefutable hypothesis. In contrast to neurologists, who can demonstrate the physiopathology, histopathology or the presence of pathogen microorganisms, Andreasen and other psychiatrists recognize that they cannot demonstrate these biological markers (faulty genes or biochemical imbalances) that they postulate in the major disorders classified in the fourth edition of theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition (Text Revision), the DSM-IV. If they could do it, psychiatry as a specialty would have disappeared and its body of knowledge merged in neurological science. What psychiatrists do is to state that after almost a century of research in, for instance, schizophrenia, the medical etiology of the "disease" is still "unknown," and they claim the same of many others DSM-IV behaviors. As Thomas Szasz has observed, in real medical science physicians observe the pathological alterations in the organs, tissue and cells as well as the microbial invasions, and the naming of the disease comes only after that. Psychiatry inverts the sequence. First it baptizes a purported illness, be it schizophrenia or any other, and the existence of a biological marker is never discovered, though it is dogmatically postulated. A postulate is a proposition that is accepted without proof. Only by postulating that these disorders are basically genetic and that the environment merely plays a "triggering" role can psychiatrists justify to treat them by physical means. But if neuroses and psychoses are caused by parental abuse, to treat them with drugs, electroshock or lobotomy only "re-victimizes" the victim.In the 1930s, 40s, 50s and 60s tens of thousands of lobotomies were performed in the United States, but since the advent of neuroleptics only about two hundred chirurgical lobotomies are performed each year in the world. About 100,000 people are being electro-shocked every year in the United States alone, many against their will. North America consumes about 90 per cent of the world's Ritalin for American and Canadian children. Many parents, teachers, politicians, physicians and almost all psychiatrists believe in these "medical model" treatments for unwanted behaviors in children and teenagers.On the other hand, the "trauma model" is an expression that appears in the writings of non-biological psychiatrists such as Colin Ross. Professionals who work in the model of trauma try to understand neurosis and even psychosis as an injury to the inner self inflicted by abusive parents during their childhood. The psyche of a child is very vulnerable to persistent abuse while in the process of ego formation. Although some books of the proponents of the old existential and "schizophrenogenic" mother are still in print, today the model is best explained in the case-stories writings of survivors of both, extremely abusive parenting and biological psychiatry, such as John Modrow. In this moving and yet scholarly autobiography, John Modrow maintains that an all-out emotional attack by his parents caused a psychotic crisis in his adolescence. His refutations of biopsychiatry tenets are clearer for the causal reader than the scholarly books by the professionals themselves.Despite claims to the contrary, the trauma model of psychosis is still alive. In this century two academic books were released on the subject, but instead of mentioning them I'd recommend Modrow's fascinating approach to the same subject: the best available book to understand "schizophrenia".
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	These days I've been listening to the magnificent audio version of David Duke's 736-page book My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding. It is infinitely better than the recently publishedSuicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?by Pat Buchanan for the simple reason that Pat avoids the Jewish Question.I've been advertising Michael O'Meara'sToward the White Republicas the best philosophical pamphlet in white nationalism. But the target audience of O'Meara slim book are those nationalists who already know that race matters. On the other hand, the target of Duke's treatise are the common whites completely clueless about race and how the present system is the biggest threat to the existence white people.While the print version of My Awakening has received many favorable reviews at Amazon, I find it shocking that it is no longer available from here. However, it still can be purchased directly from Duke's webpage where nine sample chapters can be read for free.I highly recommend Duke's book. The more recent audio version has been taped with Duke's own voice. Racially conscious people could send links of the audio version of My Awakening to their friends and acquaintances who might be open to our message. If a single audio clip of My Awakening is listened each day, the whole book is finished in month and a half.The collapse of the dollar might be around the corner. All Caucasians, whether Nordic or Mediterranean, ought to know the most elemental ABC of our nature, and the most threatening social realities, before "it" hits the fan.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	Brutally honest autobiographical confessions are stronger, and more important, than plain literature (plays, novels, poetry, etc.).Zweig seems to have started his vocation as a profound biographer precisely with a tremendous autobiographical confession.This is a great book, perhaps the best book Zweig wrote, and confirms my mission that the genre of total autobiography must be born: the true psychology.
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	Rome, centuries ago..In the vast and important Greek and Roman literature from which we still live, there are just a few novelists. Maybe for an overwhelming majority of illiterates it would be much more affordable the theater, which is enough to listen, that the written narrative which must be read. The same was true of poetry and the rhapsodies recited in public.The fact is that in Greece there are only few examples of novels, apart fromDaphnis and Chloe (Oxford World's Classics), and from the Romans only Apuleius and Petronius, whose work we offer here.It appears that, at the time, the Satyricon enjoyed considerable popular success, for both Tacitus and Quintilian commented it in their manuscripts, although it is apparent that neither knew it directly, only from hearsay. It is likely that they did not grant it much literary value because its style and form collided with all the concepts in vogue.However, the Satyricon was not lost and copies were kept in the Middle Ages, while jealously concealed because of its subject matter [pederasty] and for being the work of a pagan. The work continued to be ignored by the public to the point that only scholars knew its title, but believed it was lost.Therefore, a scandal broke when, in 1664, appeared the first edition of Pierre Petit.Soon after, the Satyricon was translated into several languages, including ours, with such success that has made it one of the great bestsellers in history. There were those who sought to take advantage that the work is incomplete, rewriting it to their liking. It was easy nevertheless to expose them.Presumably, however, the author would not work at top speed like if we should go to a literary prize. He seems to have devoted years to this task. Do not forget that what is now known are only fragments of the original, estimated in twenty books. He might have started writing when Caligula reigned and Nero followed, to see the publication during the reign of the next emperor. It can be no coincidence that the book mentions contemporary events known to all, or that the author considered worth mentioning many names.This is a job too conscientious not to be the work of a professional. Moreover, the action does not take place in Rome, but in the provinces and almost none of the men are Latins. It seems as if the author had had an interest in showing the reality of the empire, a reality ignored in the capital.The novel consists merely of the travel story of Encolpius and his servant Gitone through different locations. The incidents, sometimes unrelated, their adventures and the people they encounter are the text of the Satyricon, which lacks a plot as was the style of the epoch. We could actually say that it consists of countless short stories of the two protagonists. This technique influenced many centuries later the books of chivalry, the picaresque and evenDon Quixote (Penguin Classics). Throughout many incidents the author reveals us an extraordinary real view of the life in the Roman provinces, although tinged with irony.Petronius simply tells us what he saw. In a way, his novel was an approach to realism, leaving aside the epic tone of the tragedies to focus on current issues, as Aristophanes did in Greece. And that was the pattern followed by Petronius. There is a huge difference between his style and that of other contemporary writers.Poets, despite their undoubted genius, are pompous and in the tragedies the dialogues are extremely emphatic. Petronius by contrast, remains accessible to everyone. He expressed himself in a conversational tone, which justifies the use of a first person that conveys the feeling that someone is telling us a live tale. That's why today we can read his Satyricon with the same interest of his times and nothing of its freshness is lost.Writing is, in a sense, a childbirth with the same joys and suffering. Both things must have accompanied Petronius in this trip with Encolpius and Gitone through the decline of Rome.(by Jacinto Leon Ignacio)
A1BYZLAVNRJVY7	1	1	I've just read the second book of Professor Kevin MacDonald's study on Jewry, and I must say that it is my favorite book of his trilogy, that I read within a timeframe of two-and-a-half years.To me, the moral of Separation and its Discontents (hereafter SAID) is that the current decline of the West was caused because the white man did not replace, in due time, the collectivism of the Catholic Church--Christendom was basically immune to Jewish subversion--with another collectivist strategy, like the one in National Socialist Germany.The reading of SAID made me discover that the critique of universalism and individualism predates the blogs that awakened me in the last few years. MacDonald wrote:Quote:Western societies, unlike prototypical Jewish cultures, do not have a primitive concern with racial purity. Rather, concern about racial purity emerges only in the late stages of Jewish-gentile group conflict...Despite a great deal of commonality among Western anti-Semitic movements [i.e., Christianity and NS], there was a great difference between the universalistic, assimilatory tendencies of traditional Western Christianity and the exclusivistic, racialist program of National Socialism. Indeed, we have seen that beginning in the 19th century an important aspect of German anti-Semitic ideology was a criticism of Western universalism and the development of peculiarly German conceptions of Christianity. A critical component of official National Socialist ideology, as represented in the thought of Alfred Rosenberg, was the idea that "the twin forces of disintegration, namely universalism and individualism, act in perpetual conflict with the Germanic concept of race." In this regard, National Socialism was indeed profoundly anti-Western. In rejecting both universalism and individualism, National Socialism resembled, much more closely than did medieval Western collectivist Christianity, its mirror image rival, Judaism. [page 196]/end quoteIn a previous chapter MacDonald had written:Quote:We shall see that with the rise of the National Socialist movement in Germany, the universalist themes of Western Christianity were completely overthrown in favor of a full-blown racialist ideology of the ingroup. In Chapter 5 I will argue that National Socialism is a true mirror-image of Judaism. Not surprisingly, it was also the most dangerous enemy that Judaism has confronted in its entire existence. [page 133]/end quoteIf MacDonald is right, and I believe he is, this alone demonstrates that even white nationalists are behaving, to use James Bowery's term, like "extended phenotypes" of Jews, especially the Anglo-Saxons. In fact, I believe that if the white race goes extinct, Anglo-Saxons will be blamed by the surviving Chinese or Muslim historians in a future that views the Germanic movement as Europe's last chance to win her centuries-old battle against Jewry.Just one example. In a 2010 open thread on Hitler at Occidental Dissent (excerpts here) some white nationalists were calling Hitler a "beast" and claimed that their founding fathers were a "raging festival of awesome" superiority compared to Nazism. This ignores that the American Constitution mandates individualism, egalitarianism and a liberty with economic interests over racial interests. Those people who called Hitler a "beast" in his birthday added that Occidental Dissent, which is not a neonazi site, "is disgraced by his picture and a posting saluting him."Such commenters are totally unaware of the fact that the Allied forces committed more serious crimes before and after the Second World War than those attributed to the Nazis during the heat of war. This is why I will never tire of repeating that, before any serious discussion of white interests can even take place one should readHellstorm: The Death Of Nazi Germany, 1944-1947, the very first book of my list in "The West's Darkest Hour". It makes absolutely no sense trying to discuss our current woes if even white nationalists are plugged in the matrix of Jew-controlled media and the postwar narrative of the academia. By siding the current narrative about Germany, they completely ignore the most elemental facts of our history.Unlike the common Anglo-Saxon, only by understanding the Jewish problem, and the ways that the Germans reacted against it in the century when we were born, it is possible to comprehend the current mess. One of the most fascinating hypothesis advanced in SAID provides much food for thought. MacDonald wrote, "I propose that the Christian church in late antiquity was in its very essence the embodiment of a powerful anti-Semitic movement..." (page 112).This is something I had never heard of, and reminds me my first readings of psychohistory and Lloyd deMause's insights on why the Christ archetype galvanized the population of the ancient world, although MacDonald's hypothesis is totally distinct and is presented from an altogether distant point of view. But after digesting what both deMause and MacDonald say, for the first time I feel I am starting to comprehend facets of Christianity that would have never occurred to me from a conventional reading to history. If MacDonald is right, the Roman Catholic Church was the earliest attempt toward a type of society that we may call collectivism for European-derived peoples.Although Christianity always held universalist ideals at its core, it nonetheless fulfilled its role of impeding (like the Muslim nations) that Judaism became a destructive force for the indigenous culture of the late Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages.One of the facts that I learnt in SAID is that most restrictions enacted against the Jews, initiated in the period from Eusebius to Justinian, were still active throughout Christendom until the French Revolution hit the continent with all its fury. It was precisely the so-called "Enlightenment" what inspired the founding fathers of the United States of America. And contrary to those "white nationalists" who insult Hitler and the movement he created, the mortal sin of the French Revolution--the emancipation of Jewry--was not properly atoned in Europe until the arrival of a specifically racial ideology. Alas, the traitors, the Judaized Anglo-Saxons, did everything in their power to obliterate a nascent, competing worldview. The 20th century should have been the German century, not the Jewish century!But not only Nazi Germany has been demonized in the public mind. The Inquisition is widely seen as a black page in the history of the Church even by the most Catholic individuals that I know. In contrast to the popular view, MacDonald presents us with a radical reevaluation of what was precisely the role of the Inquisition. On page 147 he states: "I here develop the view that the Spanish Inquisition was fundamentally an authoritarian, collectivist, and exclusionary movement that resulted from resource and reproductive competition with Jews, and particularly crypto-Jews posing as Christians."Pace Alex Linder and other pro-white libertarians, collectivism is exactly what we need, though at present it does not has to be necessarily Christian or even religious. In my opinion, in order to defeat the tribe a revaluation of the collectivist movement that thrived in Germany when my parents were kids must be seriously considered.While reading SAID I could not escape the thought, as I wrote in a notebook, that "whites are brutes" because "unlike the Jews and with the exception of William Pierce and Arthur Kemp, very few have a notion of who we are" (the title of Pierce's book). And I added that I had seen a television program featuring New York Hassidic Jews celebrating, in one of their holydays, their victory over the ancient Greeks who tried to assimilate them. I wrote: "When do we celebrate the victory of Antiochus IV over the Jews, or Titus's conquest of Jerusalem?We cannot celebrate these victories precisely for the reason that both Kemp and Pierce explained so well: neither the Greeks nor the Romans exist today. (And incidentally, what about celebrating the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492?) What we call contemporary Greeks or Romans are the product of centuries of blood mixing that devalued not only the genotype of the original Indo-European population, but their extended phenotype as well: the Greco-Roman ethos and the pagan, classical mythology. Those Greeks and Romans who embraced Christianity were a totally different breed compared to the pure Aryans of Sparta or the austere Romans of the pre-imperial Republic.MacDonald himself acknowledges on page 190 that "the Jews have continued as a creative race into the present, while the Greeks gradually merged with the barbarians and lost their distinctiveness--a point remarkably similar to Chamberlain's `chaos of peoples' in which the decline of the ancient world is attributed to loss of racial purity." Conversely, I would say that since the Jews have conserved their genotype almost intact throughout the millennia they are able to celebrate their Maccabean revolt... in New York as if it was yesterday! In other words, had we Meditarraneans preserved our genes intact, we might still be celebrating Antiochus' victories over the tribe. Or at least if we knew our history with the same passion that Jews know theirs, we might still be celebrating the fall of the temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD, or the more recent expulsion of the tribe from the Iberian peninsula.What conventional historians ignore is that, once the Church lost its power to sell whites a peculiar narrative after the late 18th and early 19th centuries, our overwhelming individualism put us at the mercy of a collectivist tribe. Fortunately, since the dollar will crash and divine justice will finally befall upon the treasonous individualists that empowered the tribe and murdered their ancestors, there is hope that some of us will lean towards White Zionism in a post-crashed world. On page 10 MacDonald says that "in congruence with the results of social identity research, anti-Semitism is expected to be most prominent among those most in competition with the Jews and during times of economic crisis..."I hope he is right, and although most fans of MacDonald treasureThe Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movementsas their favorite of the trilogy, I like SAID most because, despite the crime of the age committed by the Allies, there will still be one last chance for the white peoples to reclaim their civilization against the alien invasion. SAID may help us to understand why white collectivism could be the way to salvation.
A1BZ8L14S0420Y	0	1	I own the book with this ISBN and it is a Barnes and Noble exact reprint of the Henry Gray F.R.S.(!) Anatomy of 1901.It is the 15th edition printed originally in 1901.There are no photos only black and white drawings(19th century style) and lots of writing ,much more writing than illustrations.
A1BZDRFZSY6PWQ	1	1	I was so wrong. What a wonderful show. Great acting, awsome plots and surprising turns. Disregarged my previous review. I LOVE THIS SHOW!
A1BZDRFZSY6PWQ	1	1	Wow, was I wrong about this show. It's tightly written, well acted and amazing story. Possibly the best science fiction show I've yet seen!!!!!!!!!
A1BZDRFZSY6PWQ	0	0	This book is terrible. Useless talk about&quot;The inner child&quot; and extremely poor writting mar this so-called self help book. Help yourself, don't read it
A1BZDRFZSY6PWQ	1	0	I was very wrong about this show and have tried to edit the review I posted earlier, but amazon doesn't seem to let me do it.Very smartly written show fun, scary and involving. Nothing else like it on tv. It's a shame it was cancelled. 6 stars
A1BZEYUXFBI340	0	0	Nirvana's "In Bloom" was the last single to be taken fromNevermind, and it was rather hastily put together. The "In Bloom" single includes the title track of course, but also two live tracks that have no real redeeming quality to them compared to their studio counter-parts. There as far better studio versions of the live tracks "Polly" and "Sliver", and truly, it is not worth the money to purchase this single unless you are trying to complete your single collection.
A1BZEYUXFBI340	1	1	For those who have never heard of the band Miracle legion, they are a lost gem from the late 80's and the mid 90's, with a garage band-meets-REM feel to them. They became a cult-classic when their music was featured in the hit 90's Nickelodeon show "The Adventures of Pete & Pete", changing their band name to 'Polaris' for the show.On to the album itself; Surprise, Surprise, Surprise is Miracle Legion's first full length album, and it is a real lost gem from your big brother's vinyl collection. The album sounds like a folky mix of REM, with a suburban attitude. With harmonicas, some string arrangements, and some laid back lyrics about your brother mowing the lawn, this album brings back those childhood memories from those lazy Summer afternoons of yore. The album is in no way simplistic, the songwriting is incredible and the arrangements and exotic instruments on the album are astounding to hear, especially from the debut album.There are many tracks that stand out, and echo a bit of the work they would be working on under the Polaris moniker years later. Most notable are "Mr. Mingo", "All For The Best", "Storyteller", and "Crooked Path". But I would most definitely recommend purchasing the entire album. The album captures the suburban storytelling of Maricle Legion more than one or two tracks ever could. Plus, you also get a bonus track! Very cool!So if you want to take a trip back to your early 90's neighborhood and the memories your had there, grab the old record player from the attic, raid your big brother's vinyl collection, and put on Surprise, Surprise, Surprise.
A1BZEYUXFBI340	1	1	I was browsing Amazon, looking for a CD release of Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom" to add to my collection of CD's. And as luck would have it, I discovered this limited edition LP+CD combo. I immediately purchased it, and I was not let down at all!For those who are fans of Robert Wyatt, but haven't heard this album: get it. This is one of his most essential releases. And for those who have never heard of Robert Wyatt but are curious about his music, he has a neat mix of free form jazz, rock and some folk elements. This album in particular is very slow but at the same time very wild.The album itself comes with the LP within the original 1974 album cover (the black and white pencil drawing), and CD itself is also in a reproduction of the 1974 album release but in a small card-stock sleeve. The album includes track listings on the back covers and lyrics on the inner sleeve of the LP. This is a MUST BUY for those who are scoping for either a CD or a vinyl release of Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom". Feed both your mp3 player with tracks from the CD and feed your turntable with the tracks from the always classic vinyl.

A1BZHVUHARTXS6	0	0	Love Marilyn and was happy to get this movie collection - but not happy to learn - unfortunately after I had opened the package - that everything is subtitled in Korean. Pretty sure I would not have bought it had that been disclosed in the description. Seems like a fairly material thing to omit, but because they are DVDs there is a problem with returning them. Buyer beware. Shame on Amazon for an inaccurate description!
A1BZHVUHARTXS6	1	1	Assembly was not difficult and the machine seems nice and solid. Being used daily by a 200 pound man and 140 pound woman and seems good for both of us. Very pleased with it.
A1BZRQHN86T5VT	0	1	I purchased this game because it came with a remote which I needed for my Wii & it was only a little bit more $$s than the remote by itself. The game is great for beginner who have nevered play with the Wii before as it teaches you how to move & operate the remote. It is done in game formats that make it interesting to do the drills. It is very simple with easy games & movements, however, you will lose interest in it very quickly.
A1BZRQHN86T5VT	1	1	I love my Wii. I have never owned any video game player before & thought they were too hard to understand. Wii is fun & simply to play. Hours of fun. My neighbors have a Wii & we get together with all of our remotes & play together. Great entertainment no matter what age you are.
A1BZRQHN86T5VT	1	1	If you like The Big Bang Theory, this DVD is for you. I own Seasons 1 - 5 & love the series.
A1C01PG8KUJ910	0	0	Bought this for my daughter-in-law, who is from Japan. She was excited to be able to grow fresh Japanese herbs indoors. Unfortunately, a couple of the pods never sprouted, and the others that did took such a long time and ultimately ended up dying shortly after coming up. I have purchased other seed kits from Aerogrow and have had great success. This one was a dud. After the fact, I did some research and found that others had marginal success, so not sure if it was something we did, or just a bad batch of seeds. Amazon was great about refunding the full purchase price, and I thought about purchasing another to see if we would have better luck, but decided against it based on the few reviews I read. Maybe others will have better luck.
A1C04ZLQEHQE4T	1	1	This line of Cuisinart pans is proving a great value. I wanted the nicer stuff and even though I may like the American Kitchen mid-line better(a really attractive and well-constructed pan, MADE in WI,USA!), I LIKE these pans. Well constructed, good even heat over gas and the weight makes for easy handling. Overall, pleased as punch. Read the instructions and bon appetit!
A1C04ZLQEHQE4T	1	0	This pan is another winner! Only giving 4 stars simply because I had to return the first one received. After one use of simply boiling edamame, some sort of 'rust' looking spots appeared on the interior base of the pan. I scrubbed by hand to no avail. I couldn't even feel the marks to the touch, but they remained. A quick exchange online and I had the new pan before even getting the first sent back! UPS finally arrived for pick-up on third try and the exchange is done!I used the new pan and all is well! Really can say enough about these pans...great quality(forgiving the fluke above) and even better value! Not for commercial kitchens I assure you, but great for the sensible consumer.Update...after three weeks still pleased as punch w these pans!
A1C04ZLQEHQE4T	1	1	Just received this knife. Initial satisfaction...HIGH for price and quality. I really like the size as it seems bigger than advertised. As I have smaller hands this makes a better fit than a 10" or 12". Will update review in good time.
A1C04ZLQEHQE4T	1	1	Yeah, its a teakettle, but this one is awesome for its small size and nifty look. The handle is cheap, but so far has stuck in one spot and not moved...perfect. Luv it.
A1C0HIMAFCP0TD	0	0	One good song Stand Up the song with chingy is mediocre at best everything else is garbage
A1C0IER56HKV5V	1	1	What can i say! if u don't own this cd, frankly, you are making a big mistake 'cos this cd is fantastic! Although there has only been three single releases, this cd can offer so much to every music fan out there. i believe the best songs to be 'californication' &amp; 'easily'. So please go &amp; buy this cd, you wont regret it!
A1C0IER56HKV5V	1	1	The Albums &quot;Life thru a lens&quot; and &quot;i've been expecting you&quot; which robbie has released in britain are both fantastic so the combination of the two makes for an absolute beauty of an album. He has already released 9 singles from this album in britain and will have a new album out in September. Robbie Williams ia a good singer but has unbelievable character and his uniqueness will ensure that he will be in the music business for many years to come - if he can be bothered that is! This cd is fantastic - end of story!
A1C0IER56HKV5V	1	1	I'm from the UK so i have the 2 bsb albums that this was made from, and i have to say, although this cd is very good, it could have been a lot better if they had put different songs from the two albums released in europe on it! such as: &quot;Thats the way i like it&quot;, &quot;Roll with it&quot; &amp; &quot;I wanna be with you&quot;. However, despit this the cd is still very good with great songs like: &quot;Everybody&quot;, &quot;Hey Mr.DJ&quot;, Anywhere for you&quot; &amp; &quot;Get Down&quot;. Take my advice and buy this cd!Will Richardson
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	0	I'm a big fan of paranormal romances, but this one fell flat. The main character, Emerald O'Brien, a single mother who owns a tea room and can see ghosts, SOUNDS interesting, but isn't. Her character is just too much single-Mom dealing with kids with growing pains, and not enough mystery-solving psychic. The other characters aren't well-developed or fully-formed, and I couldn't develop any real interest -- or belief -- in any of them. The Plot didn't hold my interest either. I think the author tried to do too many things in one story and, as a result, didn't do any of them very well.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	When I first read other reviews of The Black Dagger Brotherhood series, I didn't think I'd like them; they sounded like too many other paranormal romances. Boy, was I wrong! I've read the entire series, and this one, featuring Zsadist, the scarred, tortured, former blood slave, was a doozie! His character is scary and sympathetic at the same time; a frightening, angry vampire whose savage appearance hides a noble soul not entirely corrupted. His relationship with the beautiful Bella is his one hope for redemption.Every author has a different take on the nature of vampires, and I really enjoy J.R. Ward's depiction of The Black Dagger Brotherhood, although not much attention has been given to what she calls "civilian" vampires, i.e. all non-Black Dagger Brotherhood vampires. I would have liked to learn more about these other, less powerful characters.The stories revolve around the Brotherhood's ongoing war with the "lessers", undead slayers dedicated to the eradication of all vampires, as well as wonderfully written love stories with just enough sex to keep readers turning the pages. Thoroughly enjoyable escapist reading!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	"The Illusionist" is a wonderful surprise! It was much better than I expected; I don't understand why the reviews didn't reflect the fantastic film-making we're treated to here. The entire cast is great; Edward Norton does his usual excellent job as Eisenheim the Illusionist; Paul Giamatti is superb as the Police Captain assigned to investigate Eisenheim; Jessica Biel gives a lovely performance as Countess Sophie, Eisenheim's long-time love; and Rufus Sewell is approriately hateful as the evil Prince. The sepia-toned photography is perfect for the era depicted, as is the wonderful lighting. The musical score fit the story and era like a glove.Would someone please explain to me why this film didn't get the rave reviews it deserved!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	Bought these as a gift for my daughter. I was surprised at the high quality of the gloves because they were so reasonably priced, and they arrived in a reasonable length of time. I would purchase from this vendor again!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	1	The Manual that comes with this coffeemaker should be rewritten by someone who has actually used it! There are almost no instructions for how to program it, and some of the basics aren't mentioned at all. (Like using the permanent filter and using the paper filters that are included -- do you use one or both?? I found out the hard way.) There are too many other omissions to list here. The coffeemaker does make good coffee, but I still haven't figured out how to program it to turn itself off, or how to set the clock, which is so small I can barely see it. I really miss my old Mr. Coffee that died after 6 years.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I've been reading Tarot and teaching Tarot for 25 years and probably own a dozen different Tarot decks. The Morgan-Greer is my all-time favorite. No matter how many other decks I try to work with, this is the one I always return to. The colors are so vibrant and the artwork so beautiful, this deck truly speaks to me. The people illustrated on these cards are handsome, extremely appealing, and reflect each aspect of life clearly. If your intuitive or psychic abilities are stimulated by visuals, this is the perfect deck for you!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I just received this covered casserole dish and it's really good looking. It's nice to find an attractive casserole with a lid that's not just the standard Corning Ware White -- although I have those too. I bought it mainly as a serving dish for mashed potatoes because it has a lid and will keep the contents warm on the table, but it's a very nice depth for all kinds of food you want to keep hot. The color and traditional styling of this casserole are really pretty as well and I'm thinking about buying more of the pieces that are available in this style.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	0	I must say I've enjoyed the work of all 4 main actors (Winslet, Diaz, Law, and Black) in other films, but they are all sadly wasted in this one. And casting Jack Black opposite Kate Winslet? Totally unbelievable. The only semi-believable character is Rufus Sewell as Winslet's cad of an ex-boyfriend. The basic plot sounded like fun and had real potential, but much of the dialogue sounded like something a high school student might have written. And I'm not trying to insult high school students who aspire to be writers, but most of the dialogue is truly immature. The only reason I'm giving it even one star is because Jude Law is so good to look at.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	0	I enjoyed the previous John Keller-Hit Man books by Lawrence Block, who has been one of my favorite authors for many years. But this one fell kind of flat. In the earlier books, Keller has a certain charm, despite being a professional killer. For some reason, in this outing Keller comes across simply cold-blooded and inhuman. I think the author took away Keller's formerly interesting personality and all of his charm. This book is not really a novel, but rather a series of short stories about various hits Keller is hired for. Perhaps this is why Keller's character suffers this time out. I am hoping for a much better book with the latest Keller novel, HIT AND RUN.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	Just received this back scratcher and it's my new "best friend". It gives just enough of a scratch without drawing blood -- which some of the bamboo back scratchers are prone to do -- and it's really cute! The length is perfect; it can reach every part of the back without any strain. Highly recommended!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	These tumblers came with a feature I wasn't expecting: the lid has an opening for a straw, making them great for kids as well as taking along in the car. Very nice!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	Anyone involved in a Workers Comp claim, even if you already have an attorney, will benefit from reading this book. It's lengthy, but very worthwhile. This book will give you all the information you will need to make good decisions and to know what to expect during the whole process. You will find information that your attorney may not tell you! You need to know all of your options as well as your responsibilities.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I stopped reading Nora Roberts' books several years ago as they began to seem redundant. However, this Key trilogy was entertaining, and better than expected. I read all three, but this one was my favorite. Attractive characters, steamy love scenes -- what's not to like?
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I bought two of these Poker games -- one for my husband and one for me. The older Poker games we had just wore out. This one is really fun to play and a much better design than our old ones. It's lighted, which can be turned on and off, a nice battery saver, and it has an attached cover to keep the dust off. I've found that these Radica games are the best, and they're well priced as well. Our old ones lasted for about twenty years, so they're really durable. Highly recommended!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	When I found that my husband had taken my Aveeno Hand Cream to work -- and failed to return it -- I was really upset as I couldn't find it at my local drugstore, which is where I found it originally. But as always, Amazon came through and I have it again! It's not greasy, it soaks right into the skin, and actually does last through a few hand-washings. I only have to apply it once a day, and my hands feel as soft as a baby's you-know-what! This is the best hand cream I've ever found and I've tried dozens.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	Love this product! We're using it to refinish our kitchen cabinets, saving ourselves thousands of dollars. And the results are beautiful!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I've loved all Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels, but this one is a stand-out. Terrific characters, and I didn't figure it out until close to the end. This one is truly a classic.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	My husband used this marker to refresh our dark-stained kitchen cabinets, which were fairly beat up. What an incredible job he did! Our cabinets look almost new, and they're almost 50 years old! Can't recommend these markers highly enough.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	Robert Goldsborough has done an excellent job of continuing Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries. One would have to have read all the Rex Stout novels to be able to distinguish between the two writers. I have read everything Rex Stout ever wrote, so I did notice some very subtle differences in this work, but nothing that jumped out at me. Nero Wolfe is as irascible and brilliant as ever, and Archie Goodwin as intrepid and sarcastic as usual. I've now read all of Goldsborough's Nero Wolfe novels, and just wish there were more!
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	0	Although this book is called a "classic", and listed as appropriate for 5-year olds, I think it's better suited for 3 or 4-yr. olds. I won't even read it to my twin grandsons who are 5 because I think they'd be bored silly. It's very dated as far as children's books go.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	There is a lot of good information in this book for anyone writing in the paranormal genre. Actually, a lot more information than I needed! It's not easy to find this much folklore and legend in one book, so I'm glad I found it.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	I had been looking for a large tablecloth for special occasions as my old ones have definitely seen better days. I bought this one in a gold shade that's really beautiful -- even nicer in person than on line. It will look great set with my white china and can be used year-round, not just for Christmas and New Year's. It's cotton/poly which means it will come out of the dryer nicely. I'm really looking forward to using it.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	0	0	I would give this recording zero stars if I could. The audio quality is awful. These are not a re-mastering of the original recordings. I don't know where they got these versions, but they're really poor. Johnny Tillotson's music deserves far better than this. Don't waste your money.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	The pattern in these napkins, and of course the matching tablecloth, is really elegant. The color is a beautiful tawny gold that I think will look great under my white china. I haven't washed these yet, but I'm confident they will wash and dry well.
A1C0IVWUUIZDG3	1	1	This tablecloth is available in several colors and several sizes. I now own two sizes -- holiday table and everyday table -- and I ordered the gold color which is a beautiful, rather subtle gold -- nothing yellowy -- that looks great with my white china. The fabric is cotton and poly so it washes and dries beautifully. I bought the matching napkins too! Love it!
A1C0M7G77HHBAX	0	1	Very light-weight. Ripped in two places as I was trying to place it on a 9" tall box spring. Actually placing it into the bed-frame caused a couple more rips. Used packing tape to seal the tears and offer some protection from the new bed-bug menace that seems to be sweeping the country. I will not buy this again.
A1C0M7G77HHBAX	1	1	A formally-trained chef, I replaced a FULL set of Calphalon Commercial with these pans. The Calphalon was corroding from being washed in a dishwasher--who doesn't use a dishwasher these days? HELLO!?!?The Cuisinart MultiClad Pro (be sure of the name, Cuisinart has similarly-named products that are not of the same caliber) looks great, cooks great, and is a dream to clean and store. Have had no sticking problems with the skillets sticking (the trick is to use a little lower temperature and to put your oil into a hot pan just before you add the food).
A1C0M7G77HHBAX	1	1	Use these constantly in working on desktop printers. Impossible to find the little bits of paper and miscellany that gets find its way into the paper path and nooks and crannies without them. The pick-up tool has been a life-saver on many, many occasions. Not extra heavy-weight; just the usual "made in China" grade stuff, but invaluable.
A1C0M7G77HHBAX	1	1	Nice little product. Comparatively small, which is what I wanted. Toasts bread evenly on both sides. Very, very lightweight--so much so that you have to hold it down when pushing the eject or stop buttons.The cord comes out at a strange place and cannot be reconfigured. The designer, apparently, intended for the device to be placed with the long back edge along the wall--rather than perpendicular.
A1C0OLWUD7BDY4	0	0	My my book crashed within a few months. The customer service never picks up the phone. It just keeps ringing. The enclosure is sealed so I can't check open it unless I want to void the warranty, which I will do tommorrow.If you buy this product just keep your fingers crossed that you will never need customer support. Warranty is meaningless.
A1C0OLWUD7BDY4	1	1	I am unhappy about some people's reviews on this book - even the praise. They keep relating to Christofer as an autisitc patient. Autism is of various kinds. Please correct your perspective and be accurate. This book is quite accurate in protraying one kind and is not a bible on autism. Actually, I do not consider Asperger's = Autism. The two are way different - take a walk with me, inside my head!If you think everyone is speacial and different, and that cuts and bruises are different from each other, then please see autism and asperger's as differently. This book is about a boy with asperger's, not with autism. If you eat a lemon hoping to taste orange, you may be disappointed and may even complain that "the orange is not right"!Just like the skin gets cut and blood comes out - both - in a cut and a bruise, so is the brain disfunction in both autism and asperger's. I believe that the symptom for both are remarkably different, the family support needed is different and the treatment is also different.Just because they are (both) characterized under autism (umbrella), does not make this - a book about autism. It is a wonderfully close impression of what goes in my head when I am faced with similar incidents (not just the incident of the dog but many other minor incidents too). Kudos to the author to have seen so deep into a brain incapable of expressing what is different in his head as against other's heads.Inability to read emotions of other people and to share those feelings has a great analogy. We are to you what men are to women, when it comes to failure in a sexual courtship.Sorry for wasting your time...!
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	0	This book was born out the need for a handy, basic guide to many of the words and phrases used in Masonry. It was designed for the new Mason, but is handy to many more experienced masons than might admit to needing this book. Another useful book for the new Mason is :The Newly-Made Mason
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	A truly beautiful work to assist all Seekers of Light. Another great book would be:Brother Of The Third Degree
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	This is a work that is both educational and inspirational. It can provide guidance for all and should be read and reread.A great companion book is:Brother Of The Third Degree
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	A wonderful book for the new Mason or non-Mason who wants to learn something about Freemasonry. Another great one for the new or non-Mason is:Masonic Questions and Answers
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	This is a truly enlightening reprint of a Rosicrucian classic. Highly recommended. Also read:The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answers
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	This is a great book on New Orleans Creoles. A history on New Orleans as well as detailed info on who the Creoles are make this a valuable book for anyone with a love of or interest in New Orleans.
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	This great little book gives all of the known works of Albert Pike (published and unpublished). The compiler was the Librarian of the House of the Temple and gives us a very valuable research tool.Another great book on Albert Pike is:The Life Story Of Albert Pike
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	This is a great overview of Rosicrucian thought and practice. It's a wonderful introduction for any Seeker. Another good introduction is:The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answers
A1C0VU51HTNXF3	1	1	Ancient and Modern InitiationThe edition of "Ancient and Modern Initiation" by Max Heindel (ISBN: 1475290721 Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform May 1, 2012) was taken from the Cornerstone Book Publishers edition (ISBN: 188756070X Publisher: Cornerstone Book Publishers September 1, 2007). The book is a good one, so I assume that others wanted to take the work.
A1C0Y6OEAPI152	1	1	EXCELLENT reference book for every ECLECTUS parrot owner. easy to read and very helpful, especially for the first time parrot owner. the do and don'ts are all you need to know about diets, behavior patterns, temperament moods. safety, and general needs and suggestions....
A1C0Y6OEAPI152	0	1	not what i expected. the way it was described, i figured the playground was bigger that it actually is.due to that fact, not every item can be enjoyed and utilized by the parrot.. not really satisfied/////
A1C0Y6OEAPI152	1	1	....this item is one of my favorites... i use it year round. this is not the first time that i bought this item...i normally use it as a gift from time to time....buy it and you will love it......you will be buying another one before you know it!!!!!
A1C0YLSE6VLC12	1	1	If you haven't heard of Visine well it's probably the most popular eye drops out there, they're really good and I can't believe I'm doing this review. Just go ahead buy it.Can't go wrong with this.
A1C0YLSE6VLC12	0	0	I watched this movie on Blu-Ray and I have to say it's one of the grainiest Blu-Ray's I've ever watched. I had to double check to see if it was in fact a Blu-Ray disc and not a DVD. The grain may have been added on purpose but it didn't look intentional to me, anyone with a brain can tell you that this is way too grainy for it to even qualify for Blu-Ray.Don't get me wrong, the movie is great. I've seen it a million times and it's always entertaining but I'm just reviewing this movie from at Blu-Ray quality stand point.You're better off buying the DVD version, specially if it's going to save you money.
A1C0YLSE6VLC12	1	1	These are my favorite boxers from now on. They are very, very comfortable and do not give you wedgies.The price is great as well, but it seems that Amazon raised the price on them. Shame really because I got them under $14.
A1C0YLSE6VLC12	1	1	Forget those other headsets, specially the overpriced 'official' XBOX headsets. Buy this instead.I had mine for over a year and never gave me any problems, sound quality was excellent, the plastic does not feel cheap and overall it was a great product.It took tons of abuse from being dropped to the cables being trampled on with the computer chair wheels to stepping on it. Finally one day, I had one too many beers and in my drunkeness I decided to use the 'throne' as I got up I felt a bit tipsy and started stumbling my way to the 'office' and then CRACK! Oh noes! I stepped on my precious headset, I picked it up and the ear cup part broke away from the ring that goes over your head. :(So yeah this thing took a whole lot of abuse from my part until; because of my own stupid self the thing broke in two. Oh and it was still working! Seriously! I could still chat and hear people on the headset, only exception being that I couldn't wear it over my head.This is definitely a lot better than those other headsets which cost nearly as much (if not more) and you have to keep buying them. Seriously I have gone through a ton of thoseXbox 360 Headsetand this thing lasted way more than all of them combined, the thing paid for itself!STOP LOOKING FOR ANOTHER HEADSET AND BUY THIS! NAO!

A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	1	0	An excellent, odorless pen.The fine-point cap is very small, slick and tight - easy to mark up your hands removing or replacing the cap.--- edit ---The fine point started out very fine, ideal even. It has quicklydulled now but still is useable.
A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	0	1	I purchased 6 of these in 2007; all were ~DOA.All ports recognized USB devices, but each card had exactly one port that would read an entire thumb drive without it disappearing. I tried several brands of flash drives; none would work on other ports for long.
A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	1	1	This game is different from Civ2 in many ways, butthe important things are the same.I would give 5 stars if the corruption & waste were not so crippling - I won't play a stock game again, waiting dozens of turns for a small wonder to get built with 90% waste - I did a mod to cut the waste. Now it plays like a dream.It is very easy to do mods that make the game new again - look on the web for ideas, then play with the editor - years of fun!Add resources for a very challenging mod with good realism.The one serious problem is adding techs - making a pretty tech tree is really rough.
A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	0	1	Mouse pad is very nice, looks new after 1 year,but the pad is much too hard - and too narrow.It is indented in the middle, across the pad.I don't know if it is better than a plain pad.
A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	0	0	Thin, very soft layer over narrow hard wrist pad -Felt ok at first, but after a few long days wrist pain got much worse.The top layer is too soft and the whole rest is too smallfor a tall man with heavy arms.
A1C1DXPNU3PLFE	1	1	I have used several of these for a second line of defensebehind cable modems and DSL modems for years.They are very handy to have around and very easy to use.I use them even for non-net surge protection when I need only 1 or 2 plugs.I think these have not had any serious surges hit the net portsbecause the modems still work, but several no longer passfast ethernet signals after less than 4 years.The line surge lights are still on, so I have retired these tonon-net use. The price is very good, and I have places to use themoff-net, so I am satisfied, but I would like to see them improved before I get more.
A1C1GIKHU7KE4L	0	0	I very seldom rate books, not because they're not good or they are good, just because I read so many. But this one deserved something... what, I'm not sure.I live in the south, and I'm proud of it. I love the way we talk and think, and sound. However, Irene Hunt -- an author who usually I like -- really took the phonetic spelling TOO far. Even I had problems understanding it at times, and that's the way people around here talk!Aside from that, I did find the book dull, and hard to get into.In short, Hunt has written some very good books (The Lottery Rose was brilliant) but this isn't one of them.
A1C1GIKHU7KE4L	1	0	I've read all of the books Johansen has written in the Eve Duncan series, because I love the characters and their stories. So I was excited to see the web of 'certralness' branch out to Jane.I like that Jane is tough, and I like that I can relate with the character, for once, an author not being afraid to write a teenager who isn't an ignorant airhead, caring only about clothing and hair.But as much as I love her characters, the more I've read Johansen, I think her writing is only so-so. There are only so many time you can say 'tentatively' and 'warily." Way too many adjectives and adverbs...Stephen King warns against those, and while I don't like his stories, I respect his writing.So all in all, I'll still be buying her hardcovers...I'm a collecter like that, don't like paperbacks, only hardcovers...but I hope she learns to limit the use of her favourite words.
A1C1IWZDGO5QIL	1	1	For those of you who like the New York power-house financial world this book is for you. Plenty of twists, turns and excitement around every page. It kept me up past the bed hour a few times.
A1C1IWZDGO5QIL	0	0	I read the book in two days because I've read most of Frey's books but I don't like the politics story. Too far fetched. I thought the series was getting a little off track in the last book. Frey needs to stick to finance power books. I also hated to see Gillette become such a dumbass, wimp. Get back to the days of Protege!!
A1C1IWZDGO5QIL	1	1	The writers style is very interesting indeed. Very vivid and descriptive almost to the point of overdoing it. I really liked this book though and understand why there is some kind of "cult" following of it. The characters come to life in this book and the theory behind the plot is very interesting. I understand why 50 years after the book was written it is still popular. Especially in today's expanding government. I would highly recommend that you read it for your self. Also, like I always add to my posts: get this book at the library and save your money for your future.
A1C1IWZDGO5QIL	1	1	If you like Stephen Frey then you will enjoy this book. I've read most of his books and this would rank toward the top. Sure the other reviews complain about depth of characters and a somewhat unbelievable plot but that is Frey. Lots of action, lots of twists and lots of fun. That is what Frey is about. As I always end: Remember, get this book from your library and save your cash.
A1C1MTNBCTSWID	1	1	I've begun a small E.T. collection all over again. The film was released in 1982, when I was a year old. I remember seeing this one as a child years before I saw any Star Wars films (of which I'm also a fan), and my room was FILLED with E.T. curtains, toys, posters... This figure doesn't say anything very new, if you're like me and bought all three E.T. figures, but it's still adorable if you remember the scene where Gerdie dresses him up like one of her dolls. &quot;I'll be right here...&quot;
A1C1MTNBCTSWID	1	1	Actually, I haven't heard Volume 4 yet. I saw the Joe Jackson Band play a possibly life-changing show at House of Blues the other night, and new songs like &quot;Love at First Light&quot; and &quot;Thugz-R-Us&quot; were some of the best I heard that night. I highly anticipate getting this CD and more of Jackson's material. My mom and uncle turned me onto Joe as a child (&quot;Steppin' Out&quot; and Look Sharp!), and his music is still vital to me. Go, Joe...you're still the man!
A1C1MTNBCTSWID	1	1	Getting a book like this, I'm used to getting a primer in guitar theory. Not only do we get that (separated into three levels: Rhythm, Melodic, and Harmonic) in lessons that don't discriminate by genre, but also a full guitar maintenance guide, and helpful information concerning recording and performing live. Most of the book is very rock-centric, and I would have liked a little more attention focused on classical style just for variation. But I'm a rock fan anyway, so it worked perfectly.The main reason I bought it is because the advanced guitar classes at Loyola New Orleans (my alma mater) used it as a textbook. I can see why!
A1C1MTNBCTSWID	1	1	This is an excellent DVD. And I bought it only for the classic "Mickey's Christmas Carol," which is presented here in a pretty good transfer. (Though I've heard that the version released in the silver-tin Mickey Mouse boxed set is superior.) A great DVD for the price!
A1C1MTNBCTSWID	1	1	I bought two copies of this, one for our New Orleans Saints collection and one for a co-worker who's been a season ticket holder since 1979, when they were still the "Aints." Green Day has always been one of my favorite bands, and this collaboration with U2 is an energetic, uplifting homage to a team and a city that has come up from absolute disaster and triumphed. The CDs came to me very quickly and were in great condition!
A1C1SKWYHRYA8Z	0	0	I will not deny that Vladimir Nabokov is a brilliant writer. Although I found his word play unimpressive, I could never imagine being so competent at a second language (even one I had been taught from childhood) that I could give such vivid and impassioned descriptions in it. However, Lolita was not something I wanted to read. Although I enjoyed a few anecdotes about minor characters, I found most of the book either dull, revolting, or some combination of the two. It is perhaps not the pedophilia that disgusts me so much as Humbert Humbert's complete possession and manipulation of his object and his willingness to continue to use her even when she is so unhappy that only the hope of some roadside attraction sustains her through the day. I can accept that a pedophile can really love his victim or nymphet, but I cannot believe that he would, if this love exists, allow her to live a miserable and hopeless existence that he creates with deception (for example, the reasons he gives to Lolita not to reveal the situation to anyone). Furthermore, as I said earlier, Lolita is simply dull. Humbert Humbert has no real personality, outside of being a pedophile, and Lolita never really appears as anything but an object. Their journeys, the Americana-lover's road trips across the country, take pages and pages to describe, without any intermittent interesting dialogue or significant plot development. Nabokov's command of the English language is masterful, but that was the only reason I could find to read Lolita.
A1C1SKWYHRYA8Z	1	1	When Pan's Labyrinth first came out, my parents asked if I wanted to see it. Not having heard of it yet, I asked what it was about. They told me it was about the Spanish Civil War. As it turns out, saying that Pan's Labyrinth is about the Spanish War is like saying Casablanca is about the beginning of World War II. Although technically true, these summaries ignore the very essence of the movie. After they saw Pan's Labyrinth, they told me I really should have come and that it had a lot of fantasy elements, too. If only I had known that before...Anyway, I did eventually see the movie, and it was fantastic. The main character gives one of the best performances ever by a child actress, and the plot is fascinating and enthralling. The ending is ambiguous, leading to disagreement, but in a good way. The mix between the fantasy and the real brutality was well done, too. I adored this movie.
A1C1WG2O4R7N11	1	1	Jeff Dunham is great with all of his dummies. I am usually laughing so hard that I am teary eyed.
A1C1WG2O4R7N11	1	1	Of the four of the comedians that are in the tour that Bill Engvall was with, he is for sure my favorite one. Here's your sign is great.
A1C1WG2O4R7N11	1	1	Very good book. I am looking forward to getting the rest of the series. Very interesting from a different point of view, that of the cat.
A1C222BOIXPIO9	1	1	I bought this for my unfinished basement, as I was concerned about the closed ventilation there. The second night I had this up and running it went off with a loud tone.With that I opened all the windows and the basement door, and after awhile it stopped beeping. The next day I had the AC guy come in, and apparently there was something wrong with our pipe connections.Without my detector we could have run into a real bad scenario.I am glad I purchased it, and feel like everyone should have them in their household. These detectors save lives.
A1C222BOIXPIO9	1	1	I was real hesitant to buy this battery. But for the price, and convenience of free shipping, I cant say that I regret it.The battery looks good, there is no wires or anything out of place, and for the price how could you go wrong? I had to replace an old V3 battery that I used for overseas trips and never had an issue. Battery lasted longer than my original when I first bought it. Plus if you are getting better battery life and way cheaper battery why would you complain. Anyways, hope this review helps anyone setting on the fence like myself.
A1C222BOIXPIO9	1	1	I have been looking for some decent sheets at a good price point for awhile. I can truthfully say that I have found these sheets to be the most comfortable and soft from all the other sheets I have used over the years. I didn't notice any issues with the stitching and the sheets fitted well. The sheets are slightly thicker than my previous sheets, and I havent had any issues with sweating during sleep. The pockets were deep enough for our bed, which did help the sheets from not forming lumps during the night. I would definitely buy another set for future use. if your on the fence about wether to get these or not, I would say that you should try them out.
A1C2BE57W5MBR1	1	1	Now, i've been reading the reviews by a lot of the folks on here. It seems that some people will just never be fully satisfied with any type of audio device. You hear things like "I broke out my audio inducing wave enhancement reader and took a treble reading and learned that these are .009 freqency modulations below my model 123-XYZ headphones." And how is a review like this going to help me when i want to buy some great sounding headphones for my own personal use? Some people thrive on finding the teeniest most insignificant issue with something as simple as a great sounding pair of headphones... they'll never be satisifed with anything on the market no matter what. Ahhh... to be so self rightous and yet not be employed by anyone who actually creates quality products like these headphones.Now, i'm an average guy who recognizes a great pair of headphones when i hold them in my hands and listen to them. These headphones are fantastic in all the ways you'd like headphones to be. For starters, they're quite lightweight and fit very comfortably. The earpieces are soft and flexible to your ear which will give you plenty of comfort on those long flights or roadtrips.The sound is great! Deep bass and sharp clear treble with the mids right where you'd like them. Of course this is all based on how you like to set your EQ when you listen, but that's all up to the individual. No matter how you like to listen to your music, i don't think you could ever go wrong with these. I have had my pair for 3 years now and they still sound as great as the day i bought them! I had considered buying a pair of Bose TriPort headphones or these and after comparing price and sound, in my opinion these sounded just as good and were priced less so it was really a no brainer. I use these with my Creative Zen Vision M mp3 player and my portable dvd player on long flights and I'm just amazed with them!If you're going to buy headphones just to take frequency measurements and sample bit rates... you'll never find a pair of headphones that truly meet your "standards". For those of us not living in la-la land, give these a shot, you'll really be glad you did!
A1C2BE57W5MBR1	1	1	After reading these other reviews, i'm really surprised at the negative feedback its getting! I wonder if we're all playing the same game??? I'm a big football fan and couldn't wait for this to hit the shelves to i could take my team to the championship and it's been nothing but a good time playing this game!The graphics and sound are truly top notch for the psp platform. Smooth screen movement, great player animations, and finding your open reciever is challanging. EA went all out on their research and depending on where you're playing, the crowd noise can be a real factor! As you play the game your team can build or loose momentum with actually affects the way your team plays. If you can break out some early scores, it can make for a tough time on the other team to climb back into the game. The play selection is wide open with some deep playbooks and making some of them work is a great challange. The big hits are great with the analog stick and the sound is fantastic. The stadiums look great and have all of the whistles and bells that make college football so great, right down to the mascots.The off the field play is just as much fun. If you play a dynasty then you're in control of a team for 10 seasons. The entire recruting process is a great feature! Depending on how your team finishes, you can make yourself more attractive to the new recruits. You set your budget and based on your budget you're given so many points to disperse amongst how you recruit players. You can choose to recruit locally which costs less points or go to the other side of the country which costs more. Recurits are based on caliber and interest so it's easier to go after the players you need to fill the holes. You can even scout individual recruits for a few points and see how well they're disciplined and what kind of potential they have. You can also try to convince uninterested players in commiting to you which is tricky. Winning the big games gets other recruits interested in your program. You can even pick up to 3 players to recruit during the season and invite them for visits and to watch a game. The game throws a curve at you with players commiting offenses or breaking team rules and you have to decide what action to take. The recruting feature is wide open and makes the game great!If you're looking for the big challange, you can import a dvision 1-AA team into a conference and try to build them up in 10 seasons. It's tough, trust me! Think you can get Yale to the national championship???In regards to the slow motion comments, the game features a "matrix" style of gameplay during the big plays. The game will go into slow mo here and there and zoom in on the players. It speeds back up quickly and allows you to break out the big play or miss it. It makes for another great challange. I haven't found this to hinder the game at all. The game even has an awards ceremony with the heisman at the forefront. You can check stats for just about anything during each season. Sometimes, a player might decide to leave before graduation and you have to try to convice him to stay one more season. You just never know how each year will affect next season.all in all, i'd say EA has a real winner on their hands! Don't believe the negative reviews. If you love college football, you'll really love this game!
A1C2BE57W5MBR1	1	1	I previously owned madden 06 for psp and while i found it to be pretty fun, the infamous loading time really brought the fun factor to its knees. EA fixed this problem and a few more with 07 and overall this game is GREAT. Great graphics, great sound, challenging situations, and more to love.Being a Steelers fan, i first played against the titans to get a feel for the game play and it wasn't hard to pick up since the controlls are essentially the same as 06. EA opened things up with the analog stick which gives you more types of juking moves on offense and harder hits with the defense. the screen movement is smooth and fluent which makes finding an open reciever easier then 06. The game also moves faster then 06 so you have to be on your toes. The sound is also a big improvement when you've got on a good pair of headphones as the crowds are louder and the hits realy stand out. They've even added some new commentary from John and Al along with the some of the same stuff from 06.The franchise mode is great. The game sets goals for you to reach each week and if you acomplish those goals then you're rewarded with points you can distribute amongst your players each week, constantly improving your team as you move through the season. Thanks to this feature, your rookies can develop faster as the season moves along. The graphics are a big improvement also with more shading and the players move better, even their hair seems to shake when they put the big hit on you. There's also some pretty cool end zone celebrations.I can't seem to put this game down and am looking forward to the long road trip i have coming up thanks to this game. This game puts 06 to shame which wouldn't be too tough since EA was making their first football game on the psp platform with 06 so you can tell that they studied what needed to be better and did it. Good job EA, great game! You won't be dissapointed!
A1C2BE57W5MBR1	0	0	Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review. Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend.The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is very misleading. One would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive. I'm a big fan of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off. I couldn't be more wrong. Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start. The entire movie is over the top starting with the actors. Everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie. She looks lost, confused, and out of her league. Other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, a "wacky" police sgt with his asthmatic partner, the bait & tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest.The movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere. When meteors strike the earth (and slam into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies. Our main characters all meet up and try to survive. However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle. The viewer is left to wonder what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by. I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more. Bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst camera work i've ever seen. This movie apparently took two years to make... imagine if they only had one???Another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait & tackle charater. He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his eyes to boot). Then, he walks away. When he appears again, he's able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his "spurs" into the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands. Does this guy ever miss? What do you think? He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down. Not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia!If you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the top. I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half. Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head. I personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter. Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don't get it.The absolutely worst part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music. It never stops! There's never a scene without music for some reason! And it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy! It reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing. The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with extra cheese included. Did they use up their budget on the effects? Probably! I found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film!If you're a fan of good monster / zombie movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving. It doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is... well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours back. I know i do!!!
A1C2HEO6L4KQ1	0	0	I have never had a greater desire to spew profanity than when I opened PowerPoint 2007 and stared at a screen where it was absolutley impossible to find the F****** SAVE BUTTON.This is dog crap. The changes are useless, stylistic, fluff that do nothing except screw up your productivity because you can't figure out how to do what you've been doing for years.
A1C2HEO6L4KQ1	1	1	PERFECTLY smooth, straight, silky hair in minutes. It's real. There is no comparison between the Chi and cheap irons. It's something about the ceramic heating system. It's very different than metal.
A1C2HEO6L4KQ1	1	1	This is the best self-tanner I've ever tried. I have fair skin that tans only after it burns, and this product is by far the most natural looking I have ever used. The result is tan, not orange-ish, and I love the subtle shimmer. A few people have commented on not liking the scent, but I really love the mango scent.
A1C2LCP0XQ9TU7	1	0	This is a very general overview of communications theory that is not specific to either electronics nor to human communications, but more to describing information transfer concepts and metrics. To get the most of this book, you should have a fair memory of the concepts of differential and integral calculus but not more (e.g. differential equations).
A1C2LCP0XQ9TU7	1	1	I found this book to be well written and very interesting because it presents information coupled with immediate problems and suggested solutions (to selected problems) that prove to be quite stimulating.
A1C2MB96GM2EGU	1	1	My husband and I are using the video and having a lot of fun! I would recommend it to anyone!
A1C2MB96GM2EGU	1	1	My husband has helped a lot in the kitchen while I've been pursuing a higher degree. He doesn't like to peel a potato with a paring knife like I usually did. When I showed him this peeler, he was so happy! It works very easily and now we both use it for peeling all sorts of things including cucumbers and carrots.
A1C2MB96GM2EGU	1	1	I have only used the pans once and they were easy to hold while getting them in and out of the oven. Easy clean up!
A1C2MB96GM2EGU	1	1	These remind me of that candy that sort of bursts in your mouth! They are a little tart but still tasty. My husband even likes taking them.
A1C2PMDK38BL3E	1	1	This is probably one of the best (if not THE best) book on philosophy I've ever read. It contains valuable teachings on how a samurai warrior should be.Discipline,honor,integrity are just a few of the things Sensei Musashi has to teach through this book. Its philosophies can be applied to everybody despite their profession and/or lifestyle.
A1C315F2T7EQPP	1	1	If You are a Herschall Gordon Lewis Fan or just love vintage Gore, then Buy this DVD now! Firstly the print quality is beautiful very clean and crisp. There is an awesome Secondary audio track With the man himself Herschell and Producer David Friedman, who rant quite lucidly about being exploitation filmmakers, and the golden age of Gore. This happens to be one of the first Gore movies ever made, very disturbing at the time (even today) The wonderful extras on the DVD keep you occupied for hours, it has over 50 MINITES OF OUTAKES! extremely rare stuff no one has seen for years, also included on the DVD is an extra short film with one of the actors from Color me Blood red, called &quot;Cutting Magic&quot;. Image makes some of the greatest Dvds for affordable prices. This movie you'll never find on a Criterion lable.

A1C315F2T7EQPP	0	0	Ive bought this dvd three times and all three time I had to return it, it seems that there was an error in the manufacturing process rendering some of the disc one discs. It appears that everyone of the time I bought this two disc set, both discs are the same (supplement discs), even though both are correctly labeled disc one and two. So buyers beware, im kinda of leary in trying to buy another in the hopes of getting a proper set. Obviously there are proper sets floating around or else there would'nt be so many positive reviews.
A1C315F2T7EQPP	0	1	Was going to order this set but saw all the reviews that this set is butchered, I own the dvd set and would like the bluray to be the same aspect ratio. So this wont be a purchase for me, I really can't believe that they would re-format it to 16x9, really ignorent people working at that company.

A1C3798H56VC3T	1	1	Enough has been written about these phones. For the most part these are a nice set of phones. I am just going to give the negatives.1. No volume control. 99 percent of the time the volume is fine. But...2. No lit keypad. What? Not a big deal to me, but come on.....3. They managed to goof up the caller ID menu on this phone. Some of it is better than the earlier phones like these, some of it is stupid. The caller ID does display when the calls come in, but if you want to go into the caller ID and see who might have called earlier, well grrrrrThere is one positive that is nice, these phones use just regular rechargeable AAA NIMH batteries, no more hunting for special batteries for your phones.
A1C3798H56VC3T	0	1	According to Monroe's website I needed this tool on my 97 Passat to remove the rear struts. I have no idea why they said that. I just used an impact gun and the nut came right off. It was not expensive, like 7 bucks. But still.....
A1C3798H56VC3T	1	1	I have used Sensa trac struts before. I have had good luck with them in the past. They seem to give good service and a factory type ride. My car is a VW Passat. While the struts themselves are a good product I would recommend that you replace the strut mounts and strut bearings with factory or OEM parts. Unfortunately I have seen some the Monroe replacement bearings before and they are not very well made, and they are different from the factory type and you will not be happy with the ride if you use them. However I don't think you can beat the struts for the price.
A1C3798H56VC3T	1	1	I have several older Maglite flashlights that I used the Maglite conversion LED bulbs on. I can't find those bulbs anymore and I had a problem with them. If you are rough with them (I am a mechanic and from time to time I manage to drop them) you will find that the lens will pop off the bulb housing. Once that happens the bulb quits working of course and it is useless. If you can find the Maglite brand bulbs for sale they cost as much as the whole LED flashlight that you can buy on Amazon. I bought the 2D cell to see how it would hold up compared to the LED conversion bulbs. So far so good. Of course everyone wants to know about the light it makes. It is very white, and it seems be a bit brighter than the 3 watt LED conversion bulbs when you look at them side by side. Of course battery levels and age might have something to do with that. I would recommend that you don't buy the AA or AAA cell Maglite they are junk. I still buy the AA conventional Maglites and put Niteize three LED bulbs in them,. Yes, they are much more purple but they are tough bulbs and have never let me down. The niteize 1 watt AA bulbs have the problem where the lens pops off too. So, if you are rough with the flashlights there are some tip for you. I would recommend the 2D cell LED flashlight to anyone.
A1C3AGJUHG1VGP	1	1	Purchased these plates to compliment dinner sized plates and mugs. They look great on the table and the art work makes everyone hungry. Serve up some sliced apples, peaches, cherries, pears, or plums..... or you will still wonder what was missing from the menu after admiring these.
A1C3AGJUHG1VGP	1	1	Purchased as a holiday gift for a 9 year old boy. Again, looking for a change from video games and something we can do together. New shape adds interest.
A1C3AGJUHG1VGP	1	1	These socks are good in the fall and winter. In the summer you will need to switch. Still soft and comfy plus good quality.
A1C3CDF6WPJKXR	0	0	This has to be one of the most unbelieveable and ignorant stories that i have ever read. All that Reynolds does is pile on more and more punishment schemes and eccentric behavior from Grandfather Herman. She does little to offer up either a reality or any kind of explanation as to why the characters act as they do. It could have been an interesting story to tell if there was some sort of realism or insight into these characters. Reynold comes off as completely ignorant as she creates this far-fetched community of religious zealouts, it would have served her message and novel better if she would have made it a bit more realistic.
A1C3CDF6WPJKXR	1	1	Can't wait for the DVD release of Homefront. This release is long overdue.
A1C3G2OXGQ7EB4	1	1	This is a fun train piece...just be sure to glue the straight piece on the top part of the mountain, otherwise it slides all around the plastic and my toddler found this frustrating. You can remove the top part of the mountain and use it to make another tunnel, all kinds of creative things can be done with this set.
A1C3G2OXGQ7EB4	1	1	This is the best car seat bag I have owned so far...and I have purchased them all as I constantly travel overseas through the year with my kids and their car seats. So I really put my car seat bags to the test and constantly have to replace them.I usually purchase the car seat bags with wheels, but decided on this one as it was padded and thought it might last longer. The other car seat bags I have purchased would not even make it one international trip with connecting flights and normally end up ripping.I fit my son's Britax Frontier Booster car seat (it's huge and very heavy) perfectly in this bag and even had room for coats and things. At the airport I carried the car seat on my back (backpack style), while carrying my infant on my front (in a carrier) and pushing my toddler in a stroller....and I am not a large woman and I did just fine.After checking the car seat bag and having it gone through many different hands and connecting flights...20 hours later. I was very impressed when I picked it up off the luggage belt. It looked exactly liked it did when I first checked it in...perfect.My previous experiences of car seat bags after travel have not been good. Normally the bags are scuffed or torn or the wheels have been torn off. While I was worried the straps from the backpack part might be torn or get snagged, they were in perfect condition after traveling.I highly recommend this car seat bag to anyone who travels with their child's car seat on a regular basis. You will get your money's worth out of it.
A1C3G2OXGQ7EB4	1	1	I think other reviews have already covered all the good points. Just wanted to add 5 stars to the count as this was my first time to read a Mo Hayder book and it was good. Really good. Could not put it down good!
A1C3G2OXGQ7EB4	0	0	unless you enjoy reading lots of cussing and want to become a vegan. I cuss and this book offended me. I also do not plan on becoming vegan.
A1C3HJ00AVPQ87	0	1	This Stones album has been reviewed into the ground, both those that love it and those that don't. I'm not going to attempt to persuade either side but only to make this point: if no one had ever heard of the Rolling Stones and this album by an unknown band came on the market would it be declared the masterpiece that it widely is? I doubt it. The Stones were already considered the greatest rock band ever at this point - a declaration I'm happy to say I don't agree with - and thus Exile arrived with Stones fans already highly anticipating it. It's not so much that the album continues no signature hits, it's the fact that, well, the quality of the writing just isn't up to that set by earlier records. Taken completely on its own, Exile is an interesting exercise in its moods and textures but hardly an album to run out and buy. The album is only one of the most overrated of this period BECAUSE it was hyped as not only one of the Stones best but one of the best albums of the era.
A1C3HJ00AVPQ87	1	1	Following the massive commercial success of Captain Fantastic, Rock of the Westies has often been overlooked in Elton John's career. And that's too bad because Elton and his crack band were never better on this mix of hard rockers and thoughtful ballads. Island Girl was the hit and it's certainly an enjoyable rocker with very funny lyrics. But it was Grow Some Funk of Your Own that shows just how hard this band could rock. Blasting out of the speakers with Johnstone's fuzz guitar, followed by Elton's piledriving piano, John jumps in with his gutsiest, most passionate vocals. The vocals match the surreal lyrics, with John adding in tongue-in-cheek comments such as "Oh, he was so macho" and "I knew the situation was ridiculous." John was never as unrestrained in his vocals as he was here. The guitars and drums built up the tension and then out of the blue the vibraphone kicks in, propelling the listener into a giddy euphoria, finally bringing the song to a close. John wrote more famous rockers but he never rocked harder than on this cut. John and Taupin do a 180 on the next song, the moody ballad I Feel Like a Bullet (in the Gun of Robert Ford). Atmospheric and engrossing, it contains one of Taupin's greatest lyrics "You know, I can't think straight no more." The other hard rock gem on Westies is the bitter Hard Luck Story. It matches the passionate vocals from Funk, adding blistering piano runs and Johnstone's propulsive guitar work. Rock of the Westies was on a par with John's best. If as some say, this was his last great album then he went out with a bang.
A1C3HJ00AVPQ87	1	1	Although the American Woman lp brought The Guess Who to U.S. fame and their follow up Share The Land, also excellent, sold millions of copies, I'm not alone in feeling that the band was at their creative peak on Canned Wheat. It is simply brimming with great songs and Cummings and Bachman were not only at the peak of their powers but on the same page creatively and spiritually. With The Guess Who you have to start with Cummings' voice, one of the purest and richest in all of rock music. He could rock out with the best of them but his natural melodicism allowed him to bring a sweetness to the softer numbers. The well known songs here -- Laughing, Undun and No Time -- are all classics and Burton's vocal on Undun is simply amazing. There's the jazzy 6 am or Nearer, the aching Minstrel Boy and the long interesting jam of Key but the underrated gem on this lp is Of a Dropping Pin. Jazzy and propulsive, it rocks out with flair, economy and a joyous spirit. On this lp, we catch the band not quite knowing how good they are so unencumbered by those expectations. They sound free and loose, a band at its peak without quite realizing it. Nothing else in rock sounded quite like it back then and nothing ever did.
A1C3HJ00AVPQ87	1	1	Though Delaney & Bonnie were best known for their association with Eric Clapton, and less so with George Harrison, they were true originals, combining southern soul, R&B, gospel and country into a potent brew. The albums that preceded this 1970 classic -- On Tour with Eric Clapton and Home -- established the soulful duo as bonafide stars and there's little use trying to compare the studio albums with the Clapton tour live set. What makes this album a standout is the great backing band (Kenny Gradney and Jim Gordon to name two) and the amazing voice of Bonnie Bramlett. It had always been there but she seemed to reach a peak here and Delaney more than holds his own. Bonnie's vocal on Love of My Man is sensational, soaked through and through with soul, and the other cuts simply burn. But the standout track for me is Soul Shake, which somehow impossibly manages to be a soul raver and a three minute slice of irresistible and infectious pop music, brought home by a blast of horns. The song is soaked with pure joy and that's no small feat. These three albums taken together represent a piece of musical history we'll likely never see again. And if D&B could shake Clapton out of his slumber and inspire him here and later with the Dominoes, then that itself is a testament to simply how great Delaney & Bonnie truly were.

A1C449MMN5DF75	1	1	I picked this book up from the library and was completely stunned. I had never even heard of this author but now I have to own everything she has written. This was an awesome historical paranormal romance. Rue ran away from her tribe of shape-shifting dragons to live in the city. Her childhood crush finds her and is determined to have her. Hardly any of the women in the tribe can shape-shift. As the alpha of the family she is already his. This is one of the best books about dragons I have ever read!! The sexual tension in this book is is amazing. I read this in about two hours.
A1C449MMN5DF75	1	1	I though I'd read all of Anne Stuart- but I was wrong and these books are really good. I love her dark heroes.
A1C449MMN5DF75	1	1	I bought this for my son and ended up reading it. It was a neat spin on a classic tale. My son read this really fast and really liked it. I think it would be good for anyone 4th grade on up.
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	0	0	Let's see, the writing is slow and tedious, there is very little suspense, the "main character" is not even introduced until the book is almost half over. The revelations are interesting but do not really titillate the imagination, and parts are rather predictable. In the end, everything is wrapped up a bit too tightly and easily. One comes from this book with a sense of hollowness.
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	0	1	Uhhh... okaay... I am going to point out something rather obvious here. Some of you may be shocked, and to tell the truth I am quite surprised myself that this has not come up before. After all, this is a book that has been read by millions of people, has been presumably edited, and has been presumably written by someone with a strong grasp of the English language. How this mistake could have come about and survived for so long is a mystery. A very strange mystery indeed. If anyone ever writes about this in the future I want this review here at Amazon to be credited. I am the first person to bring this up. Therefore, I want credit. I am not going to give out my personal information here, however, I have not found mention of what I am going to mention anywhere else on the Internet.The fact is, that the word "Cemetery" in the second part of the title is spelled incorrectly. As I suggest above, it is actually spelled as "cemetery" and not "sematary". Phoenetically, the two are the same, so one could see how a mistake could have been made. However, I have looked it up and both Merriam Webster's and American Heritage dictionaries back me up on this one, with the definition being "A place for burying the dead; a graveyard"; there is no entry for sematary. I have not checked Oxford English but, from a Google search, it is fairly clear that the word as it is used in the book refers to this one. Now, there might be another word in a different language or old English slang that is "sematary" and has a similiar meaning, however, I have not been able to find it. And if that were the explanation, wouldn't it seem strange that so many people don't know it? I mean, it might easily confuse people who thought that "sematary" was actually the misspelling of "cemetery."To be frank, I wish this book were never published. As a Ph.D. in Linguistics, I can definitely assert that the misspelling of words is one of the biggest problems that we have in society today. I read somewhere that around 10% of Americans are functionally illiterate. Contributing to this problem through such lax spelling standards is actually doing a great harm to society. In fact, I would not be surprised if, after reading which I am now writing, the Justice Department decided to open a lawsuit against Mr. King's publisher. I am writing to Attorney General Gonsalez about this, but please, don't let me be the only one. Write him a letter or send him an email. Look, I'll just give you a template."Dear Attorney General Gonsalez,As a concerned citizen I have deduced a major error in the printing of a popular novel, "Pet Cemetery," by Stephen King, wherein the numerous publisher(s) including major houses such as Sagebrush and Doubleday are negligently exposing Americans to incorrect spelling. It is important for the sake of public education, especially books that could be read by children and adolescents, that high standards of spelling be maintained.Sincerely,__________"Copy and paste this and send it to the Justice Department. E-mails to the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General, may be sent to AskDOJ@usdoj.gov. All it takes is a second to open your e-mail, but you can be a part of this people power movement to make America a better place!! DO IT NOW!Ultimately, it shocks me that such an error could even have gone uncaught for so long. I guess it's like the story of the Emperor's new clothes. This book has been around so long that people probably assume that there can't be any errrors, especially one so obvious. This causes even those who would ordinarily know the spelling to second-guess themselves. But, hey, not all of us have a superior intellect. And everyone should have their 15 minute of fame. I guess discovering this error in this book will be mine. Am I correct, or just an idiot? But I am a person of an open mind, I dont judge a book by just one spelling error. You know what they say "dont judge a book by its cover." Ive read the book of course and it is quite suspenseful. So I will give it two stars. But please, in the future when you are reading a book, don't just accept the editor's work! There could still be mistakes!
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	0	1	What is this supposed to be? The reviewer above says that it's "shocking and disturbing" and that it is especially good because of "the way it is structured," meaning that the investigators are on the path of missing young people and make the discovery of the video.I suppose the only thing good about this movie is that it is a brilliant refutation of "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime." Immanuel Kant should certainly have seen-- wait, what does this have to do with anything? The real question lies not with the ends but the means of achieving them, you see. So-- well-- in any case, I have not read much of Kant, nor do I understand him. In conclusion the bottom line is very simple. Having matured psychologically past the age of 13, I cannot bring myself to like this movie.So there.
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	1	1	The main character, Sophie Kinse-- I mean Becky Bloomwood, is so blooming ridiculous, you will likely find it humorous unless you are too extremely put off by the immature and naive behavior. Kinsella puts together a verbal slapstick comedy, where the punchline is not physical violence but feminine vapidity.The point is not to have sophisticated supporting characters or profound prose-- or a realistic plot, but just an escape and a jolly good time with a character that young women can apparently both identify with and look down on at the same time.
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	1	1	It has been 36 years since Fear of Flying was first published, and in the years since, Germany has changed, the place of women have changed, sexual mores have changed, and Jewish America has undoubtedly changed as well. Is this book still relevant? Do the questions that protagonist Isadora Wing-- part fictional, part based on author Erica Jong's own life, still speak to us? It's hard to say.But the jokes (for the most part) are still funny, I found myself smiling at this or that absurdity despite myself, despite sharing virtually nothing in common with Isadora. I could sense that the references were timeless, even though I didn't get most of them. And the writing is still high quality-- after finishing this book I started reading a book by another writer published in 2009 and I had to stop because found myself nitpicking almost every sentence as awkward or too literal or not descriptive enough or too wordy.The plot is threadbare- an overachieving, deceptively self-effacing writer with the kind of paranoias that overachieving people tend to have- is given an experience "to write about" by an Englishman she meets at a psychiatric conference in Vienna. After some agonizing, she decides to take it, a luxury afforded her by a permissive husband who's response to catching her cheating is not violence or abandonment but something that you'll have to read the book yourself to find out. As she goes through her trip with this guy she sprinkles on the literary references to prove her sophistication, sprinkles on the frank sexual passages, and you get to know her family, her first husband, and other background.It's one person's experience and it's not your experience or my experience. But it's pleasurable to read a book like this as long as the writing is so good. It does make you wish that all partners would be so understanding and that all sexual flings would result in "a 19th century ending."
A1C47YYIL4XVTX	1	1	Foxfire, is about a girl gang, members aged 13-17, that forms in a small blue collar town in Upstate New York from 1952-1956. The timeline and geography very much fits in with author Joyce Carol Oates' own youth, being born in 1938 she would have been the same age as these girls, and she grew up in western New York the first person in her family to finish high school.The 1950s are a great time for this novel because it really fits well with the mood of "The Wild One" (1953), "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955), "Blackboard Jungle" (1955), "West Side Story" (1957), "Beat Girl" (1960), the 1954 Senate Committee hearings on Junvenile Delinquency. It was a time before hard drugs made 'gang' synonymous with lucrative illegal business, when gangs were more innocent, more just about teenagers and kids "acting out." This is the female version of 1950s juvenile delinquency.Unlike JCO, the girls in this story come from broken families. As somebody who grew up in a stable, two-parent household in a upper middle class suburban area, it's difficult for me to understand where the girls in this gang are coming from. They never had a proper upbringing or role models to teach them between right and wrong. Their parents are uniformly failures, financially and personally. All the adults in town, particularly the men, are portrayed as lecherous, corrupt, unstable, promiscuous, and hypocritical. The girls have been abandoned, harassed, insulted, abused, beaten, raped, and generally failed by every possible source of authority in their lives, not only parents but teachers and police.Into this urban jungle swings in Margaret "Legs" Sadovsky, a teen runaway with a deceased mother and alcoholic father, who dodges police cars by jumping from rooftop to rooftop, cowers male gang members bigger and older than her with her switchblade, climbs 50-foot watertowers that none of the adults in town dare to, and recruits other girls like her to the gang "FOXFIRE." The purpose of the gang is pride and to take vengeance on all who wronged them. The girls are forced to find the courage to defend themselves, develop their sense of right and wrong, "make their own law", and distribute their own charity and activism in the town (such as when they protest outside a pet shop over the treatment of the animals inside).Basically, throw together the most difficult plausible scenario that could face teen girls in the US, up against the most spirited, intelligent and resourceful teen girl that you could plausibly imagine leading an "outlaw gang", and you have FOXFIRE. The FOXFIRE gang engages in many reprehensible acts including vandalism, theft, grand larceny, assault, burglary, arson, resisting arrest, extortion, kidnapping, every crime you could possibly think of, short of first degree murder. Yet, almost every time it seemed justified, the people they committed the crimes against almost all had it coming to them, in a way, and FOXFIRE never veers off into random violence. There are always strict limits, that are enforced even if doing so jeopardizes the existence of the gang and the freedom of the members. In the end, "Legs" and her gang still firmly retained the sympathy of this reviewer, despite all their crimes, which may attest to JCO's skill in creating a sympathetic portrait through the narrator, gang member "Maddy".One strange thing about this novel is that at one point, one of the girls paints a backwards swastika on a shop window. The swastika is actually drawn out on the pages of the book like an illustration. Why? Later, at the end, gang leader "Legs" proposes what she calls a "final solution". Although it had nothing to do with the holocaust, it was still bizarre, and unnatural. The only other book I've read by JCO contains a lot of anti-semitism where you wouldn't expect it. I'm not sure if this is a "thing" with this author or what. But it's a very minor part of the book, I have no idea what JCO was trying to communicate there, or even if there's any significance to those two details at all.Finally, the reader should note that some of the diction, sentence structure, and POV in the narrative is unconventional. If this bothers you, you should prepare yourself. Really, it does add to the edgy, outlaw, adolescent "mood" of the novel makes sense. Just decipher meaning one phrase at a time and you'll be fine.
A1C4IT3S7C53IK	1	1	I finally bought it on CD wore out my tape. Thanks for the prompt service
A1C4IT3S7C53IK	0	0	I have never seen U2 in concert but I do own all their DVD concerts. U2 live at the Rose Bowl is the first one I bought in the Blu-Ray format and I am very disappointed in the sound. I have a dedicated surround sound room that is set up for 7.1 and this concert has barely any bass coming from my subwoofer. A couple of times it comes in for a few seconds during It's A Beautiful Day and in part of Elevation but the rest of the concert has no body. I am tempted to buy the regular DVD version to see if it sounds any better. I do like the set list as a lot are from the new album but that is the only good thing about this release.U2: 360 at the Rose Bowl [Blu-ray]
A1C4O6BWVLB629	1	1	I massage horses for a living and this book added some new stretches to my library of stretches. Just be very very careful doing these on your horse.
A1C4O6BWVLB629	1	1	This is so much easier said than done but is a good read because it gets you thinking. It not only helps you but the horse also. Has aided me in my riding ability. Makes your ride more of a partnership than just a ride.
A1C4O6BWVLB629	1	1	I like to watch it over and over that is why I bought it. Has a good message along with good acting.
A1C4UROS33VHX5	1	1	As both authors are press people, it is not surprising that the most consistent criticism of this book is the lack of context and background. It is often said that news writers sacrifice the larger picture for the sake of detail. That also applies to news writers doing history.That said, this is a damn good book, primarily because of the details. For those thinking the account is too New York centric (after all the two authors come from the New York Times), all I can say is that the contributions from places other than New York and San Francisco (such as Minnesota and Miami) are acknowledged.However for me the biggest elephant in the room for this book is the almost total neglect of the news and popular media's role in the shaping of the gay movement. I always thought newspaper people like to talk about their business. But it seems that the authors prefer the "fly on the wall" position. And I think that is a bit dishonest.
A1C4UROS33VHX5	0	1	In his study Something Happened: A political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies, historian Edward Berkowitz attempts to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the 1970s. While other writers have dismissed the decade as a relatively chaotic interlude between the radical 1960s and Reaganite 1980s, he attempts to reconstruct the decade as an important and meaningful period in American history. He attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the political, cultural, economic and social events and developments of that decade. Unfortunately, he has no underlying argument or theme with which to bring together his large body of material and, as a result, the reader is given a series of chapters on economics, politics, etc that seem to have little connection among them. While the reader is given a lot of facts, the book attempts to make no large-scale interpretation or assessment of the decade as a whole.However even in giving the facts, much of the coverage is rather superficial. Much of the material is taken from secondary sources. Also the are some major errors (Nixon announced his resignation from office in August, not April. Pg. 30) and some minor ones (Seattle passed its gay rights law in 1973, not 1978. Pg 153. Voers defeated a referendum measure to repeal it in 1978.). That decade stills awaits an historian to give the definitive assessment of its place in American history.
A1C4UROS33VHX5	1	1	This is not your grandma's Figaro. At first I was surprised, then taken aback, then intrigued and then completely mesmerized. It's Figaro meets Psycho. The pacing is slower, more deliberate and the whole tone and atmosphere darker and more intense. And in the end, I think it works. The whole theme of this production is the maddening power of Eros (here portrayed by an extraneous character- a seductive non -speaking/singing young man dressed in school boy uniform with cherubic wings running around trying to manipulate all the characters) locked in a battle with "Love." In the end "Love" triumphs. (except for poor Cherubino who throughout the opera is portrayed as a poor young thing totally defenseless against the power of Eros--in the end he's reduced to a zombie). The singing and the technical quality I thought were first rate (It's a very recent production so it utilizes the latest in live sound recording..not like some of the older productions where the sound drifts when the singer moves in and out of microphone range).I think if you are not familiar with the more standard productions of Figaro, you'll have a hard time with this production, both in following the plot and understanding all the new meanings and interpretations that are being created. But if you already have seen a number of standard productions, I'd thing you may enjoy this, if not just for its strangeness. I doubt this production will ever replace the more standard production, but it sure made for an unexpected and interesting evening of opera.
A1C4UROS33VHX5	0	1	After reading David Walker Howe's excellent "What God Has Wrought: The Transformation of America, 18-15-1848" I begin looking at the other books in the Oxford History of the United States series. I saw David Kennedy's "Freedom from Fear" and assumed that it would be as well-written, broad and interesting as Howe's book. Big mistake!In spite of its subtitle "The American People in Depression and War: 1929-1945" Kennedy's book is mainly a history of the Roosevelt administration, its policies, and politics and a military history of World War II. As far as a history of the American people, there is very little of the social or cultural history that made Howe's book so interesting.As far as the political and military history of the Roosevelt administration, the writing is tedious, although I really don't find Kennedy to be overly biased one way or another.Overall a disappointment.
A1C50X8ZHRQSGI	1	1	I read this on vacation and thought it was a cute story. It was an easy read and a perfect addition to your beach bag. Not deep or compelling-- just a fun read.
A1C50X8ZHRQSGI	0	0	I was really disappointed by this book, given the great reviews. I found the characters not believable and the dialogue awkward. It was boring and I finally put it down after struggling through the first half of the book. Don't waste your summer on this one!
A1C50X8ZHRQSGI	0	0	I read &quot;Middlesex&quot; first and was disappointed by the &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot;. I did not find the sisters as engaging as I had hoped and struggled to get through this. I wouldn't spend the time on this one.
A1C50X8ZHRQSGI	1	1	I just read this book over holiday break and really enjoyed it. It is a quick read but has a great theme. I'd recommend it.
A1C50X8ZHRQSGI	1	1	I've been through several different bibs and these are by far the best! The velcro stays sticky, they are washable (and if they wind up in the dryer it doesn't get ruined) and they hold up well.
A1C548QIBFO1K	1	1	I love to have this in the morning before I go running. My husband has it for breakfast on the go, and midnight snack etc. Good value here on amazon...especially when you get free shipping. Go with the Milk Chocolate and not the Natural Chocolate Flavor.
A1C548QIBFO1K	1	1	I love this product...I have 3 in my house. It is great to get the plugs away from the wall when the outlet is in an inconvenient spot and great for lots of bulky power chargers! Also it has a surge suppressor...make sure to get the one with it, they also sell them without it.
A1C548QIBFO1K	1	1	The new version is worth the money. I got the 2001 (from the library) and 2009 version (from amazon). The 09 version is not only updated with the most current internet information (a lot has changed since 01 to make that version out of date), it is sequenced and ordered completely differently and includes "the parachute workbook" integrated into the text... no flipping back and forth through the appendices. I think every high school career class should use this book. It is great for any time in life, and I will use his principles/strategies for reflection on an ongoing basis. It definitely would have been helpful in picking my college major...I am going to recommend this to my younger sister, and keep using it myself.
A1C59C9SFCQRE8	1	1	Johannes Linstead has IT. That marvelous IT that so many guitar albums lack. He has a way of breezing us through his songs with a light, airy, toe-tapping smile - then punching in just enough gypsy passion to make you never forget he's a real player. Production levels, technical execution and most importantly - wise choices of drums, keys, guitar and layering, make the entire album approachable, yet really deep. This is one that will stay in my car, stay in my top picks on the iPod and become an old friend over time. Wonderfully warm and full of punch - yet reflective, moody and musically sound. Just love this album when I need a mental vacation on warm sunny beach! Great work!
A1C59C9SFCQRE8	1	1	This is Mick Fleetwood. A God among drummers. This is not just for drummers though. This DVD personifies what every musician, digital producer, singer and performer needs to know about being REAL and being a solid artist. A must have for drummers - and everyone else! Thanks for the depth and insight, Mick!!!!
A1C59C9SFCQRE8	1	1	Love the guy. Very funny. You have to have a true and dry British sense of humor to enjoy this to the max. Worth it!
A1C59C9SFCQRE8	0	0	if it doesn't stick to the batch floor it isn't good. It's too small to rub any area well. The whole thing has fake plastic bristles that don't really work. The center part here is made to be removable and you can buy an OPTIONAL soap dispenser? Really? REALLY? Try to get soap on your feet without the optional dispenser! Bad design. Good idea. Oddly I got the big single foot one for less also and that's fine. Sticks, bigger and better all around. Still need to get soap on your feet . . .
A1C5E4H8E0VS5S	1	1	I think this is the best book on Numerology that I have seen. Great info and very easy to work with.
A1C5E4H8E0VS5S	0	1	The style and design of the tables is very nice. I like itHowever, the packaging was not great, on each of the 4 tables there are noticable scratches and gouges in the table tops. Each table was covered with a plastic bag. No bubble wrap. it seems they were not packed for shipping.Disappointing to get the tables damaged.
A1C5E4H8E0VS5S	1	1	great, love it. its the perfect size for one cookie sheet and nothing sticks. I like it a lot. I then purchased a 2nd one. it fits in the dishwasher easily too.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	0	This is a book that is not intended to sit down and read from cover to cover. Instead, just open it up, browse to a team, and read what Rob Neyer has written.This is a must book for a baseball fan. If you like to sit with friends and discuss baseball teams and players then this book will give you good info.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	1	This is an excellant book. The authors write about the story of Fed Ex and how it was built and what it did to succeed. It also writes about companies who embed the Fed Ex culture into their company. You will enjoy.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	1	I do a lot of networking around town. It is often that I will meet people and share coffee with someone and then I will not continue to keep in touch with them. In the book Never Eat Alone Keith Ferrazzi writes about how to keep in touch with the people you know. He has creative ideas about working your circles, having productive social gatherings, networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	1	I have used this book to implement many new processes into my business. This sits in my bag or on my desk all the time. It's a great resource.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	1	This is an awesome bag. I bought this for my wife and she uses it all the time. Whenever I am on "Daddy Duty" I don't mind this bag at all. It's pretty cool.
A1C5K5BK5JEF19	1	1	For the price these are good ear phones. I can run with these in my ears and they work just fine.
A1C5K7IMCJ5P23	1	1	The reading of Fifth Business (of the Deptford trilogy) is a coming of age rite in Canada. No other work of Canadian fiction comes close to the style and psychological depth of the books in the Deptford Trilogy (Stone Angel by Laurence and In the Skin of a Lion by Ondaatje come close). The Manticore was in part responsible for turning me toward psychology as my undergraduate major. Robertson Davies fashioned other fine works after Fifth Business (The Cornish trilogy is sublime) but there is an aura that surrounds the Deptford Trilogy which is unique in literature. My office at the University of Toronto is not far from Massey College where Davies was chancellor, and where he &quot;set&quot; Rebel Angels. I think of him, or perhaps Parlabane from the Rebel Angels, as I pass it on the way to Davies' beloved Hart House. On cold winter nights I wish that I would find Davies' ghost gliding through the Hart House library, or rubbing its hands by the hearth in the reading room. I would beg him to tell me the plot of the fourth novel in the Deptford Trilogy.
A1C5K7IMCJ5P23	0	1	To paraphrase Jake Barnes, I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together. It was with this line that the character of Jake Barnes begins to coalesce into something definite. What cinches our sympathy with Jake is his tragic flaw, played out with lady Ashley and assorted other dames. In reading Dyer' book, you can't help but remember the Sun Also Rises, Hemingway's smashing novel about post war dissolution and dissipation in gay paree in the twenties. Indeed I was not surprised when Dyers reveals that he has been dropping bits of Sun into his own novel.There are many reasons that Dyers ambitious,and I think potentially important book is deeply flawed and fails to convey the poignancy and pathos that Sun conveyed. The most obvious is that he needed some real editing here. I picked up PT after reading and being deeply moved by the brilliant pseudo-memoirs of But Beautiful. The book was a marvel of pacing. I read it fairly soon after the masterful &quot;Coming Through Slaughter&quot; by Ondaatje, a paragon of the jazz pseudo-memoir. It held up against anything I have read by Ondaatje, and even Delillo. The pace was impeccable, and as good as any perfect short book-even Maxwell's &quot;So Long, See you Tommorrow&quot; which I think is perfectly paced. This sense of pacing and narrative was missing from PT. It gave a sense that the final edit was rushed. There is a gem in that book possibly several, and it deserved a better edit. Reading the book became trying to skip the poor, stilted dialogue, and the lack of narrative force to find small gems of wit and insight. I was startled at a descrisption of a Portugese landlord that seemed so like a former landlord of mine. I'll allow the clearly self indulgent sex scenes with the Nicole character-but the rest needed a good going over. The biggest flaw was the utter lack of any resonance between the characters and the reader. The narrator is poorly defined in relation to the protagonist. Unlike his influences, Fitzgerald and Hemingway, he fails to capture the complex fascination that narrators often have for the people whose lives they are recounting. The beauty of Nick and Jay is that Nick both reviles and is curiously seduced by Jay's image and style. The same can be said of Jake and Brett.In short, the book feels like a poor recreation or recounting of a far superior book which the author reveres. After reading But Beautiful, and being spellbound, PT is a strange dissapointment.On the whole, it is the best book I have ever not enjoyed.
A1C5K7IMCJ5P23	1	1	Let's Get Lost is one of the most haunting, visually evocative films ever made. It transcends genres. It is simply criminal that there is not a crystal clear, remastered dolby 5.1 surround version of this remarkable film on DVD! I would buy it for myself and send it as a gift to all my jazz and/or photographer friends!
A1C5PM9M7TRFE1	1	1	This product came very quickly after ordering it--long in time for a baby shower. The item was on a registry, so it is just what the parents-to-be asked for. The color is great, and the space saver chair is a great idea!
A1C5PM9M7TRFE1	1	1	I came across the song &#34;Night Time&#34; some time ago, so I purchased the CD for my grandson's first Christmas. The song evokes sweetness and adventure for little sleepyheads, and I hope he enjoys it! The other songs aren't as familiar to me (hence the 4 star rating), but I hope his parents will find the CD enjoyable enough to play for their baby.
A1C66BHY539NOO	0	0	I have read several of the Morgan's Mercenaries books and found this one to be lacking in many areas. The story is depressing and the lack of in depth character development makes it difficult to be sympathetic to their plight. You start not caring after awhile and the characters are just annoying. There is none of the "action and adventure" that is in the other books in the series. This whole story can be boiled down into a couple paragraphs as restated as background information in several of the other books. Read the rest of the series instead.
A1C66BHY539NOO	1	1	I got hooked on the first one and its great to have another wonderful book to add to the series. Makes you look at weather in a whole new way!
A1C66BHY539NOO	1	1	John Taylor is the man. Shades of XFiles, Supernatural, a detective story and a wicked sense of humor all rolled up one. Just the first of many great books in the series.
A1C66BHY539NOO	1	1	Great books to help teach primary kids the concept of adjectives (describing words, word choice). The pictures and the silly "riddles" are wonderful. For example: The quietest thing in the world is a worm in eating peanut butter. Students will love to make up their own "Most Thing".
A1C66BHY539NOO	0	1	I loved all the Kay Scarpetta books. That is until I got to this one. Writing it from a narrator point of view instead of Kay's perspective like the others, makes reading this book very strange. I tried valiantly to put that aside but couldn't even get through the first 50 pages before I gave up. I hope that future books go back to the way they were before because Blow Fly definitely wasn't good.
A1C66BHY539NOO	1	1	I enjoyed this book from Lindsay McKenna. The characters were likeable and the plot was interesting. The only draw back was the excessive use of Reckon, gal and other "hillbilly" word usage which got in the way of some of the conversations. Other than that, enjoyable book to read!
A1C6CUSH37OFC3	1	1	Everywhere we are bombarded with false statistics that are invented and propogated by the AA followers.The fact remains that the MOST sucessful people to quit their addictions do it on their own-please see the Harvard News Letter.Dr. Ellis' book can and does augment peoples ability to quit,for good,their self destuctive tendancies including substance abuse.Factual analysis of the why we become addicted are presented here in an easy to understand format.It is our irrational beliefs about ourselves and the world that lead to frustration,depression and addiction.I practise this philosophy daily in dealing with my husbands' cancer and my own patients illnesses.It calms me and helps me to deal with life on lifes terms and not the way it should be.If you rely on your ability to think to lead you through life then this book is a great way to help structure your thoughts into a benefical program not only for substance abuse but for accepting whatever life may throw at you at any moment.
A1C6CUSH37OFC3	1	1	Anyone who is a loyal reader of DK novels knows he is an avid dog lover,especially when it comes to Trixie.One of my favorite novels is Watchers.Not so much because of the monster and action sequences but because the character of Einstein.He is what all dog worshippers wish we could have, even for one day.Which would be to communicate with our furry loved ones.Trixie(DK) does a great job in trying to tell us what her priorities and her life is all about.At times very funny and ironic,this book does a great job of letting us look back at ourselves and to realize how utterly goofy we humans are.
A1C6CUSH37OFC3	1	1	Anyone whe believes that DOG spelled backwards is not just a happy coincidence will love these photo's.Like many, I have the feeling that dogs are spiritual beings,much like ourselves.The only unaswerable question is this;were dogs put on this planet for our companionship and benefit of is it the other way around.Either way these photo's show what dog worshippers everywhere already know.That dogs are sentient being with their own individual personalities.
A1C6FSC0C381EJ	0	0	First and foremost.......... THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DRAGON BALL EXCEPT for its title. The story has been changed radically and have turned a great anime into a SOAP OPERA movie, the protagonist actor Justin CHatwick is the worst choice to play Goku, horrible acting, horrible script........ they turned Goku into a regular guy that only thinks in how to hook up with girls ......????????......... the rest of the characters have been changed too, not only they look completely different, but their behavior in this movie is almost the opposite of the real dragon ball anime.You've been warned, if you are a fan of the Dragon Ball anime, in this movie you WILL NOT FIND any of the plot, characters or personalities that you loved from the anime, and you will feel really upset that you wasted your money on this.And if you are not a fan of Dragon Ball anime, you STILL WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, because even as a movie it doesn't make any sense, no character development, stupid one-liners, and mediocre effects.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CRAPPIEST MOVIE, and if you want TRUE Dragon Ball buy the anime dvd instead.
A1C6FSC0C381EJ	1	1	I love the resident evil series, specially RE 2 and 4. And I truly love this Blu Ray movie. The best Resident Evil movie I've seen so far. There are so many awesome moments and elements from all resident evil games (1-5). I recommend this movie to everyone. And if you are a RE fan, what are you waiting for? Buy it now. 5 Stars !!!! Hopefully they make another movie :D
A1C6GZKSJHOXZV	0	0	It's just a fluffy piece of "literature" that tells girls to be nice. Girl Scouts already know this. I wouldn't waste my money on it again.
A1C6GZKSJHOXZV	1	1	This is the set that got us started on our own sushi roll making adventures! I love having the package together to get me started, as the oriental grocery stores in the nearby city can be a little daunting. Buy this to begin your sushi making along with this bookSushi For Dummies. You'll probably want the physical book because you'll want to have it on hand when actually ROLLING the sushi and your fingers will be so dirty, you won't want to mess up your kindle.
A1C70X7W2U77LE	1	1	If you like Harry Potter, this is a must see! you will enjoy every moment of it!
A1C70X7W2U77LE	1	1	I think it could be better if I listen someone talking... however since it is like reading in Spanish, I'm good at it or thats what my bf says... So far is its fun! I will keep learning :D
A1C70X7W2U77LE	0	1	I like better Winsor pilates... I gave this one away, but the good thing is Pilates work!
A1C70X7W2U77LE	1	1	I think this film is funny, but I must say a little bit unreal. It is like she wants to make every girl fat? that is not even healthy! but I do believe we all are beautiful and it doesnt matter if youre fat or skinny how you feel is what you will reflect.
A1C70X7W2U77LE	1	1	Great movie, I love JLO's and Marc combination! they are a great couple! The movie was awesome! Jennifer Lopez performance is one of the best! Thumbs up!
A1C719NG46JS3O	1	1	I was just discovering Led Zeppelin properly around the time of their concert in Knebworth UK back in 1979. I owned virtually all their albums until 1984 but sold all my vinyl back then-eighty five albums including a Japanese version of "The Song Remains the Same"Well,I subsequently repurchased every Zep album on CD and had heard rumours of a new live album. I was fortunate enough to hear Jimmy Page being interviewed on Radio 1 at the time of it's release and heard "Black Dog" I was blown away!A purchase soon happened and can confirm it is simply the best live album in my collection. It encompasses most of the tracks which made Zeppplin so huge. As for the sound quality, I don't know what incantation Jimmy Page chanted but whatever it was it worked...STUNNING CLARITY,sounded like is was recorded yesterday.Sadly, the packaging didn't quite match the quality of the album. A limp cover design which should have included shots of the concerts in question.That is the only moan, this album is perfect otherwise and worth ten times the asking price.Why oh why Mr Page did you keep me waiting 25 years!
A1C719NG46JS3O	1	1	I purchased the original album back in 1979 after hearing snippetts of it on a local radio show. I was just getting into rock and quite honestly had never heard of UFO. Absolutly awesome and was my most played album. Well a lot of things happened since then and in 1984 I sold my entire Vinyl collection (SOB!)- UFO were no more!Well back in June 2004 I finally purchased a PC,discovered Napster and started rediscovering some long lost treasure which included Strangers in the Night. It came up fresh as a daisy-just as good as back in '79 when I first heard it.After much searching I finally located the "Expanded Edition" and paid just under 20 for it.Listening to it, I noticed the improvement in quality over the well worn vinyl I had and the two extra tracks were certainly a bonus.Hot'N'Ready is superb.Sadly, I wasn't over impressed with the packaging-an awful lot more could have been done here regarding photos,sleeve notes and presentation and I'm still getting my head around the revised running order. I would agree that the original running order was more coherent and why not present it in hybrid SACD Format?These foibles aside, this represents UFO at their awesome best. There isn't a single bad track on it, the remastering has delivered eye-watering clarity and is in my opinion an essential buy even at twice the price I paid for it.
A1C7CJHPAO5UO1	0	1	What age range is the book appropriate for?Poor Horton -- They beat him. They maul him. And try to cage him. And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"Not the best bed-time story.
A1C7CJHPAO5UO1	1	1	They do what they're supposed to do. :-) No leaks.Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" plan is very convenient. I wonder if UPS is tired of delivering them every few weeks?
A1C7CJHPAO5UO1	1	1	Our Samsung printer is still working great after 4 years.We're on our 3rd toner cartridge, which isn't bad. The toner always works fine, and even prints many pages after the printer says "Toner Low" and "Toner Empty".If you remove the toner and shake it a bit, you can get more pages from it, but sometimes a bit of black toner leaks out if you shake it hard.
A1C7CJHPAO5UO1	1	0	At first I thought they would get bored, but no... they LOVE it! They can build for hours, making houses, garages, buildings, or just stacking the blocks. (Ages 4-6)Note that the item is heavy (21 lbs), so be sure to get free shipping, or the shipping will cost almost as much as the blocks!
A1C7M8BV77I1E0	0	1	Based on the picture, I thought that this super long cord would have come with the ends that go from one device to the other. It did not. So I now have all of this wire when I should have just gone to Wal-Mart and purchased a 50Ft patch cord with the ends in tact. I did go to Wal-Mart and I'm satisfied. I'm hoping that some network person will express an interest in the useless cable that I now posess.
A1C7OND1J2PFEE	1	1	I have an office in my attic space that was converted to living space. But my cable Internet was not strong enough to make a direct connection with the router in that area. Hence, I bought this wireless card for the PC. Though the antenna is not positioned ideally, I was delighted that the hardware installation went so smoothly. However, the software installation did not go as smoothly. I had many compatibility issue and failed starts. Suffice it to say, after some tweaking, I got the software installed and configured without resorting to a phone call. Now it works fine after clicking through some pop-up error screens on startup.
A1C7OND1J2PFEE	1	1	I saved my pennies for nearly a year to get this. My hands shook as I opened it. I was pleased with the whole process of transferring files. iTunes loaded as expected and the transfer went off without a hitch. I joined Audible and ported the books without incident. The device is fairly user friendly and fits comfortably in my pocket. Many people complain about scratching. I could care less about the scratches. Mine is scratched up, but it gives it character. My biggest complaint is power. The battery won't last a day. Constantly needs charging. Other than that, I love it.
A1C7OND1J2PFEE	1	0	I have the fifth generation 80 GB and couldn't stand it because the battery would die within an hour of starting to use it. I bought this one as a replacement (reluctantly) and found it is much, much better. The battery life is phenomenal and it's just as easy to use as previous models. The only thing I don't like is the split screen previews. I have yet to figure out how to get rid of them.
A1C7SMAF0LJDBG	1	1	I'm quite happy with these and writing to say so, because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial: i.e., though diminutive, they have bulk so are visible, with nice warm glow.
A1C7SMAF0LJDBG	0	1	I returned this--absolutely unusable. Could not keep bottle engaged WHILE pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms.
A1C7SMAF0LJDBG	1	0	I returned these, because they were too large for me. To be fair to Zina, they were as described, and I wasn't sure they would work. The only reason I'm not rating them a 5 is that, having returned them, I don't know how long the clasp would work.I kept gold small hoops I bought at same time--very happy with them. Zina's product descriptions are exceptionally good.
A1C7SMAF0LJDBG	0	0	I love Blessac products and was expecting a replacement package as shown in the picture. The item I received is not what is shown, and nowhere does the package say "Blessac." Very disappointing! I'll use it instead of going through the delay and bother of sending it back.
A1C8GNTZJJ9UKF	1	1	Her books are always action packed with a little bit of humor. I thought it was a good wrap up to story lines used in the background of some of her other books.
A1C8TIW102KXDI	1	1	I am Sam is a wonderful story about a mentally disabled father's struggle for custody of his daughter. Sam, played brilliantly by Sean Penn, must prove that although he is disabled, he is capable of caring for his daughter. Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning are a completely believable father-daughter pair. This movie is funny, sad, and altogether amazing, it's a great movie that's impossible not to like!
A1C8TIW102KXDI	1	1	This is a powerful movie for anyone interested in history/African politics. The Last King of Scotland follows the life of a fictional Scottish man who becomes the personal doctor and adviser to Ugandan president, Idi Amin. The plot is gripping and moves quickly between action scenes and political dialogue. Forest Whitaker's performance is amazing and very frightening at times. He definitely deserved winning the Oscar for Best Actor!WARNING! It is correctly rated R for disturbing images, please take this into consideration.
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	&quot;American Life&quot; Is one of those albums which you have to get used to. I listened to it all the time when I first heard it but kind of got bored of it. Then recently i played it all the way though and was able to listen to it without skipping a track. In keeping with the same techno/electronica theme of &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; Madonna gives us some of her most personal lyrics to date. The title track is a great song with her kind of &quot;rapping&quot; which is really cool. My favorite track is &quot;nothign fails&quot;... one of Madonna's BEST songs. She talks about her life on this album. &quot;Mother And Father&quot; is so sad it almost makes you cry and &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; shows how she did some things in her life she regretted. The song &quot;Hollywood' has a chilling warning to people ready to be stars. Overall if you're a Madonna fan GET THIS ALBUM. You will not regret it. Do not be fooled by the 'Explicit Lyrics' on the cover. I think thats why a lot of people were turned off by it. The only song with 'Explicit Lyrics' was really the title track &quot;American Life.&quot; Another highlight is the hit single (why werent any of the others hits?!?!) &quot;Die Another Day&quot; which has great instrumentation. Also reccomended: &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	Now they're all off on solo ventures, but back in the day DC4 ruled the charts with hits like "No No No Part II." Their self-titled debut is probably one of their best CD's... tied with "The Writings on the Wall." It has many Gospel and R&B influences. If you liked "Jumpin Jumpin" from their 2nd album you will like it's cousin the Jermaine Dupri-produced "With Me" parts I and II (just the same with extended raps). There are a lot more shared vocals and young Beyonce sounds great. It sounds a lot more harmonic then the other albums, kind of like old school En Vogue. Wyclef Jean fans will enjoy the remix of "no No No" which was a hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts but not so much on the pop charts. If you like PURE R&B and NOT POP CROSSOVERS get their debut. It takes some time getting used to, but it will end up being one of your favorite discs and is surprisingly good music to put on the background when you have guests over. Whenever that happens I always get "this is destiny's child?!" That's right. This is their debut and I/M/O their best CD. Also reccomended: "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	Seriously, if teenage girls looked back to 1985, 1989 and 1990 when Whitney, Mariah and Celine all released thier debuts, you know there is nothing new with Kelly. The truth is even though she is pretty hot her vocals are mediocore. She can do the shouting thing but to dub her as &quot;the next mariah carey&quot; is a disgrace to Mariah. And Celine Dion?! Please! kelly's high notes are very weak. You can hear that in &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Miss Independent.&quot; This record was done for SALES ONLY... nothing from the heart. It needs to be more xperimental and less Clive, David Foster and Diane Warren stuff. &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; is a much better example of pop with great vocals. Same with &quot;Mariah Carey.&quot; Let's see... she borrowed a song off Christina, put on bland material like &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; (C-L-I-C-H-E!!), let Diane Warren repeat herself again and put Tamyra in who deserved to win! If I didn't know this was Kelly, I thought it would be an artist like Pink or Christina Aguilera. She is very average and has the ego the size of Texas. She needs to come back to earth and record something DECENT if she wants my respect. Ditch Clive, Kelly. Check out Desmond Child, Shek'spere, Kandi Buruss, DarkChild or God forbid pen your own songs YOURSELF and have them based on personal experiences. Check out LeAnn Rimese's &quot;twisted angel&quot; instead You will be forever greatful.
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	What a lot of the critics and long time fans didn't seem to understand is... this was not a personal album for her. She didn't make it clear enough that 'Glitter" was a soundtrack to the accompanying film of the same title. It's a shame it didn't top her previous sales when it is just as good if not better then her previous multi-platnum albums. In fact... this is an album that prooves all that glitters IS gold ("Glitter" went Gold after being popular in Asia and Brazil). The leading single "loverboy" is reminiscent of "Heartbreaker" and failed misrably on the charts. It's amazing how much people enjoy slamming others because of their physical/mental exhaustion. The ballad "Never Too Far" is a standout amongst her previous works like "Hero" and "One Sweet Day." Another thing I don't get about the reviews is people complaining about all the samples. First off, she has been sampling since "Music Box" ("Dreamlover" sampled an old school song too). And also, there's nothing wrong with sampling. Instead of putting the original songs in a soundtrack, she re-worked them and made them her own as all unique songs. "Don't Stop (Funkin 4 Jamaica)" featuring Mystikal will be sure to get the party going and I can't believe it wasn't a summer hit! I think she should have had a P Diddy remix to "Want You" because the original version featuring Eric Benet (husband of Halle Barrie) is just groovy! "All My Life" Is a great funky remake of a Rick James song. People will get to the dance floor with the addictive "If We" featuring Ja Rule and Nate Dogg as well as the sexy "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life." Some of her best ballads are on "Glitter', including the spine-tingling "Lead The Way" Where she seems to hit one of the longest notes ever held and the piano-driven "Reflections (Care Enough)." Production on the album comes courtesy of DJ Clue and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. I REALLY reccomend "Glitter" to anyone who wants to get the party going. Also reccomended: Willa Ford's "Willa Was Here" and Mariah Carey's other hip-hop joint "Rainbow."
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	I never was a fan of the Dixie Chicks until I saw the video for &quot;Landslide&quot; at school on CMT and fell in love with them. Political differences aside, this is a REALLY great listen from start-to-finish. Some accuse the Chicks of being too &quot;pop&quot; when I disagree. First off, there is NOTHING pop about this album. There is NO digital synthesizer, just original live instruments that make you feel like you're sitting with them at the studio. Natalie's vocals are amazing and are very underrated in the female country world. I've only listened to WOS a few times but I am liking it more and more. If you liked &quot;Home&quot; but still are clammoring for more percussion and a more Nashville feel then check out this great album. My favorite songs are &quot;Once You Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; and the opening single &quot;I Can Love You Better.&quot; Even though &quot;Thank Heavens for Dale Evans&quot; was their ORIGINAL debut, &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; is what made Dixie Chicks as household name. I urge ANYONE to buy this, even if you disagreed with their statements about the President. They're still at the top of their game and I can only imagine what they'll release next! Also reccomended: &quot;Fly&quot;
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	&quot;The bodyguard&quot; probably shows Ms Houston in the pinnacle of her career. Her vocals have finally matured and sound better then ever. The powerhouse megahit &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; originally written/sung by Dolly Parton spent over 14 weeks at the number one chart, making it one of the longest number one hits on the charts. David Foster is the primary producer of her radio hits, doing his best and succeeds at imitating &quot;Babyface&quot;'s work. The highlights are obviously Whitney's hits, such as the soulful &quot;Run To You&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing.&quot; I also enjoy the down-right FUNKY remake of Chaka Kahn's &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; as well as the sassy powerhouse hit &quot;Queen of the Night.&quot; The second half of the album features such artists as famed Saxophonist Kenny G, soul legend Aaron Neville and her mother Cissy Houston. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; shows Whitney's voice at her best, and the Gospel track &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; prooves that as well. I really reccomend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoyed the radio hits and is clammoring for more Whitney!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	Sure, she may not shout like Whitney or Mariah or Celine, but does that mean Jennifer has a bad voice? Absolutely, not! I am appalled at all the bad reviews and I wonder if any of the reviewers actually listened to this CD before writing it. Anyways, &quot;This Is Me...Then&quot; is a great mix of Pop tunes with a 70's feel to it. The hits include the sassy &quot;All I have&quot; featuring LL Cool J and the catchy &quot;Jenny From The Block.&quot; Cory Rooney is a very versatile producer and does the whole album. A highlight track is also the current hit single &quot;Baby I Love U&quot; which is so darn catchy and has a retro feel to it. I also love the beautiful &quot;Still&quot; and the catchy &quot;One&quot; (parts one and two). Even though it's kind of cheezy, &quot;Dear Ben&quot; is kind of catchy and I like the music. Jenny covers the Carly Simon classic &quot;You Belong To Me&quot; and does a pretty good job, giving the album a more retro feel. While the music isn't as upbeat as &quot;J Lo&quot; or as Latin as &quot;On The 6&quot;, &quot;This Is Me...Then&quot; is a great mix of uptempo and slow ballads. If you enjoyed her radio singles and are an open-minded music lover then pick up &quot;This Is Me...Then.&quot; Don't write a bad review without listening to it first!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	&quot;Forever and Foralways&quot; is a sweet, catchy ballad written by Shania from her recent release, &quot;Up!&quot; It's a shame &quot;Up!&quot; didn't do as well as her previous efforts, but with internet pirating and downloading programs it's no wonder the sales have gone down. Anyways, This is a great CD single for Shania fans! It includes the Red (Pop) version of &quot;Forever and Foralways&quot; as well as a great live version of the 1999 hit &quot;That Don't Impress Me Much&quot; prooving she can sing on stage as well as in the studio. Also included is a live version of the title track from her 1998 album &quot;Come On Over&quot; also live and an enhanced video of &quot;Forever and Foralways.&quot; I wish &quot;Forever And Foralways&quot; crossed over more to the Pop charts but at leased Shania has her fans to support her! Way to go and thanks for this CD-single!!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	"Music Box" is one of her best and most succesful albums. I think my version has some more tracks then the listing on amazon.com but then again I got it as a cassette in 3rd grade. Mine has some uptempo dance tracks as well as the beautiful ballads and utptempo numbers. "Dreamlover" marks her longest running number one hit spending at leased 12 weeks at the top of the charts. Another number one hit is "Hero' which is definately one of her best songs and is a signature song from her. My favorite song is the overlooked Top 10 hit "Anytime You Need A Friend" where she sounds amazing! If you liked "My All" then you'll like the beautiful "Just To Hold You Once Again" which is similar. Another highlight is the hit remake "Without You" which is just beautiful. I Really reccomend "Music Box" to Mariah Carey fans as well as casual fans who liked her radio hits. This is great driving music cause it has a mix of slow and uptempo songs, but some of them sound kind of dated, but still a great CD! I also reccomend "Butterfly"!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	I really enjoyed &quot;Rainbow&quot; when it came out and can still listen to it to this very day! &quot;Rainbow' also got more number one hits for her including &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Thank God I Found You.&quot; Diane Warren co-writes the inspiring &quot;Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)&quot; as well as the Latin-flavored &quot;After Tonight.&quot; My favorite song is &quot;Heartbreker (Remix)&quot;, &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot; and the remake of the Phil Collins classic &quot;Against All Odds.&quot; If you like the more hip-hop Mariah then this is a good album to start out with. Also reccomended is &quot;Glitter.&quot; Thanks for this album , Mariah... it's one of my favorites!!!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	While it was majorly played out this past spring, I really enjoyed her duet with LL Cool J On &quot;All I Have.&quot; The chorus is catchy and LL's raps are really good. The production courtesy of Corey Roony is excellent and the sampling of &quot;Loving Life and Life is Living!&quot; is really fun to sing along to. Catchy hooks and danceable beats give two thumbs up from me! This is her best collabo since &quot;Ain't It Funny Remix.&quot;
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	I tell ya, &quot;Love Hurts&quot; is a great album by Cher. First off, I ordered this NEW and the cover was different then the one shown on the amazon.com website. It's just a picture of her upper body alone with maroonish hair. That aside, I really enjoy this album. &quot;Save Up All Your Tears&quot; was a moderate hit but still not as big as the hits from her album before this &quot;Heart of Stone.&quot; While &quot;Love Hurts&quot; includes some filler tricks, the standout tracks REALLY make up for the so-so ones. Of course the Warren/Desmond Child hit is a highlight, but the title track is so beautiful and retro-ish it kind of reminds me of an Elvis song. Cher kind of reminds me of Elvis when she sings that song. Another showstopper is the incredible &quot;I'll Never Stop Loving You&quot; where I think she is talking about Sonny Bono. I also enjoy the other hit from the album &quot;Love And Understanding&quot; which is one of her most underrated songs and definately grows on you. My other favorite is &quot;Could've Been You&quot; which kind of has the same beat as Rickie Lee Jones's hit &quot;Special&quot; (I think that's the title?). &quot;Love Hurts&quot; was released in 1991 and during that time other newcomers were coming onto the scene, taking Cher's incarnation as &quot;Rock Queen&quot; out of the spotlight. Even so, &quot;Love Hurts&quot; still has an 80's rock/Adult Contemporary sound to it. I reccomend this album for anyone who wants good quality Rock/Pop songs and/or likes Cher in general!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	This is one of the best rap songs of 2003, along with Fabolous's &quot;Can't Let U Go&quot; (With Lil' Mo). I totally dig the beats from JD &amp; SoSo Def. I think Da Brat should've had her longtime friend Mariah Carey to sing the vocals but it's still a hot joint and definately gets ppl bumpin in the clubs! Da Brat shows what real hip-hop is to the crowd even if it's a tad commercial. It's too bad she hasn't had another hit single but this was definately one of this summer's hottest hits. Also check out Fabolous's single &quot;Can't Let U Go.&quot;
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	Why are we hating on Hilary? number one- she cant act (Amanda Bynes is a good actress, not hillary!). Number two- she can't sing. She used the people from Avril Lavigne's disaster to cover up poor (to say the least) vocals. Hilary makes J Lo sound like Whitney Houston. Sorry Whitney, but I had to make that analogy. I love you though! No not you Hilary. You can't sing. You can't act. That is why people are &quot;hating&quot; on you. Maybe if you had more serious roles besides ditzy blonde teenage girls I would give you more repsect but you don't. The only good character on &quot;lizzie mcguire&quot; is her brother cause hes so funny but other then that the show is an embarasment. I feel so sad for the grown up actors. I wish someone would take yours and Aaron Carter's CD's and send them up in space like one other reviewer stated. Hilary, listen. I'm sure you're pretty and all but they just chose you on Disney cause of your looks. What were you when the show started out, 8? You are no Amanda Bynes. And I'm sure she can sing better too. As for the CD... do I need to say something? Nope. You know it's bad. Get something by LeAnn Rimes instead. That teenage chick can really SING!!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	I got to watch some of &quot;American Juniors&quot; and I was amased at KATELYN TARVER and AJ MELENDEZ's voices! They did n ot go with the rest of the group. They belonged with the original &quot;American Idol&quot; singers. They were better then some of the AI II contestants *cough cough, Josh Gracin and Clay Aiken* Too bad they didnt wait until they were 16. I hope you two are reading this because if you release albums I *WILL* buy them. Screw Kelly Clarkson. Katelyn Tarver is all that. Screw Clay. AJ is one of the best male vocalists out there. I GIVE YOU ALL MAD PROPS!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	This is one of the best rap singles ever. The beats are hot, busta's raps are TIGHT and Janet's chemistry with him is just awsome! It's one of my favorite rap singles in addition to Lauryn Hill's &quot;Doo Wop (ThaT ThinG).&quot; highlight reccomended!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	1	the fact that people consider this disc &quot;R&amp;B&quot; is beyond. are people forgetting they were once a teenybopper pop group? i am amused at one reviewer who is what 30 something and likes NSYNC? Sorry Richard but i'm 20 and i happen to hate NSYNC. always have and always will. while i dont like the backstreet boys at leased they dont try to be something they're not. when i saw the video for &quot;girlfriend&quot; i was cracking up! since when were NSYNC &quot;Street thugs&quot;? you can obviously tell they've been changed to market towards BOTH MTV *and* BET. Justin's voice being soulful? his voice is a step up from a squaking rat. It would be better if he wasnt so nasal and didnt sing so darn high! &quot;Gone&quot; might as well be called Justin with backup vocals. I mean at leased Destiny's Child's first CD and En Vogue's CD had HARMONIES in them. Same with Boyz II Men and BackStreet. NSYNC might as well be called JUSTIN with Backup vocals. JC is the better singer but Justin is always in the spotlight. Sick of him too? E-mail me about it! PePsI987@yahoo.com Holla!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	&quot;Come On Over&quot; was virtually a perfect album. It had the right mix of pop and rock. It sold over 33 million copies and broke records. What did Shania do wrong this time? Since 'Come On Over' produced cross-over hits she has gained many more fans both country and non-country listeners. The only problem is, she hasn't chosen a genre, or is marketing too much for different genres. Some of the songs on &quot;Up!&quot; sound good on the GREEN disc (country versions) and some on the RED (pop). The production isn't as good as &quot;Come On Over.&quot; The first few songs seem the most country-ish &quot;She's Not Just A Pretty Face&quot; excluded. &quot;Juanita&quot; is probably an example of country perfection. The chorus is great and it's in a Latin-style. I really smell hit single on this. it Also sounds better on the Country disc. Many of the songs towards the end don't really stand out and are repititions of each other, such as &quot;In My Car (I'll Be The Driver)&quot;, &quot;Waiter, Bring Me Water!&quot; and &quot;I'm Not In The Mood (To Say No!)&quot; Personally I like &quot;I'm Not In The Mood...&quot; the best. &quot;Aint No Particular Way&quot; brings back the Shania we all know and love and sounds great on the country disc as well as the catchy hit single &quot;Gonna Getcha Good!&quot; &quot;Up!&quot; the title track is kind of an introduction to the album. &quot;Forever And Foralways&quot; is a great update from her other hit &quot;You're Still The One.&quot; &quot;It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing&quot; is a minor repitition of &quot;Forever and Foralways&quot; and could have been cut. Other highlights include the catchy &quot;Nah!&quot;, the beautifully poetic &quot;I'm Jealous&quot;, &quot;I Aint Goin Down&quot; (Pure country!) and &quot;What A Way To Wannabe.&quot; Otherwise this album includes a little too many osngs that are fun to listen to only as background music. It's too bad she devided the albums. I reccomend putting the RED and GREEN disc and setting your stereo on SHUFFLE, so it goes back and forth and you can hear the different versions. The import also includes world mixes of the tracklisting. I wish she would've took more time to combine all the tracks with country and pop perfectly like she did with &quot;Come On Over.&quot; Otherwise I'd still reccomend this to both POP *and* COUNTRY fans.
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	Thank you cranky_reviewer for your intellectual e-mail. For that I decided to give &quot;Girlfriend&quot; another 1 star review for NSTINK. Maybe you'll realize how much they stink?
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	LeAnn's latest release hasn't gotten the amount of promotion it deserves. She scored big in the past with Diane Warren-written hits like &quot;Can't Fight From The Moonlight&quot; and &quot;How Do I Live&quot; (both from soundtracks). She's always been more of a crossover artist but with country roots (her main identity is country). The trouble with &quot;Twisted Angel&quot; is that she steers away from the acoustic musical backgrounds that once accompanied her beautiful, angelic and when sometimes called upon-powerful vocals. Anyways, due to the trend of recycled cookie cutter R&amp;B and hip-hop, &quot;Life Goes On&quot; failed to top the Pop charts. The bone I had to pick with her is that the video version (country) is NOT on this album. Rather, it's a Pop/R&amp;B-wannabe song with the same vocals but fails in comparison to the radio version. Another poor choice of her was to issue the completely laughable &quot;Tic Toc&quot; as the next single. The highlights from &quot;Twisted Angel&quot; are the title track, which displays R&amp;B soul never befoe heard from her. &quot;Damn&quot; was a worthy single full of live instrumentation, great songwriting and powerful vocals. &quot;Wound Up&quot; is another laughable track. Her voice shines on the single-worthy, piano-driven balled &quot;Love Is An Army&quot; which goes back to her country roots. It also continues to the next track &quot;You Made Me Find Myself.&quot; What saves this album from being a mess of repetitive Desmond Child tracks is, #1: Her amazing vocals and #2 The personal lyrics (she co-wrote many of them on this album). While it doesn't top her previous Country releases, &quot;Twisted Angel&quot; is sure to please the listener, country or Pop. Also reccomended is Shania Twain's &quot;Up!&quot;
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	I should have known Mr Mayer would release a second album. When I heard the completely laughable, egotistical &quot;Bigger Then My Body&quot; (then saw the laughable 'performance&quot; on SNL) it made me wonder what the requirements for a record deal are anymore. I used to think it was about talent, but ya know, whatever. He reminds me of that kid in high school who started a mediocore band and had horrible vocals. Hopefully he'll realize how pathetic his &quot;career&quot; is and leave it to talented peopel like Dave MAthhew's older stuff and Eric Clapton.
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	I really liked his album &quot;Crash&quot; and his sophomore album with &quot;Stay&quot; (my favorite song by his band). Even &quot;I Did It&quot; was pretty cool. But while they had good songs, all DMB did was repeat themselves. They have their limits and the music prooves it. I respect them as a band but they need to be more innovative. This record along with its singles will probably flop. Buy &quot;Crash&quot; instead.
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	0	She was hardly in any movies before this. isn't that what the Academy Awards is supposed to be about? You have to earn your oscar not be pushed by the NAACP because no blacks have been chosen yet (I think Will Smith deserved the fist black male oscar for &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;). For example, while Queen Latifah was just as good as Katherine Zeta-Jones in &quot;Chicago&quot;, Katherine has been in a lot more films and is more distinguished. Same with Nicole Kidman rightfully beating Renee Zellweager (Sp?). I think this film was totally overrated and the story is boring and predictable. I also dont see the big hype about Halle Barry. her acting isn't even that good. If you want a good black female actress check out Vanessa Williams on the new TV series &quot;Boomtown.&quot; Totally underrated!!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	0	1	this book is what's wrong with our youth. the fact that I was embarassed last summer at work because i was a virgin is beyond me. this book says to teenagers "look, forget about love it's about sex!" i cannot beleive my school had a sex education class... IN 9th GRADE! i hope it' s not too late for parents to look at what their children are doing to themselves. Sex is of constant talk in the teenage youth and the pressure is far beyond what most parents are in denial about. The rap music thats so popular isnt making it much better, either. Ever listen to what your teen listens to? the lyrics? Ever watch MTV with them? Would you watch MTV with them? Look at the "role models" of our younger society (50 cent, britney spears, etc). i can't believe people bought this book for their teens. if i were a parent i would not make the same mistake mine did by allowing a school to teach me at age 14 how to put condoms on. the far less you know, the most likely you'll be able to stay away with it! and please, start putting good music into your teen's heads!!
A1C8XITTTCYEI9	1	1	I was a fan of the original revival recording with Bebe Neuwirth, so when I went to see the movie in Theatres, I was a little skeptical on whether it would be as good as the original stage version. In fact, the film is just as good if not BETTER then the stage version. All the acting is really good, and the plot is much better then other modern movie musicals (cough cough, Moulin Rouge). If you're a fan of the movie &quot;Cabaret&quot; then you'll love &quot;Chicago&quot; written by the same people (Kander and Ebb). Velma (Katherine Zeta-Jones) starts it out with the opening number sure to stick in your head throughout the show and when you leave. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) sees Velma on the vaudville stage and she is determined to become a star. A warning to parents, this is a dark comedy not meant for children under 16. Being that the comedy itself falls around Roxie killing her husband because she's furious, most of it takes place in Jail where we meet Matron &quot;mama&quot; Morton (Queen Latifah), one of the show's highlights. The &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; is sure to stick in your head, also featuring a cameo by Mya (yes, the pop singer). In the duration of her stay at the Cook County Jail, Roxie manages to win the heart of lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who decides to help her win the case and get out of jail. Rivals soon erupt between Velma, who once hold the spotlight and newcomer Roxie. Eventually, everyone is pleased and you end up wondering whether you are or not. As I said earlier, this is a dark comedy and it is made to question you. If you feel kind of confused at the end, whether you should feel happy or angry at them, it is perfectly fine. This comedy makes you think. It questions our judicial system and our society's obsession with Murders and Court Cases. If you enjoyed &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; check out &quot;Chicago&quot;--it will surely beat them all!
A1C8YPTUO925IH	1	1	I've used this item for several months. No problems yet. The cap does seem to be a bit loose. Never did snap on tight! I think it will fall off and get lost soon. Considering the price, It's a still a deal.
A1C8YPTUO925IH	0	0	I too purchased one of these fine looking levels. I used it only a few times since I'm not a professional tradesman! My bubbles have also grown increasingly longer. One vial only has a few drops of liquid left in it. There is no sign of leakage! The liquid is just gone.As the other reviewer states, replacement vials are impossible to find!SHAME ON YOU STANLY TOOLS!You might get 2 years out of it before the vials start to dry up but that will be about it!
A1C8YPTUO925IH	1	1	This is a great motherboard! Assembled everything and it booted right up on first try! Just buy it!AI Boost is sooooooo easy to use. Makes overclocking really easy! Change the multiplier, The cpu voltage, the memory voltage while booted up! It also has an auto mode to overclock the cpu up to 10% automatically! Many options in the BIOS to overclock it manually if you know what you are doing there!Comes with enough cables to hook up 6 SATA drives. Up to 3 Gb per second. It's fast. Also supports Phenom CPU's.My system 5000 x2 Black edition cpu, 4 GB Kingston hyperx sli ready memory, Freezer pro cpu fan, EVGA 8800GT video card and 2 Seagate 500 GB SATA hard drives.
A1C8YPTUO925IH	1	0	Over the years I have used J B Weld for everything from holding an aluminum lawn mower engine block together to keeping replacement handles tight on tools to repairing the steering wheels on old tractors. Plus hundreds of other things.I have only found a couple things it would not stick to and they were some kind of plastics.I just love the stuff! I'm sure you will too.
A1C92FV1I5FM4T	1	1	Replaced a ten year old Microwave with this Sharpe R-320. Love the sensor technology that is built in to this unit, very happy with this purchase.
A1C92FV1I5FM4T	0	1	Faux leather won't take a shine, but they are comfortable just for factory work or times you want to dress down.
A1C92FV1I5FM4T	1	1	A sleep helper, great for times when you want to listen to the radio or mp3 player to help you fall asleep while not disturbing others.
A1C92FV1I5FM4T	0	1	Not a fan of this type of movie. Dealing with super natural issues or themes, just couldn't get into it.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	If you have the urge to write, or paint, or sculpt, or do any of the dozens of other creative things creative people do, but just can't seem to find the time, meet your new best friend. Steven Pressfield will talk you down from the ledge, out of the window, away from the sharp knife. If you are a creative person, whatever form that creativity may take, you need this book.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	One of my students likes to use this in preference to a desoldering pump. He says it does the job quite well, and I believe him; his joins are very tidy and neat, which means he's used it to successfully clean up after his boo-boos.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	I recommend this book almost as strongly as I do Larry Brooks' &#34;Story Engineering.&#34; That one's a little more concrete than this in terms of plot structure, but this one has some very very good advice as well. Get yourself a copy. It will be a welcome resident of your bookcase for several years.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	0	It's not longer available. That's too bad, because I will use this until it's ragged, and then see if I can find something that resembles it.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	Bag is well-made, with well-finished seams and a strong join of handles to bag. Downside: the straps don't encircle the bag, and they aren't long enough (at least when bag-carrier is plumped up by winter coat) to carry as a shoulder bag. Not sure they'd be long enough to carry on shoulder in summer without getting pit juice all over the bag.Beyond that: quite strong, roomy. The interior pocked is divided in half, which makes it less helpful than it might be. Still, a fine, useful bag.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	Not your average Giant Clumsy Guitar Stand, but it works. The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support. If you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs, or even fairly large cats, a larger stand might be a better choice. If your household is quiet, this is very much a good bargain.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	There are two types of books for writers: the ones which teach the writer how to create articles and stories writing teachers like, and the ones which get the writer to actual sales to markets which pay in money, not copies. This book is one of the latter. If memory serves me I actually got this as a freebie for my Kindle, and almost drowned in it, taking obsessive notes and rereading it constantly. Not sorry I did that; I now feel that Mr. Tobias has given me a very strong grasp on the two subjects, and for the first time showed me how the choice of one's theme in writing a book determines the strategy used to write it. Highly recommended.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	0	The pillowcase is well-made, fits nicely, and the fabric far exceeds the lightweight stuff found in most pillowcases. I'm very pleased, and will seek out Snoozer products next time I have a need for these linens.Update: the company also sells a pricey J-shaped pillow which this case fits; I erroneously believed it was a plain regular no-frills pillow case, just body-pillow sized. I found, however, that the case shapes my two-year-old body pillow into its own J. So save your money on the pillow and simply buy the case.I've also been pleased by other aspects of its performance: does not shrink or get thin with washing.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	In my home these forceps are used in two ways: electronics, which I can't speak to as it's not my use of them, and to hold the guitar strings during string changes. In this latter use, they are superb: just heavy enough to really do the job. They've also proven quite useful for getting things-that-I-shouldn't-have-dropped out of tight places.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	0	0	This product does exactly what it says it will: it applies a layer of sticky upon which it is possible to reposition items.It also holds quite well.Those are the upsides: does what it says it will, and does it rather well.The downsides: once you have applied this product to something it is nearly impossible to remove it. Soap and water, rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover: it laughs at all of them. You can scrape it off surfaces, but that's about the only way to get rid of it; WD-40 works too but it requires a lot of product.And overspray is quite difficult to avoid, as it does not come with a tube applicator.Classroom use, particularly by younger children, is a nightmare to contemplate. Why this product is labeled a "toy" is beyond me.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	Even outstanding writing books rarely contain more than one good idea. This book's, that you must appeal to your reader emotionally, is so broadly applicable that Swain patiently takes the reader through its every use. He creates his own examples to illustrate his points, which means you won't be out of luck if you haven't read the book cited, or don't remember it clearly. The workings of reader engagement are clearly and unambiguously presented.Titles which other writers have inflated into entire books are only chapters in "Selling Writer." This doesn't mean it's a tome; it clocks in at 316 pages."Techniques of the Selling Writer" is one of the nine books on writing I dedicate bookshelf space to, after reading a hundred fifty-three of them.It's hard for me to say how impactful "Techniques" has been on my own writing. It revolutionized my efforts, refocusing me on reader involvement.I can say this: shortly after completing the book, I applied what I'd learned to a short story I'd written earlier, and three days before I wrote this review, I got word that the story will be published. It's my first sale, so I'm inclined to think that this book is the real goods.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	We bought this to use on an electronics workbench; &#34;real&#34; magnetic boards for such start at about three times this price. The unit did exactly what we asked it to: collected screws and other parts. Don't put it down because it's a toy; you can save yourself and your electronics hobbyist a ton of money by buying and using this.

A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	0	Those things you know you have to fix in your Ms, but you haven't figured out how to do that? One or two might not kill your ms. but there are never only one or two. Lukeman, a longtime agent, shows how to fix them, even the very tough ones like pacing. Excellent book, and may spare the writer a case of sender's remorse. (You know, you hit &#34;Send,&#34; and then you read your e-mail just once more, and you see all those things you really should have caught before you hit send: sender's remorse.)
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	In our house, its job is grinding nuts and seeds. At that, it excels. It's not hard to clean; its only drawback seems to be that the cord does not retract all the way, leaving about 6&#34; protruding.
A1C92SAQFUBJSZ	1	1	No complaints. Easy on the hands, well-padded grip, and the working surfaces are sharp and well-tooled. A great tool for the price.
A1C92V82X59HF7	0	1	I have chronic back/neck problems so I thought I'd give this a try for my commute. The price is GREAT, but how do you anchor this to your seat? It comes with only 4 flimsy ties that are just a few inches long, and I have nowhere to tie it! I finally did the "seat" ones to the Seat belt. I have no where to tie the upper ones. I purchased this because it showed I could put it OVER the headrest for my neck, but because there's no where on that part to tie it down ANYWHERE, I ended up having to put it in between the seat and headrest to hold it in place. Problem is every time I sit down, it slides out, and I end up having to fix it almost every day! Velcro or longer, sturdier strap are in order, especially at the top that SHOULD go over the headrest. The beads are strung with what looks like a thick fishing line, and because it keeps shifting around so much, not sure how long it's going to hold up. Not thrilled with it, but was inexpensive enough that it's not worth it to ship it back.
A1C92V82X59HF7	1	1	I decided to purchase this item despite the negative reviews. I was a bit apprehensive because the price was about $10-$15 higher than others I found.I wear 8 diamond earrings in my ears and rarely take them out so they get really, really, REALLY gunked up with hairspray, etc. Normally I use one of those jewelry cleaners that the jeweler gives you, and even after soaking for an hour, I still have to scrub to get them clean and it still doesn't do a thorough job.I used this unit with Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner ConcentrateGem & Jewelry Cleaner Concentrate (8 Oz)and even though I only used the 480 second setting just once, ALL the gunk was gone! I haven't seen my earrings this shiny/sparkly since I purchased them.I was a little nervous to use on my Tanzanite rings and bracelets since I've heard that the stone is a bit brittle, but had NO issues...Just used less time to clean and they still came out great!Also used on a pair of glasses that my boyfriend wears daily working as an electrician, and it worked well on those as well.The unit was much better made than expected after reading the reviews. I'm very pleased with the purchase and recommend it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I wish they had a basket with smaller holes for stud earrings. If you put the studs in the very center they're ok, but if they shift out of the very center they will "escape" out the larger holes and can get lost if you don't pay attention. Providing a smaller basket for stud earrings and smaller pieces would be a great idea.
A1C92V82X59HF7	0	1	We live in an old, VERY drafty house and I get cold easily. Bought this to use on my side of the bed in the winter, and unfortunately, it only lasted just over One season...Yes, there was a smell the first couple of times you use it, but it goes away. It puts out a lot of heat, it's light, and I wasn't able to see much of a difference on our electric bill, even with daily use for several months. This year I pulled it out to use and it worked great until last night. Turned it on and it started sparking and looked like it was going to catch on fire. Conveniently enough for Delonghi, it's four months past the warranty date.I really liked that the heater was silent, worked good enough to heat our entire bedroom so we didn't have to heat the rest of the house, and heated fast enough to just warm my cold toes. I'm really bummed now and will now have to look for an alternative option. Obviously I won't be buying another one of these. I expected it to last at least another year or so.
A1C92V82X59HF7	0	0	UPDATE - I'm downgrading this to two stars...The beads I received are NOT the colors listed! I just went through the entire lot and probably only 3 out of the 25 are as listed...the others are off-colors that I wouldn't have ordered had I know that's what I would be getting in the first place...some people may not know any better but I know my crystal colors. :(I received my order quickly, and I do agree they are not 100% genuine swarovski...you can tell by the color difference, but I'm ok with that based on the price I paid. (You do get what you pay for!)...However, one of the pictures on this item shows each bag labeled by color...I received my order and all the beads were nicely separated but they were not labeled as the seller's picture describes. Again, I'm ok with looking up the colors myself for my organizing containers I use, but don't state that you will have them labeled if you have no intention of doing so. Overall, I would still probably purchase them again.
A1C92V82X59HF7	0	0	I wish I would have read the reviews before I wasted $5.50 for ONE mailer...I thought it was for a box of them. Amazon, I've ordered from you the day you opened your online store and you should be ashamed of yourselves!!! It'll cost me more to send the darn thing back so apparently I'm stuck. VERY unhappy...I wanted to have a box of these mailers to send items much needed to my sponsored child in Zambia, guess I'll have to go buy them elsewhere. :(
A1C9DOUDP2CGVH	1	1	The food is realistic and my son has a lot of fun cooking things up, the little wooden bins are great for storing the food and are very durable. The only thing to watch out for is that some of the fruit is made from solid wood and if thrown could be dangerous to anyone in its path. Overall great quality product my son has enjoyed playing with this much more then the plastic food.
A1C9DOUDP2CGVH	1	1	I was searching for a small play stove set for my son who just turned 3 and is very into pretend play. This stove was perfect, it's realistic, great quality, durable and best of all my son loves it. If you are looking to save space and avoid getting one of those giant pretend kitchens I'd recommend this product.
A1C9DOUDP2CGVH	1	1	Folder is great size and has worked well for storing all my son's art work that I have trouble throwing away :)
A1C9DOUDP2CGVH	1	1	I purchased this cooking set along with the Alex Stove and my son loves it, all the items are very realistic and of good quality. He has enjoyed cooking many of meals with this set.
A1C9KXZJ9BP7ZH	1	1	I should have given this 3 stars, but made a mistake and couldn't change it! Don't need the book - the CDs are great (at least #3 is for sure and #2 is growing on us). The book, while cute and funny, was purchased after we bought Beethoven's Wig #3, and it is OK. #3, however, is absolutely a must-have - it is hilarious and the music is beautifully done. My kids love the instrumental pieces as much as the sing-along versions. We then bought #1 (which we have not heard - we gave it as a gift) and #2, which is good but not from the start like #3.
A1C9KXZJ9BP7ZH	1	1	I have not actually listened to this one - we gave it as gift and have not heard from them either. But we started with Beethoven's Wig 3 which is OUTSTANDING! My kids love it, as do all the "kid" passengers who have ever heard it. We also have #2, which initially didn't seem as good as #3, but with more listening, we are enjoying it more too. #3 was a winner from the very first song. The lyrics are hilarious and the music is beautiful - and my kids love the instrumental pieces as much as the sing-along versions.
A1C9NVZ47VVHTK	1	1	A genuinely fascinating collection of interviews with some of the most important jazz figures of the 1950s-60s. (It's worth the purchase price just for the goofy, entertaining exchange with Dexter Gordon which opens the book.) Not only do you get an unusually intimate sense of what some of these brilliant musicians were/are actually like in &quot;real life,&quot; but the book is particularly interesting--and frank--about the subject of race, in the jazz world and beyond. If you love jazz, don't miss this book.
A1C9NVZ47VVHTK	1	0	When I bought this book, I had fairly low expectations. I assumed it would be a lightweight beach book--and hey, nothing wrong with that! But, to my surprise, it's well-written, unique, and well worth purchasing in hardcover. It may look fluffy on the outside, but Jennifer Weiner has some interesting and thought-provoking things to say. How pleasant to come across a writer who actually deserves the hype she's getting! I'm definitely be looking forward to reading her next book.
A1C9NVZ47VVHTK	0	0	I really wanted to like this book. I was expecting an entertaining, fast-moving thriller, but although it started off pretty well, I found it very disappointing. The book doesn't even pretend to be anything other than a screenplay treatment--I kept looking for the &quot;CUT TO&quot; indications between each of the constantly changing scenes. The problem is, it is going to be an extremely derivative and not terribly interesting action movie. It reads like a typical paint-by-number written-by-committee movie, full of one-dimensional characters and utterly predictable twists and turns. I actually like action movies, but about halfway through, I got so bored that I had trouble finishing the book. One thing I've always wondered--if a writer is going to go to the trouble of presenting multiple points-of-view (there were at least twenty in this book; I lost track), shouldn't he or she at least make a small attempt to give the characters different voices? I'm really sorry I didn't wait until this one shows up on HBO or something.
A1C9OEKNHRABRT	0	1	This movie was so bad it was funny. There were so many inconsistenys. Like the guy who dies in one scene and reappears in the gym later. The fact that the bad guy makes a half billion, but can't afford to hire minimum wage security guards. The pointless nudity. The way all the villians laugh at ever thing... What the Heck is do dang funny? The main guy is like some kind of chessy Costas Manalo impresonator who does kung fu. Did the producers of this movie even watch the UFC. Shamrack was the one guy in the whole film to keep his hands up during a fight scene. Not only that but they had some major BS fight scenes in this movie. Shamrock and Rockford were the only ones with any idea about grappling. (No wonder they were champs). Going back to the half billion. I don't even thing the UFC makes that much. How are we to believe he could clear that? Well that Aside it was really cool to see Shamrock in a movie. I found he mannarisms humorus at times. The scene in which he and Rockford enter a formal ball in matching suits then begin to circle around giving each other the evil eye until Shamrock just shurgs as if to say "what?" was hilarious. The one punch finisher was funny too, considering ever body lifts their hands after he knocks them out. The blind folded death match was cool, cheesy and humorous. Since it proved how ineffective movie fighting is. Basically Shamrock stodd there with his hands up while the guy kicked his arms... Throw a punch for cripes sake! Still I'm HUGE(!) Shamrock fan, and I watched this movie solely for him. I respect the chops.
A1C9OEKNHRABRT	1	1	Well let me start off by saying I knew most of what was in this book from experience. However if you don't want to find out the hard ways (a series of brutal atacks from &quot;bully&quot; types), then you should invest in this book. Let me explain what you will get. The first part of the book is dedicated to explaining what a &quot;Bully&quot; type personality, and woofing really is. The &quot;Interview&quot; as it is called is peyton word for the intial verbal bashing the Bully type gives you before an attack. Quinn also explains that the &quot;interview&quot; is the process the bully takes to select a victim. Quinn goes indepth by explaining in a straight forward amnner that Bullies aren't looking for what your thinking, but instead looking for a sense of power over another person. Made since to me. It also explained why every smuck in North Carolina had to waste my valueable time picking a fight with me, and why when I made it clear they were going to have to put some work into beating me down then they retreated. Quinn expands on thes thoughts with the effectiveness of senario based training. Quinn explains how senario based training can indoctrinate an indivual in as little as a weeks time. At some points, unfortunaly, it sounds like he is just advertiseing for RMCAT, or it is some kind of manifesto. Still the book was of great value since it explained in frank english the truth about fighting. Most of the self defense books I hve seen only showed me techniques, some were more effective techniques than other. However, in stressfull situations the techniques did me no good. This book explained to me what I actually needed to make those techniques effective. I need to control myself. The battle is decided before the first two sword ever cross.
A1C9OEKNHRABRT	1	1	I have to say this book is quite awsome, not just from a Amatuer Wrestling stand point, but Also from a self defense stand point. Oddly in MMA circles we devote huge amounts of time into studying Freestyle takedowns. We often over look the value of Basic Greco tactics. I found the adive on where to grab your oppoent for control to be worth the price of the book. Combine what you read in this book with some Boxing, low kicks, and a few submissions you will have a formatible repitore. Still I have to say this is a book, not a video. If you can't put whats going on together in your mind you might want to but the US coaches syllsbus.
A1C9OEKNHRABRT	1	1	I know I have a corny title, but the proof is honestly shown in what took place the months after following the advice in this book. I read this book and found it's advice interesting and honest. I used to work in a gym as a janitor. I observed that the train who had great physques would teach their clients &quot;comtempary&quot; high reps low set shemes. They themselves would train with lower rep high sets. After observing how the gym operated I found that people performing the &quot;Powerlifter&quot; shemed work out were less sore, and in better shape. I followed the advice in the book. It was simple enough, and the routine was much easyier to follow than most of what I had seen in the gym. The best part was the fact that I didn't need the gym, just a barbell, and someweight. I quit the gym, and continued to workout at my local dojo. The highlight of my training was the fact that since all of my muscles were trained to work in unison I was a much better Martial Artist. I managed to defeat my Sensi in a no holds barred street match in the first round. The seconfd round he deafted me. All In all I recommend this book for any purpose in your routine, but only if you want results.
A1C9P56DE8FPNC	0	0	The good: The "Mr E" storyline is very interesting, and the bad guys are some of the creepier looking in the Scooby world - good monsters with good (usually) motives.The bad: The mysteries in this series play second fiddle to the absolutely horrid romance plots - the monsters and the clues seem almost like an afterthought thrown in to keep it from being a soap opera with a talking dog. Freddie, one of the smartest characters in the original series, is a bumbling idiot with no intuition whatsoever. Velma, also one of the smarter series characters, is a whiny, completely unlikeable teenage girl who is possessive, clingy, wanting to change the guy she supposedly likes, who is jealous of a DOG... In fact, she personally makes the show barely, it at all, watchable. Its a train wreck.
A1C9P56DE8FPNC	1	1	I brewed tea in this thermos at about 8pm and fell asleep on it just a bit later. When I woke up, I accidentally kicked it off of the drink stand and it didn't spill a drop. Opened it up at around 3PM intending to reheat, and it was still warm! Great thermos.
A1C9P56DE8FPNC	1	1	If you judge this as a completely separate show from the old Scooby Doo, you might enjoy this. The animation has moments of greatness. Some episodes are quite creepy, with great horror movie references. The episodes are funny and sarcastic, with dark humor that is quite enjoyable and a running plot that keeps you interested. The villains occasionally have real, dangerous weapons. And, however dubious the plots are, they blend "real" monsters with fake monsters quite well.If you approach this season hoping for the original Scooby Doo, you'll be disappointed. The side plots cut out some parts of the original cartoon that were so fun, like the chase scenes. The mysteries get solved, but unlike the original, you can't really follow along - in some episodes, especially in the first season, the clues point straight to the bad guy, in most of this season, there are no clues whatsoever. In the end, they sort of tell you what happened, but you'll rarely be able to guess.However, if you take the show for what it is, and not what the original was, you'll probably like it!
A1CA1U4YZTBA2G	0	0	Don't get this card if you are buying it for its "range" capabilities. I paired this with it's rangemax router and it wouldnt even pick up the network. Both my centrino chipset AND ancient d-link 802.11b usb adapter pick up that same network.The router is decent but I am VERY disappointed with the failure to live up the claims on the box. 3.5 year old hardware shouldnt be able to beat the paired "rangemax" combo.The router is decent. Although the router gets "weak" signal according to the d-link utility, it is very quick with internet whereas other networks with the same signal strength are not as good. I can't really recommend a good range-specific combo for high data rates, I can just tell you to stay away from this.PS I tried a linksys range extender and it couldn't pick the network up either. I would skip that solution too.
A1CA1U4YZTBA2G	0	0	I just got the 2006 version 6 months ago, and just purchased a new Vista computer. They sent this BS email a few months back saying "2006 won't work with Vista". Basically I had no choice but to upgrade after error after error popped up in Vista (especially when using plugins).Furthermore, there isn't even an "upgrade". Why must I buy a full version EVERY time I want a new version. Even MS lets you properly upgrade Windows, and there are MANY more changes in an OS than in a 1-yr old piece of acctg. software. Even the toolbar is chock-full of advertisements for other products. I feel like I'm using a trial version even though I just paid $200 for this thing.Not even the '07 interface has changed. I feel ripped off and stuck in a corner. MS: "Please produce a decent piece of acctg. software so I can ditch QB!"
A1CA1U4YZTBA2G	0	1	I purchased this item when the C2D MacBooks came out (maybe a week after) and have been using it since. I thought it was doing the job it implied (keeping my laptop in pristine condition), but alas, it did not. As a previous poster mentioned, this thing causes scratching of its own. It may be dust trapped inside, or just rubbing, but there are noticeable scratches all over the top of my MacBook. The main reason for this is because this product creates a minute gap between the laptop and the top piece of the Speck shield. When you apply pressure, that gap is eliminated and that slight bending of the Speck cover is where I suspect the friction against the top cover is coming from.This cover should be engineered with a cloth or rubber-like material on the inside as to prevent rubbing. It is appalling that Speck let this slip through QA. It looks like they just wanted to get it to market without really testing it. Next time around, I'm going for another brand regardless if they 'fix' this product. Thanks Speck for charging me $50 for a cheap piece of plastic that did exactly what it was intended to prevent. My notebook looks like a** now.I'm torn on a recommendation either way. Yes, this has minimized damage, but it still damaged my laptop. If there are any alternatives, I'd look at them first.
A1CA1U4YZTBA2G	1	1	This mouse is awesome. I use it with my desktop because I enjoy the smaller size as I am able to grasp it with my fingertips for more control.Pros: Easy to control, scroll wheel can be put into a friction-less mode to where it just spins freely, attractive.Cons: Mediocre reception, possibly wifi interference?, no bluetooth model available, clunky windows software, however the OSX version isn't too badBottom line is if you want a stylish mouse that is easy to use and doesn't have 10,000 useless buttons, this is the one.
A1CA73IJZ57U6S	1	1	This is a good moderately-priced receiver. I'm really picky about electronics, so this review is for other folks who are also very picky.Good: lots of power, auto speaker configuration, video switching (with some limitations), ability to map different digital inputs to various video inputs, pure audio mode, intelligent input informationAnnoyances: The on-screen display is kind of retro (it's text-based and very simple). Most of the functionality is there, although I'd like to see more bands and a graphical display of the EQ settings. The remote is pretty good, but it needs more macros, and it would be nice if picking a remote mode (DVD, V1, etc) would also automatically switch the video input mode. Important note: there is no on-screen display for HDMI out, and there is no volume display on the component out when a component input is switched in, but the OSD does work with component out. This unit uses relays to switch the surround and surround back channels on and off. There is some kind of timeout on the back channels in which they automatically turn off (click!) when there's no back-channel signal. When a movie you are watching suddenly has a back-channel signal, they turn back on (click!). It's kind of annoying, but the timeout is pretty long (maybe 15 minutes?). Finally, there is no way to update to new HDMI versions or new Audio encodings, but what moderately-priced receiver has that?
A1CA73IJZ57U6S	1	1	Bowen Simmons has provided a complete and accurate review of this. I just wanted to add a couple of things. First my setup: I have an Onkyo SR-803 7.1 home theatre receiver and a 5th generation iPod. I'm very picky about sound quality. I encode my music in a high VBR, and I don't buy any tracks from iTunes. I use full-range Infinity speakers for my front sound stage and prefer CD-quality sound for stereo listening. So, I've avoided buying any ipod-to-stereo interface because I was concerned about audio quality.That being said, I decided to try this out. What swayed me was having an on-screen menu to browse music on my TV. This is the "built-in" display that Simmons talks about. His review of this mode is accurate, although I believe the limitations he mentions about photos and videos not being on the built-in display are actually a limitation of the iPod software and not this (or any) dock. (I think the video-out solution on the iPod is still half-baked right now.) Perhaps software upgrades will fix this, but knowing Apple, we'll all have to give them more money for a future iPod version.Onto sound quality. When I first plugged this in, I was disappointed. The sound was flat, and I had to turn the stereo up a lot to hear the music. Then I decided to wander into the SR-803's setup menus to see if there was something wrong. (The 803 is a great receiver, btw, despite having a text-based on-screen display that reminds me of 80's. See my review of the 804, the newer version.) Anyway, the 803 has a pre-amp adjustment that you can apply to each audio input. They call it "Intellisound" or something like that, but what it does is allow you to adjust for variations in line level inputs. I increased the ipod input up 3 dB, and the sound improved dramatically. So, you may want to check your receiver for this option.I also tested the RI connection on the dock. It works great! The 803 has a great remote, with a joystick-like control in the middle. It provided much more intuitive control over the built-in menu than this dock's remote.Finally, video output. Yes, composite output is old technology and the built-in menu is reminiscent of the 80's. But it does get you to your music without having to look at the little ipod screen. You can change the background color of the menu, which helps a little, but also resulted a lot of chroma noise on the letters. Photos looked fine, and I didn't try video. I'm not sure this dock is all that useful for video/photos, but for music, it does the job.What would make this dock perfect?* A digital audio connection from the iPod to the stereo. Apparently the 5th-generation iPods support a digital output through the dock connector. I haven't yet been able to find out what that means exactly, whether it's just a byte stream of the encoded file (MP3, AAC, etc) or some other digital audio standard. Regardless, I'd really prefer that my amp do the D-to-A processing.* Better on-screen display. There are two solutions: either the iPod should just output its display, or the dock should try to mimic it. The Alpine IDA-X001 car stereo takes the second approach. It tries to mimic the menu structure, album art, marquee-style song titles, etc.* S-Video or better video output.
A1CA73IJZ57U6S	1	0	Just like the pros in coffee shops use, this thing is awesome. Fill it with a half pint of whipping cream and some vanilla syrup and charge it with the N2O canister.You'll never buy whipped cream in a can again.You can buy the N2O canisters in bulk here, too.
A1CAIHVC3JHJ60	0	1	We have a golden retriever puppy and tried this when we were housebreaking him. We'd been using just a regular carpet stain cleaner but we were still smelling a urine odor, so after seeing the reviews for this I decided to give it a try since most people rated it so high. I went thru 3 bottles of it right away. The bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle, you have to pull up the lid and squirt it like you do with dish soap, so you really can't even just use a little bit. The directions say for best results to saturate the area to get down to the pad, so that's what I did. On some of the larger areas I used at least 1/4 of the bottle or more, and that caused a new problem, I was left with unsightly large spill type stains where there hadn't been a stain before, it just had an odor! Plus it didn't do a very good job of removing the odors, it may have helped tame them down, but there is still a urine odor, plus now I have these awful looking spill stains! I did try our usual carpet spray cleaner on these spill stains, but it didn't really help much. We're going to try steam cleaning next, and I definitely won't be buying anymore of this Kids & Pets Stain Remover!! It might work better for small dog's stains or fresh messes, but not for the old stains from our big dog.
A1CAIHVC3JHJ60	1	1	I just got my Perfect Chair 4 days ago, and I think the best description for it really is, PERFECT!! I'd been wanting one of these chairs for quite some time since I first saw one in the Better Back Store. Since they are pretty pricey I couldn't afford to get one for a while. I have major back problems, and have a really hard time finding chairs that are comfortable for me to sit in, but this chair is awesome!! I can sit it in it for fairly long periods, then just get up briefly and go right back to it. It's called a zero gravity chair, and is based on the designs by NASA. When this chair is fully reclined there is absolutely no weight or pressure felt in my low back! I love it!! I can comfortably sit in a recliner for the 1st time in over 10 yrs.! Maybe too comfortably, I always want to fall asleep after reclining for just a short period! Even with the chair only partially reclined it's comfortable, but you still feel some weight and pressure in the lumbar area. It's most comfortable when it's fully reclined. This chair also has an adjustable headrest which is good when you want to read or watch TV, and comes with a head and neck pillow that attaches to the chair, as well as an adjustable lumbar cushion to help you really get comfortable. I got my chair in the electric recline since I had problems bringing the chair back up without straining my back in the manual version. I'm 5'5" and I'm just a bit too short for my arms to reach the end of the arm rests to get to the release to bring the chair up. I tried it a good number of times in the store and never could get the hang of it, it just gave me a backache. My daughter is 5'9" and had no problems raising or lowering the manual recliner. It's an extra $300 for the electric recline upgrade, but I feel it's well worth it for someone who has back problems to begin with or may be on the short side, so that you don't strain your back trying to get comfortable, but if you can't afford the electric, I'm sure that with practice you could handle the manual recline. This chair is a major investment, but I feel that it's money well spent for others like me who can't easily find a comfortable chair. Maybe I should let Goldilocks know about these chairs, she'd probably find, as I have, that this chair is just right!
A1CAIHVC3JHJ60	0	0	I picked this book up because it was a guaranteed read. I figured that if the publisher was going to guarantee it, it must be good. They were wrong!! It was too long & too predictable. If you've read all or most of Robin Cook's novels as I have, you'll know what I mean. He has written too many novels where the managed care, insurance companies, or else the pharmaceutical companies are the bad guys. It's time for some new subject matter. I also had a hard time believing that a medical examiner could figure out that there was a serial killer on the loose after only doing two victim's autopsies and seeing that there was a pattern. I love the early Robin Cook novels, and everytime a new one comes out I buy it hoping that his writing has gotten back to like it used to be, and then I'm disappointed that it's not. Maybe in the future I need to just save my money.
A1CAIHVC3JHJ60	1	1	We have been using our PUR water filter with the flavor options for a little more than 2 months now, & our light just started blinking yellow, so we'll need to be changing the filter soon. We have EXTREMELY hard water here, & our city water often has a metallic or chlorine taste straight out of the tap. Prior to buying our PUR filter unit, we had a water dispenser which held the 6 gallon bottles of water. There's a lot of self serve places here in town where you can buy the reverse osmosis filtered water, but it's a pain since my husband always had to be the one to go fill the bottles since I can't lift that heavy jug. It's great now that we don't have to always be sure to have the water jugs filled, we can drink it straight from the tap without any more strange smells or tastes in our water!! I LOVE it!! I also love the flavor option, you can choose whether you want plain water or a shot of flavoring. Just don't overdo it! It tastes awful if you put too much in, just about one squirt for every 8 ounces of water. You can put a bit more or a bit less depending on your preference, just go easy! I don't know why several reviewers have said that the flavoring has no sweetener in it, it is sweetened with Sucralose which I think is Splenda. If you are not used to diet drinks or don't like diet drinks, then you probably won't like the flavor options since it is made with a diet sweetener, but I think it only has a very mild, hardly noticeable diet taste. My favorite flavor is the raspberry, & they just came out with lemon & grape flavors. They also have strawberry & peach. I really like the lemon too, but haven't found the grape yet. We were unsure if anything less than reverse osmosis could help our hard as a rock water, and also get rid of the odors & strange tastes, but this does a fantastic job!! We have made some ice with the filtered water, & although it's a bit cloudy, it's a huge improvement over the ice made with straight tap water. The only thing we don't really like is that when we use the filtered water to make iced tea, the tea tastes fine, but it looks cloudy. When I contacted the company to ask about this, they said that is a normal after effect from filtering the water. As I said, it doesn't affect the taste, but it just doesn't look as good as the tea we made with the bottled water, but that is our only complaint. So we may start buying water to make our iced tea, but that won't be too bad. We are still extremely happy that we finally gave the PUR filter a try. When we decided to try the PUR filtering system, we figured we had nothing to lose since the P&G company offers it's either a 30 or 60 day (I can't remember for sure)trial period during which you can return the unit if you're unhappy with it. So give it a try!! You have nothing to lose except for nasty tasting water!!
A1CAIHVC3JHJ60	1	1	I've been using my Oral B Vitality toothbrush for just over 6 months. I just had my 1st dental exam after using it, & it was the best ever! My dentist said my gums have never looked better, I didn't have to have ANY cleaning at all!! They just did my exam & polished my teeth. When I asked about the cleaning, the hygienist said I didn't need any cleaning because I did not have anything to be cleaned off! WOW! I love how the heads on the brush have bristles that stick out further on the outer row to get your gumline & between your teeth cleaned. It also has a 2 minute timer which doesn't reset itself if you stop for a few seconds to spit. I love this toothbrush & I hope Oral B never stops carrying it. I started using it after my previous brand's heads became harder & harder to find, & the price kept going up to almost $8/head! I called Oral B customer service & was referred to this brush. The rep said that this brush head only goes around & doesn't pulsate, so it's easier on your teeth. I had used a more expensive Oral B model for a few years, but it was just too hard on my teeth, & they became super sensitive. That's not the case with the brush. I love it! The Amazon price can't be beat either.
A1CAYKKGG0TXBR	1	1	Does a good job of holding paper towels so that you can tear off one towel at a time. Well made & attractive.(I got white)
A1CAYKKGG0TXBR	1	1	This is a great item to save water. Turn water off, soap up, turn water on, rinse! When you have to pay for water/sewer, this item really helps! Plus, it saves our valuable resources. This item works smoothly and shuts the water off completely-no dripping. Excellent purchase!
A1CAYKKGG0TXBR	0	0	These are no good for holding almost anything! Can't put anything but the lightest item on them. Would not buy again, or recommend.Useless!

I only take one or two capsules a day( with my evening meal). I also try to eat well, & walk for exercise. Like the capsules-don't like tablets at all.
A1CAZ2XV1IXNL1	1	1	The only other Stephen King book I have read is the shining and I didn't like it that much but I found The Green Mile at a used book sale and thought I would give it a shot and I am so glad I did. The last section had me completely sucked in. The book touches on so many human experiences and is so moving. I got all choked up reading the end. Just read it. You won't be dissapointed.
A1CAZ2XV1IXNL1	0	0	i read this book after my barn owner suggested it. she made it sound like a really interesting story and since I love the paranormal I decdided to give it a go. i was disappointed. first off I kinda think its stupid that he can see dead people but they don't talk, it kinda left me thinking ok whats the point. also the story just didn't flow for me at all. there was a bunch of random things that were thrown in there like the time machine, stupid facts about random characters, and the climaxes didn't fit in with the story.I was bored. i'm happy I only paid a dollar for the book.
A1CB64WO3VZ26H	0	0	This movie was terribly overrated. If you want to see people jumping from rooftop to rooftop, rent The Matrix. Explosive indeed, the effects were impressive, and if you're a fantasy devotee, you might be happy, but Crouching Tiger managed to take me to a place where I did not want to visit and where I did not want to stay. I was thankful when all the kicking stopped and I was able to go home.
A1CB64WO3VZ26H	1	1	One of the best historical works ever set to paper. This book should be in every American's library.
A1CB64WO3VZ26H	1	1	This little book is quite a find. While I'm not jewish, I was raised by a Catholic mother, so I think I can relate. These short poems will definitely bring a smile to your face.
A1CB64WO3VZ26H	0	1	If you frequently use this reference, you'll quickly find that Oxford has seen fit to cut out a great many words. If you want a quick reference without sacrificing comprehensiveness, I suggest you look elsewhere.
A1CB6GY5AH2IZE	1	1	Are republicans allowed to read science fiction?? Apparently so! Perhaps they sometimes stray from the Pat Robertson Book of The Month selection! I'm commenting, of course, on the reviews given by some of our "enlightened" readers. One of which decided to divulge the outcome. Talk about "intelligent design"!!! Oh, and surprise, many of them come from the Texas!! Let's talk about the book. It's good, period. Solid science, a la Baxter. The man does his homework. The pace was perfect. It allowed the reader to really get stuck in the "gumbo". The characters were an exaggerated version of the simian lifeforms we now have in the White House. Sure, one has to admit it's far from the truth..but how far?? Who can reject the fact that we (the USA) are much more alienated from the rest of the planet then we ever were in the past? The book is effective in its message: if we, as a planet, do not begin to devote our resources for the colonization of space,(and not heaven!!) our existence was/is meaningless.
A1CB6GY5AH2IZE	1	1	Why? Why are we the only organism (collectively) that evolves to ensure its own destruction? Perhaps that's the question McCarthy is asking. He shows us that individual drive is strong yet no match for the destruction humanity has brought upon itself. The tone needs to be dark, disturbing and ferociously melancholy..and so it is, in full, uncompromising force. Here is a powerful glimpse of our future, readers. The aftermath of an unnatural disaster...brought on by what?? The conquest for oil, water, religious righteousness?? Doesn't matter..we KNOW down deep, that our past and current legacy will make this bleakness a reality..and we deserve it. Period...we deserve it for failing to nurture this fragile cosmic accident called humanity....
A1CB6GY5AH2IZE	1	1	WHY THE FRAK DOESN"T THE REST OF THE PLANET LISTEN TO THIS FRAKKING BAND!!!! That's it...
A1CB6GY5AH2IZE	1	1	I'm filled with a tremendous sense of loss when I view this concert. The realization that these infinitely talented brothers will no longer sing together is like getting punched in the gut, leaving you breathless for an instant. To the critics who ridiculed their disco years, only to see disco reborn in the 90's, I offer my sincerest loathing. This video is priceless, worth every cent. We are witnessing the Brothers at their peak. I had forever wished they had recorded their "Live at last" performance, but was so pleasantly surprised to find this concert. Music connoisseurs will understand the significance of this performance and will surely experience a bitter sweet sentiment. Master song writers, producers and performers, the Brothers Gibb have made their mark. Buy this DVD, watch it with your children, and explain to them why that tear is running down your cheek.
A1CB6GY5AH2IZE	1	1	Hate to be melodramatic about this piece of art, but I felt, even if fleeting, the capacity of the human spirit. Well, that's what music is all about in the end, isn't it?? A welcoming island of tranquility in our current sea of hatred, violence, apathy and ignorance. Well done Collective Soul, well done young musicians, well done.... some hope for us after all???
A1CBDU6BH6UF71	1	1	On my first visits to Russia I would occasionally encounter an elderly person who would mention American lend - lease contributions to the defense of the USSR during their youth, and they would say thanks.As I read this amazing book, "Russia's Heroes, 1941-445" by Albert Axell the feelings of debt and gratitude to the selfless sacrifice of so many "Soviet" men, women and children deepened.From the defense of Brest to the "Night Witches" flying Polikarpov biplanes at Novorossisk, to the sniper wars and the memory families lost to the murderous Nazi horde - I will never forget to thank those who did not turn back and fought to their last breath for freedom, life and ultimate liberty at such a horrible cost.Thank YOU!
A1CBDU6BH6UF71	1	0	Absolutely fascinating! Yuri Modin is to be congratulated on his detailed memoir, and for his accounts of the Cambridge Five as they were called. The story tells of survival and a cold young engineer walking across frozen Lake Ladoga under Nazi mortar attacks, his being recruited by the NKVD, and posted to the Lubyanka as a translator of wartime intelligence reports from Soviet agents abroad. His mother taught the young Modin English. The KGB taught him his trade with on - the - job training during desperate times. Yuri Modin learned his trade well. His agents saved tens of thousands of Russian lives during the war, and perhaps helped us all avoid World War Three in the tense years afterward. British Secret Services failed miserably in recruiting avowed communists during the late 1930s. KGB took advantage and developed them into effective agents.The rich details in this amazing story should be in textbooks, and should written as a movie script, or better yet a multi - episode TV drama. I give "My Five Cambridge Friends" a solid 5 of 5 and "Best Of Genre" among memoirs of intelligence officers, regardless of nationality.Our agencies have to learn the lessons of this book.
A1CBDU6BH6UF71	1	1	Many of these planes still fly commercially today. To know Russia's aviation history and future, one needs to know these planes and the people who made them. Paul Duffy did know the people of Russian aviation quite well and introduces us to them. In my case, literally.An outstanding author, former pilot, and gentleman, the late Paul Duffy was Ireland's Air Transport Director, yet living in Moscow and working as an aviation consultant when we met in early 2001. I took a copy of this book to our first meeting in Washington D.C. That meeting began a friendship that lasted until his early passing several years later. We were in contact on various projects, and Paul had the respect of many an industrial leader as well as the civil aeronautics authorities in post - Soviet Russia.Paul Duffy is sorely missed by his family and many friends. His book tells it like it was, and in many ways still is.-Randall StephensTEJAVIA
A1CBRYNAVFXEIH	1	1	To be privileged to be a bird on a wire at a Tommy Flanagan concert is something to remember. This live recording from New York's Birdland is almost as good, recorded as it is on his 67th birthday with a most appreciative audience on hand. Tommy Flanagan is physically perched by the keyboard, gentle yet powerful, a great jazz sight. A robin is a bird and so is an eagle, gentle yet powerful - powerful yet gentle. This set opens with a tuneful melody by a fellow Motor City bird, Thad Jones, and turns and twists into a wonderful example of this Bird in flight. With Lewis Nash and Peter Washington in tuneful, telephatic tandem this becomes a complete collection of works, nodding also towards Tom MacIntosh and the Birks Bird, and the Mockingbird that is Ellington. In the great scheme of things Tommy Flanagan is occasionally overlooked his place in the pecking order of superlative jazz piano stylists, but here's the remedy - buy this album and appreciate his genius. It is a grand and challenging work, and many Happy Returns to the jazzbird that is Tommy Flanagan.
A1CBRYNAVFXEIH	1	1	Even allowing for the semi-literate opinion floating out there, those of us who tickle the ivories would say that Dave McKenna has yet to commit to vinyl/CD an album that is less than compelling. To label Monsieur McKenna a one-man-band is to miss the point... for he is no one trick pony. Nuance, Emotion and Shade are just as much his stock in trade as that Stomping Left Hand. This collection goes to prove that a cohesive concerto-like whole can be made of such disparite tunes which only share in common their titles/themes. Invidious to attempt to pick out one track, although the McKenna originals 'Shadowland' and 'Dream 'n' Blue' are outstanding. This is an imaginative and refreshing set, typical of the touch of Dave McKenna. All familiar tunes, yes, but touched by The Master's Hand.
A1CBRYNAVFXEIH	1	1	C'est spot on, as it were. As a matter of fact, C'est si bon. Having heard the Terrasson Trio in St. Gilles Croix de Villes this year, giving an exceptional performance featuring many of these chansons, I am bound to say Beautiful Music.
A1CBRYNAVFXEIH	0	1	You'll be in for a surprise with this one. And I don't just mean the absence of the customary polemic from the mind of Maestro Mehldau spread across the liner notes. To these ears Brad Mehldau is a piano genius who has produced some of the outstanding jazz piano efforts of recent years. But don't expect another singing, sad and lilting piano trio effort here or perhaps one of his ruminative solo offerings. 'Largo' is a serious departure from his usual fare. The musicians on this CD are all out of the top drawer, no question about that, it's just that they are all over the place. Think latter-day Waits, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink drama, meets a Piano Prepared by a Radiohead. That kind of thing. Nice jacket by the way.
A1CBTYDKIVPYD4	1	0	The thing I like most about this movie is the pacing. Just like the lead character it takes it own time and I would imagine that they couldn't even make a movie like this today, nobody would allow the slow pacing, they would either fill it up with music, or gags, or quick cutting. Peter Sellers was simply brilliant. The fact that you can believe this character at all is a tribute to the writing and the directing. Simply a beautifully made movie
A1CBTYDKIVPYD4	1	1	This was my kind of comedy. It's funny and smart and out of the mainstream. Some comedies pound you over the head and others ask you to discover them as you are watching. I put this in the latter group. Albert Brooks has such an individual approach that it's too bad that some people seem to miss the point. But to me his movies get even better with repeated viewings and I think that is always a great sign.
A1CBZ42FE3CTP8	1	1	This artfully produced show lasted, sadly, just one season. I had the feeling that there was a lot more storyline and character development to expolore. As opposed to "Lost", a vastly overated show that crumbled under its own weighty peregrinations into unresolved sublots and some uninteresting characters (conveniently dropped out of sight with no explanation), "Invasion" manages to take the old chestnut of intrusive aliens and embed it in a larger framework ranging from clandestined military operations, power mongering, romance, and creepyness that resonates well within the Florida everglades. None of the stars have marquee recognition, but they are fantastic actors who sustain a plot which is tense with both personal issues and world crashing drama. To me, "Lost" was about 6 years too long, and "Invasion" was several seasons too short.
A1CBZ42FE3CTP8	0	0	I had ordered this some time ago and was just getting around to viewing it when I discovered that the discs were all corrupted. Can't even play them. Obviously a badly made copy. Do not purchase from this dealer. They sell trash.
A1CC9N7YP3ALC2	0	0	The title of this product is misleading, as it does not drain. Water accumulates in the bottom of it, causing the base to rust if it is used as a drainer.
A1CC9N7YP3ALC2	1	0	I use this product to heat water for my Chemex coffee maker, because all surfaces that come in contact with the hot liquid are made of stainless steel. If you are looking for a water heater that does not have plastic parts contacting the water, this is a good choice.
A1CC9N7YP3ALC2	1	1	The person who lives on the first floor of my apartment building owns two very loud dogs. The dogs pass the day sitting on a cat perch, in a window that is directly adjacent to the common entrance to our building. When the neighbor was not home, the dogs would go absolutely wild every time someone walked by the window, which was quite frequently.After speaking to my neighbor about it several times, I realized that he had no desire to rectify the situation. I therefore ordered the Pet-Agree as a last resort. I doubted that it would work, since the window is typically closed, but I felt it was worth trying.After being greeted by the normal barking, I held the unit a few inches from the window (probably about a foot from the dog) and pressed the button. Both dogs stopped barking and scurried off of the cat perch until I could no longer see them.It took several weeks of consistent use of the trainer in order to prevent the dogs from barking completely. During this time, I carried it with me whenever I went out, so that I could zap them immediately if they started barking. If I heard them barking from my apartment, I would walk downstairs with the device and zap the dogs either through the window or through the (closed) door. )You may have to press the button down for some time (30 seconds or more) for the dogs to respond.)The results have been fantastic and have exceeded my expectations by far. The dogs no longer bark when people walk by the window, and the building is so much quieter. I recommend this product to anyone wishing to rectify a similar situation.

A1CD6YFWIOEMTR	1	1	This book is a truly inspirational piece of work that I would recamend to EVERYONE. If every person who read this book were to pass it on to someone else in his/her life, the world would be a better place! This book teaches and reinforces the virtues of compassion, friendship, love and so many other of life's greatest lessons! Tuesdays with Morrie is a fast read that draws you into the depths of the relationship between Mitch and his beloved teacher; it also draws you into the depths of your own being and encourages soul searching that leaves you feeling more complete.
A1CD6YFWIOEMTR	0	0	While the author shows outstanding writing potential, style, and use of language, this book failed to showcase that in a way that will propel her to future fame. This book is incredibly difficult to follow and does not flow in a way that makes the reader want to try to follow along with where this story is going. I am not one to give up easily on a book, especially from a writer with such potential, but this book was too much even for me; after only 70 pages, I was ready to throw the book in trash. This seems to be an example of a great writer forcing a story about NOTHING. I hope to see her produce some notable pieces of literature in the future.
A1CD6YFWIOEMTR	0	1	This book just doesn't have the feel and the raw emotion that can be found from the typical Civil War/Lincoln novel. It also lacks any great historical background. While those fallacies could be made up for with great character building and liteary wit, those cannot be found in this novel of short stories. These fictional short stories will leave you with a longing for real literature. In fact, I found myself reading along and realizing NOTHING was happening.

A1CDOQV86QZNRT	1	1	This is the first CD I've gotten of Lisa Gerrard. She is clearly a masterful singer with a beautiful voice. Each and every time she opens her mouth to sing on this CD it is very apparent.I would almost describe this music as being holy: it has that kind of quality. There is an obvious purity, serenity, and beauty about it. But it's also very serious and grave, in a way, and therefore not always easy to listen to; but when you're in the right mood---when you're thoughtful, or serious, or sad perhaps---I imagine this could be the perfect music to hear.All in all, this CD has some very pleasant moments . . . but for me, somehow, somewhere, something is lacking just a little; I don't know what though.
A1CDOQV86QZNRT	0	0	I wouldn't give this any stars.This film is offensive, indecent, and harmful, and shows a disgraceful lack of knowledge and understanding.Anyone who has any respect for God or for goodness should avoid watching this film. The explicit scene where Satan is having sex with a man's wife and daughter at the same time, whom he has possessed to lie with him, is just one example of what you shouldn't allow yourself to suffer seeing.
A1CDWSJZY2RHG9	1	1	I enjoyed this watch so much that I bought a second one when the first one gave out. I like that I can check the time in the dark by pushing a button. my first one took alot of abuse so why would I change. I love this watch.

A1CDWSJZY2RHG9	1	1	I have used these knobs for over 10 years.. In closets and especially at the cabin for the numerous towels for all my company. I have 10 there right now and 10 in my current house.. The towels stay put and no dropping on the floor. Never use the adhesive only the screws and Molly's included. Yes the caps pop off but crazy glue works just fine. There is not another knob that does the job. Everywhere I move I find more uses for these knobs!

A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	Christoph von Dohnanyi as usual makes himself at home in modern music on this wonderful cd.In Stravinsky's Petruskha, he takes everything at just the right pace. The Russian Dance is especially playful, the next section seems to point out the connection between this piece and Messiaen's Turangalila Symphonie in an ever so subtle way. The first time Petrushka's theme is introduced, it sounds almost like the "flower theme." Horst Gobel makes a fine pianist for your money, and delivers an especially virtuosic performance. The dance of the Moor and the Ballerina is particularly haunting in quality. I just can't describe it. Dohnanyi navigates the tricky time signatures and striking bitonality in this section unflinchingly, with commendable acoustics to back him up, so there's not much to complain about. When Petrushka does enter, he sounds defiantly mock-heroic in just the right way. Now, there are two ways to interpret the finale. You can take it fast, and make Petrushka still sound mock-heroic, or at an extremely slow tempo, and make it sound terribly eerie. Dohnanyi's is clearly of the latter variety.I don't think I've ever heard so much organ in Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin as in this recording. I only have a single quibble with this interpretation. My quibble is that I think there should be more bass drum slap on the beat in the Thugs' theme's triplets. There are a couple of ways of interpreting the girl's clarinet solo in this piece. One could play it seductively as if the girl had jumped right into her role in this con-game, having obviously done it a million times before, or one could play it slower and more introspectively, with some hesitation. I think Dohnanyi is definitely of the latter variety, and this makes for a thought-provoking performance on all levels. From then on this performance is garden variety at worst on most levels. What is great about this performance is that when the Mandarin is climbing the stairs, unlike in most recordings you can actually HEAR HIS THEME, instead of it being covered up by all the panicking woodwinds. Dohnanyi is always at his best in broad and contrapuntal sections of pieces, and it really shows here. It only gets better in this recording.These great performances are definitely worth the price. I highly recommend them.
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	First of all, Schoenberg's works are an essential part of the orchestral repertoire, but they aren't for everybody. They can be dissonant, complex, and in the wrong performer's hands, listless and unrewarding. But in the right hands, his works can sparkle with an otherworldly aura rarely heard since, or spring with an unrelenting rhythmic energy.But I find that in a few of these performances such elements are missing more often than not, particularly in the oft-neglected Chamber Symphony No.2, Op.39. The first movement sounds rushed, and the second one is sloppy and unmusical. I recommend the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's performance or Jeffrey Tate's spectacular EMI traversal instead. In First Chamber Symphony he tries too hard to make the cellos and violas sound strained when he doesn't really have too. Again I would recommend the Orpheus disc or the one Tate's performance is coupled with, Simon Rattle's. They are both far better than this one.As for the Piano Concerto, the performance by Alfred Brendel is spectacular. The orchestral accompaniment is great, and his playing is idiomatic and exciting. His expressionistic style is different altogether compared to Uchida with Boulez, who takes a more classical approach, so it's well worth having both. They complement each other nicely.Overall worth hearing for Brendel, though its disc mate is simply business-as-usual.
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	As one who always loves to see classic performances come back into the light after years of neglect, it is my privilege to be able to start my new series with such a spectacular recording as this one, recently reissued by Amazon (of all people!) as a disc on-demand.Right from the opening chords you know you're for a treat. Sony's full sound treats this small wind ensemble with impeccable balance usually only found in specialty recordings. The Berlin Philharmonic, an orchestra which is generally associated with that musical monster von Karajan's mammoth recording cycles, here gives Mozart a delicacy of tone that is instantly recognizable.Zubin Mehta's versatile conducting is a dream. He balances the ensemble with remarkable precision; never a false entrance to be found! This is one of those performances where by the end we are left with little-to-no doubt what this is: Not a "modern," "period," or just plain ol' weird interpretation (Boulez fits that last one nicely), but exactly what the composer intended.If I have any quibbles they are tiny and quickly forgiven. For example, the slow section of the opening movement's clipped notes can seem choppy and indecisive. But that's about it.The notes are extensive and intelligent, discussing the quirky combination of instruments that this piece is for.The Bottom LineOnce this recording gains some some momentum, nothing can stop it from going straight to the top of your list. A valuable acquisition at any rate. Get it before it it disappears again into Sony's vaults!
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	Paul Hindemith, one of the foremost composers of the early twentieth century, has a style that can at first seem daunting: blaring brass, searing satire, and an extensive use of counterpoint can seem like a huge wall standing between you and understanding. But if there will never be a set that could give one a glimpse into this composer's mind directly, Decca has come up with the next best thing: World-class performances of the composer's most brilliants scores available at rock-bottom prices in a single package.There is not a single disappointment to be found on this entire set. Right from the powerful opening chord of the Konzertmusik Op.50 we know we are in for a real treat. While Tortelier may have bombast in the opening, Blomstedt knows how to keep the tension and rhythmic drive sustained for the entire duration of the first movement, something which seems to have escaped our friend from the BBC, and Albert too. One could consider the recordings for virtually every major work on these discs definitive; they have become the undisputed catalogue choices for almost every reviewer I've seen. The one odd-man-out is the Symphonia "Serena," a supposedly lighthearted work which ends up sounding rather pretentious in the end. But this has more to do with the music than the performers...The sound are is good as it could possibly be. The climaxes register without loosing any important lines in the process, which is no small feat for such densely contrapunctal music. And yet it is probably also the most important feature to have with said music.The documentation is insightful and well-written.But my point is quite clear: This a perfect start to any Hindemith collection, and definitely a worthwhile acquisition. Highly recommended.
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	In this repertoire distinctly in the German contrapuntal style, Arno Bornkamp has found what is truly his niche. Far more suited to it than the repertoire on his horrid cd of Saxophone Concertos, Bornkamp displays on this disc a distinct sensitivity to musical expression that makes it required listening for fans of the saxophone literature. Highly recommended.
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	I have known for a long time what a fantastic oboist Heinz Holliger is, having recorded concertos by Ligeti, Carter, and many others. But, as this album can testify, when put in charge of an orchestra playing late-romantic music is when he really shines! Charles Koechlin is a name many reading this may not be familiar with. Sadly left out of Alex Ross's music history lover's bible The Rest is Noise, I am only aware of his works due to the prominence of his Etudes for saxophone in the repertoire, and also thanks largely in part to the lovely attention that Holliger has paid to him through his series of discs on the H&auml;nssler label. But what a find! A composer who, quickly approaching the end of his life, managed to make Le Docteur Fabricius, Op. 202 one of the most enticing works of the 20th Century. After guiding the ensemble through the simple but brooding introduction and the carefully woven strands of counterpoint which make up the "revolt" sequence, Holliger leads them in the mammoth hymn to heal the war-torn world which constitutes the ending.The recorded sound only enhances the impact of this lovely disc. The orchestra is neither too distant nor in-your-face, perfect for the supple tones of this often serenely impressionistic music, especially the slow sections (such as La Nature, la vie, l'Espoir), which both act as a reminiscence of the accompanying work Vers la Voute etoilee, Op.129 and a taste of the sounds soon to come, from composers such as Olivier Messiaen.
A1CECYH8RQE901	1	1	Okay, let me first put this review into context: Faulkner's books have shaped my philosophy, and have changed the world. His works hold a prominent place in the American literary tradition whether drunk straight or filtered through the sieve of O'Connor, Kesey, Morrison, Lee or many others. Having said that, I must confess I honestly think many students in college read the first chapter of The Sound and the Fury, and think, "You know what? I'm through! That was enough madness for one day!" Of my all high school English teachers who had read it, only one of them was able to lay claim to any other Faulkner novel. They are brilliant teachers, but simply did not like The Sound and the Fury (which all of them had read first). I believe this demonstrates what a poor introduction to Faulkner this novel can be.So, here is how I came to understand Faulkner's work: Having first read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and then Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus, I was a little more prepared than most; Thomas Mann and James Joyce were both key influences on Faulkner's writing style. When my father recommended I read him, and then my AP US History teacher, I decided to try Absalom, Absalom! In all honesty, after working my way through Rosa Compson's seemingly endless monologues, The Sound and the Fury was like a walk in the park.While I don't recommend taking this particular route, I would strongly suggest reading at least one of Thomas Mann's novels, and dipping your toe into the works of James Joyce. Death in Venice is a good place to start, however of Mann's entire oeuvre, Buddenbrooks is what Faulkner really identified with (Woods translation, not Lowe-Porter.) Although Portrait of the Artist can seem a little daunting at first (not to mention boh-riiing!), with a good enough set of end-notes it is more than possible to grasp the humor and playfulness of Joyce's style. I'd suggest Seamus Deane's notes for Penguin Classics, myself.Marilynne Robinson's introduction carries every bit as much deep thought and spiritual force as any of her fine novels. I must admit, The Sound and the Fury can be confusing, but however much Googling a character chart seems like it would help, I would highly suggest reading the novel before the introduction, or any supplementary material. Faulkner's form is nothing if not precise, and if you find out certain details about certain characters even a smidgen too early, it can effectively ruin the Gothic atmosphere of the entire work. I almost had this happen to me when I started using a study guide with Absalom, Absalom! (Rosa is just so longwinded!), and I was kicking myself for days.Above all I'd suggest reading any other Faulkner novel before embarking on this one. As I Lay Dying is a fine place to start, as is Light in August. It's important to remember, The Sound and the Fury is considered one of the hardest novels in American literature for a reason. There's no point in burning yourself on the first go-round with any author, least of all one as worthwhile as Faulkner.
A1CECYH8RQE901	0	1	When listening to this disc, I thought everything was going great... until I got to the Cowell. I have no beef with Lawrence Gwozdz; he's a fantastic saxophonist, but I was very surprised to hear this recording coming from him. When one listens to this part of the disc, it sounds as if it was recorded sometime in the 60s. In addition, many of the runs in the Husa and the Cowell sound as if they are fudged, more gliss than clean run.The Husa is particularly bad--there are dynamics and very important crescendos--particularly at the climax of the elegie--which are simply ignored. In addition, he takes way too much liberty in his "dramatic pauses," such as right before going into the crazy forth-octave altissimo, completely breaking the rhythmic backbone of the piece, which is a shame in such a vital work as this one. I know he is capable of far better than this--just listen to the version he recorded with the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic. It may not be the greatest version I've ever heard , but it is a far more satisfying rendering than this. I think my favorite rendition I've heard is the chamber version by Harry Kinross White, who, one might note, studied with Dr. Gwozdz, but also Sigurd Rascher.The Cowell Air and Scherzo is almost worse. If the acoustics weren't bad enough, the mic placement makes it very obvious where he is stopping one take and starting another in the Scherzo, a major blunder, one almost unheard of in professional recordings.(Try just listen 43 seconds in, and also between the contrasting slow section and the recapitulation). That is what shocked me most about this recording. After hearing it happen so obviously, one can hardly listen to the rest of the cd without hearing it there too: whether 30 seconds into the Worley Sonata's first movement, many, many times in the third movement, or 3 minutes and 15 seconds into the Rondeau of the Husa, these gaping holes seem to be everywhere! It's really a shame, because this is the only recording on the market of the Antique Dances, Particles, Air and Scherzo, and Beyond these hills.It is worth noting that the concerto disc by Gwozdz mostly has different repertoire by the same composers, but also has the Elegie/Rondeau, Romance, and Jephthah that is on this disc, only in orchestral form. The performances are far better, so I would not hesitate to get that disc instead.
A1CEENWZVCZOG3	1	1	My wife and I fell in love with this series. We are not vampire fanatics, but then this series offered so much more. Romance, mystery, crime, street justice. Like so many series we became hooked on, this one did not survive. I'm beginning to think the studios will soon be writing to us begging us NOT to watch their series.
A1CEENWZVCZOG3	1	0	I REALLY don't like heavy metal music, all just sounds like a bunch of screaming to me, but I LOVED this movie!! There really isn't that much footage of this band or others playing the music, it's not about that. This movie is all about chasing the dream.Other reviewers have noted that this film does not have a happy ending, but I think that has changed. Just tonight I saw an ad on VH1 about the Anvil tour that is coming up, and now most if not all of their music is available right here on Amazon.It's kind of funny. This movie about chasing a fleeting dream has actually helped that dream come true! If you've ever been in a band or even just wanted to be in a band of any kind, watch this movie.
A1CEENWZVCZOG3	1	1	In my experience, there are few "extended cuts" out there that are really worth buying if you already own the theatrical version, but this one definately is!! I stumbled across this version on cable one day and I was blown away. The scenes that have been put back in REALLY make this movie much better than the theatrical release, and I loved that version.I do have to offer one bit of warning though, after watching this film you will develope a strong desire to run right out and buy yourself a set of drums.....or maybe that's just me.....I haven't done it yet but I sure want to.
A1CEPDC0WJXES	0	1	I found out about this band from the new issue of Spin where they talk about the best punk cds ever. I dont think ill be checking out n e of the other bands on the list because so far theyve all been really bad. This might just be the wrost of them all. Fugazi cant sing they cant play and this cd sounds like it was recorded in a closet. If this is punk, then punk must be dead.
A1CEPDC0WJXES	1	1	This is 1 of the best bands ive heard in a while. They sound a lot like Rage Against The Machine but the only problem with this cd is that there singer really cant rap. I'm not dissing the dude or anything but if u stack his rapping skills up 2 Fred Durst or Zach from RATM then ull see that he really cant rap 2 good. Its a good cd thouhg and u need 2 get this be4 they sellout n e more. Ive been a fan of this band sinse day 1 and teenyboppers are starting 2 like them.
A1CER4OEADXQ68	0	0	I was shocked when I got this book and was looking through the pages (by the way, the recipes themselves look good) to find that it was MISSING several pages!!!! I wrote to Amazon but all they did was give me a partial refund! THAT does not help me make the recipes with missing directions! I will look for this book in a bookstore and check it carefully before buying it again.
A1CER4OEADXQ68	1	1	This is a really nice book of nicely illustrated and easy to use graphic organizers. My students enjoy using them! I would recommend this to any teacher who wants to help their students organize their thoughts in a simple way.
A1CEZV68FGN9YW	1	1	I own a Bose Wave Music System and was surprised at how great it was was when I first heard it. The SoundDock surprised my first with how small it was, then with how loud it could get; I have yet to have any distortion problem.Cons:The remote is simple, and my Nano dock doesn't exactly fit. Also, it is a one purpose machine, iPod and that's it.Pros:Great sounding music. If you have been impressed with Bose sound in the past you will not be dissapointed.

A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	I watched this doc on free speech tv last Sunday and was blown away by it. I new some of the things in it as far as why meat isn't good for you but the way the health ramifications, as well as environmental impact, for eating it made me totally reconcider the way I eat. I've avoided eating meat most of this week by about 95 percent. I just cannot get the facts in this video out of my head. I really get the feeling that eventually I will be done with meat all together some day, wonder what it will be like to one day walk past the meat section at the grocery store without a thought of it, but for now baby steps. I want to seriously give this new way of eating a try.

A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	Straight off the boat and sucked into the criminal life, that's the american dream hu! Friends in need, cab rides, drug drop offs, gangs from every bureau, psychos, car thieves, jumping into helicoptors, out running the law, quietly taking care of problems, or blowing them up, car chases galore, and the weapons I could go on forever but I won't.Getting people drunk is one of my favorite things to do, just to see how they all act. From Jacob being "mash up" to Kate and Packie saying they wanna die and fallin' all over, it's great! Bernie nearly made me piss myself many times "maybe he wants to kill me because i'm FAAAABBBUUULLLOUSSSS"! Brucie has issues. Roman is a man whore but a nice guy. This ones a definite must have. Wasn't a fan of GTA until this one got into our collection. Loved ever minute!Stay safe, stay second Amendment!
A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	Really, since I played this game I've read up on the 12th century cities of Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascas and this exciting and dangerous period of time. I found the dialog really interesting too. Whoever thought just pushing someone or making them drop something could be could be considered almost getting someone killed? Such drama! Climbing up the side of a building can get you shouts of "what a fool" or "when is he going to stop acting like a child". Pushy beggers, kife carrying fat guys with nasty attitudes(round boys), silent scholars, suspicion of everything you do "why is he doing that?"I love the open world layout, design of the clothing, landscapes, missions are great. You get to save people in distress from the thug guards that manhandle whoever and whenever they choose. It's funny, everyone is soo horrified about a guard being killed but no one cares about the poor slob rotting on the side of the street with the arrow sticking out of his chest and the flies buzzing all around!The flags can be difficult to collect. Still have trouble finding a bunch of them. Even with a good cheat sheet with the flags on it, I still can't find some of them.Glad I got this for my husband on Christmas so I can enjoy it!
A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	May contain spoilers!I borrowed this game through GameFly. Thought I would of played this game once and sent it back and that would be it, but I just bought it for the collection. I loved the story line, liked that you can choose which sex you want to be, great side missions, like the idea that you can have all the fun you want with whoever you want, even get married a few times and have kids with em' all. Just make sure the families are far away from each other. Your ability to stay good looking depends on your food choices. I am so glad that YouTube is around, I use it every time I get stuck on something. You can take jobs to earn gold fast. You can use it to buy property to rent out to increase your income and buy vendor stands. Fell in love with the dog! He's more valuable then the spouses being he finds everything. And he's a real cutie and totally loyal.

The mission is indefinite occupation. I don't support these guys or anyone else who goes the Iraq or Afganistan. Any anywhere else in the middle east for that matter. Other young people thinking about signing up should see this documentary first and then decide. But just know when you do, your getting a front row seat to the show. The recruiters may tell you they won't send you there, but thats where you going. Once they got you, they got you. And they will do what they want with you.
A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	I used mine for the first time this week. I don't like tampons so I wasn't sure how I would like it, but I really think this product is terrific. I checked it every four to six hours at first to gauge how often to remove, clean and replace it. No leaks to worry about with the thick rim that prevents it from leaking. It is not messy like tampons and pads, and it will definitely be a money saver. Not to mention the waste not going to the landfill. Wish I knew of this cup a long time ago.
A1CFG7PARMBSEO	1	1	My husband discovered them a few months ago. Didn't know what to make of The Darkness at first but I've come around. We just saw them in A.C last month and they are terrific in concert. There were a few incidents with Dan's guitar. They were in the second song, Black Schuck, when the electric died on Dan right before the solo! He was sitting there strumming the strings but nothing was happening. Everything just stopped. There was all this scrambling going on with but eventually it got fixed. Justin was teasing Dan the whole time which made it even funnier and also talked about a racy email he got from a girl to pass the time. Later in the show, Dan's guitar strap snapped in half.They were a lot of fun, putting on an excellent show. Justin is a great entertainer. He threw in some robot dancing, scissoring headstands, and David Lee Roth jumps into the mix. I definitely wouldn't mind seeing them a bunch more times.
A1CFU8T76H5G51	1	1	I wanted a replacement phone when the caller id went on my own phone. I also wanted a phone that would still work in the case of a blackout. This one fits the bill and also has a cordless handset for when you do have electricity. The only issues I have is that the handset is much bigger than most cordless phones nowadays. The answering machine is also a redundant feature cause most phone services come with voicemail but still not bad for the price
A1CFU8T76H5G51	1	1	..they are just fine. I'm always baking cupcakes/muffins to snack on so I go thru a lot of cupcake cups. These are perfectly functional and bake just fine. I wouldn't recommend them for any special occasions or presentations though.

After the very first use the "coating" started flaking off. The neext roasting left it rusting and the 3rd roasting I lined it with foil and could barely get the foil out. Not worth the thirty bucks.

A1CGCI27A2K1O	1	1	The photo shows a drain and feed hose but the feed was actually a female hose connector soldered directly on the end of the copper pipe. That means I had to buy an additional short hose to get it to the kitchen faucet. Because the only one I could find at the right length was a clothes washer/dishwasher hose with two female connectors, I also needed an adapter. This added about $15 to the cost. Other than that, it's the perfect size for the 4-gallon pot I use for the wort boil. It should also work just fine for a 7.5 gallon pot by stretching out the coil more. If you do your boil outside and use the garden hose, it will hook right in with no additional parts.
A1CGCI27A2K1O	1	1	A very nice green laser that you can use for a star gazing pointer. It also has LEDs to use it as a white and red flashlight. If you haven't used one of these, the green laser is visible when pointed into the sky if you're looking close to in-line with the beam. It's very handy for pointing things out to someone else. It's rather bright for something like an office presentation pointer.
A1CGCI27A2K1O	1	1	The initial operation looks excellent. I got two of these for the office and home so had 4 units to test out. All of them read the same after they acclimated so the factory calibration is consistent. I didn't have a humidity reference but they did match my home thermostat for temperature. The real test is to see how they operate over the long term.For some of the negative reviews, this unit is not made by Honeywell but by Hideki and sold under the Honeywell brand. Hideki is not a no name company, but a large multinational company that has been around 20 years. They're just relatively new to the US.For the hygrometer taking a while to adjust after a reset, that is expected. All electronic hygrometers take a couple hours to stabilize after being reset or moved into a new location.
A1CGCI27A2K1O	0	1	This gets the job done but there's better designs available.The tank is angled the top which means it won't sit flat in the sink when you're trying to fill it up. The fill hole is only slightly larger than what you'd find on a soda bottle, so you can't fill it up quickly in the tub. The small opening also means it doesn't dry out quickly.For reasons beyond all understanding, they put in a very bright light you can't turn off. If you want to use it in a bedroom, you might have a hard time sleeping with it on.It's pretty quiet but definitely louder than other ultrasonic vaporizers I've used.Overall I would look at one of the Vicks units instead.
A1CGCI27A2K1O	1	0	Just in the first few days using this charger, I was able to recover $70 or so worth of batteries I thought were goners. It's also a solid compact design and easy to use.One thing I think they could improve is the instructions. I already knew what values to set from using R/C chargers, but I think someone without any experience with configurable chargers would find it confusing. A picture of where to find capacity on your batteries and a chart of capacity verse recommended charge current would be helpful. It also prompts for discharge current but says nothing about what value to use.
A1CGCI27A2K1O	1	1	The saw seems solidly built and cuts well. I had to cut some branches damaged by the storms last week that were maybe 5" diameter pecan, and it got the job done in quickly and easily. It comes complete with a bottle of chain oil if you don't have some laying around. This is just an attachment, so the performance will depend on the power of the motor you use.
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	1	1	Every "live" art can be legitimately revisited, and renewed with new talent and perspective. This is a wonderful new recording in which, perhaps, new stars are being born. If this form and these sentiments someday die out, then I want to disappear with them. But not to worry, I believe there will always be an audience for such creativity, whimsy, quality, emotions and affection. In the CD notes the composer writes of sometimes having composed without a piano, where he could "easily gravitate toward the same old chords and clich&eacute;s." He wrote this music almost 50 years ago! The Fantasticks might not quite make it into the pantheon of American Musical Theatre, but almost. And this new recording is delightful. May it run in NYC for another 40 years.
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	1	1	I'll never forget hearing this music for the first time, in 1993 or 1994 at a sampling station at Borders. I have to admit I was intrigued by the cover photograph likely taken at a cemetery, of a spider web-draped angel statute. That was when CDs were still new, and my first thought was "This is the perfect sound for CDs: clear, quiet, ethereal." I bought the handsome 2-CD package then and there, and my interest in this unique musical project has gradually matured in the past decade. Most recently, following a significant family death in 2002, I've started a personal tradition of spending New Year's Eve alone at home, with only candles burning after 7:00 p.m., listing to recordings of great requiems (Mozart, Durufle, Rutter and Verdi) and The Hilliard Ensemble's Officium (translated to sense of duty, respect, service and allegiance). Spending the last day of the year this way is comforting, and allows me to continue to grieve appropriately. Officium transports me to another place and time, quasi-religious, celestial, meditative. The solo saxophone calls out as if speaking, questioning, affirming. It's not for everyone. This recording will never climb the charts, especially in today's shallow world of noise and self-importance. I would say if you're an "old soul," try listening to this gift of creativity and inspiration. It just might become one of the most valuable recordings you own - as it has for me ...
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	0	1	This product gets 1 star for being current and interactive, but it didn't tell me anything I don't already know -- at least anything that's actually useful, interesting or helpful. You'll do just as well to wander around Berlin on your own, without seeing this rather strange travelogue. It was hardly worth the time to go through it, let alone paying approximately $20. My best description of it is that it could easily be loaded on any hotel room TV in Berlin for free viewing.
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	0	0	I ordered this CD based on the playlist, and upon receiving it was impressed with its graphic design and personal meditation written by Mr. Sowash in the accompanying pamphlet. But then I listened to this recording and was deeply disappointed. Mr. Sowash's touch on the piano is heavy, and densely filled. I enjoyed not one cut, even the songs I love. I don't want to be cruel, but in my opinion this is marginal artistry not deserving of wide distribution.
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	0	0	I'm a lifelong fan of Joni, and listened to this "album" with anticipation. The first 4 cuts, by contemporary artists, were unlistenable. Then it gets better, but still with misfires by Prince and Elvis Costello. The only great selection is k.d. lang's Help Me, followed by Emmylou Harris' The Magdalene Laundries and Cassandra Wilson's For the Roses, which is not enough quality to merit buying the CD or keeping it (I'm giving away the one I purchased). This was a good effort, but overall it fails.
A1CGDKBEQ8PS3S	0	0	I ordered this knowing it was a chance, not being able to listen to any samples. If I had been able to preview I wouldn't have ordered it. This ensemble isn't without quality or style, just not for the non-Celtic of heart. I'll be donating this to my local public library.
A1CGUAE49P7H85	1	1	This book is an eye opener, revealing wonderful scientific facts about the universe that support the Biblical accounts of Creation and the Flood. I used data on supernovae from this book to silence the atheists on an aol comment site. When I began to post, I was the only Christian on the board. When I ceased to comment, there were only Christians on the board. There is a great need to get these truths out into the world. People are deciding to live their lives as if God were a fantasy, which leads to horrendously tragic mistakes, a heartless society, and a messed-up world. This book is like a light shining in the darkness. Enjoy!
A1CGUAE49P7H85	1	1	Top notch acting, great (black and white) cinematography, laugh-out-loud funny screenplay, and attractive leading actors all combine for an enjoyable escape into the world of espionage in pre-WWII Soviet Union. For history buffs: the grandfather of the director was himself a refugee from the Communist world, so this director accurately lampoons it in this film. (Unfortunately, there are Americans today who display an attitude closer to those denizens of the USSR than to 1940 America; those folks may not think this movie is funny.) But, if you laugh at "I Love Lucy," you'll laugh at this movie, too.
A1CGUAE49P7H85	1	1	I couldn't put this book down. It is well written, and well documented. This should be required reading for all Americans who vote, or who intend to vote one day.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	THE BLACK PIRATE has everything you could want in a seafaring adventure: cutthroat pirates, swordplay, a damsel in distress, and Doug Fairbanks swinging, leaping, and diving into action. Adding to the visual splendor is the two color Technicolor (still a highly experimental process at the time this movie was made), which has been carefully and gorgeously restored for this video release.Douglas Fairbanks is at his athletic and romantic best and his supporting cast is top notch. Billie Dove is a true vision of loveliness as the kidnapped princess and villainous Sam De Grasse's minimalist style contrasts well with Fairbanks' exuberance. The video is blessed with the original 1926 score, conducted by Robert Israel, and a bonus section of outtakes and production photos, narrarated by film historian Rudy Behlmer.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	While BONNIE SCOTLAND doesn't qualify as a classic, it's still lots of fun for Laurel and Hardy fans. The film's main problem is it's uncomfortable grafting of the boy's comedy onto a melodramatic B-picture storyline. June Lang and William Janney are the romantic leads, but unfortunately their roles are rather shallow and unsympathetic. Thankfully, Stan and Ollie's scenes are good enough to keep the film moving and enjoyable. Highlights include the boys innocently wreaking havoc in a Scottish boarding house, their improvised dance to &quot;One Hundred Pipers,&quot; and Stan's constant inability to keep in step with the rest of the Scottish army unit! There are also good comic moments from James Finalyson, Mary Gordon and diminutive Daphne Pollard (hilarious as a cockney chambermaid). The picture and sound on this video transfer are sharp and clear.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN gave a real boost to the comedy team's film career; it's an excellent film and one of the boys' few true classics. A well crafted script provides plenty of laughs while allowing the monsters to play straight, which heightens the comedy. Bela Lugosi (Dracula), Lon Chaney, Jr. (The Wolfman), and Glenn Strange (The Monster) work well opposite Bud and Lou and approprately monstrous. Lenore Aubert is also quite good as Dracula's glamourous partner in crime.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	Made for peanuts, BUCK PRIVATES was a tremendous hit for Universal studios and firmly established Abbott and Costello as movie stars. Bud and Lou's routines are among their best; indeed, the film is really not much more than a string of burlesque routines held together by a simple plotline. &quot;The Dice Game,&quot; &quot;The Drill Routine,&quot; &quot;You're 40, She's 10,&quot; and several others burlesque bits are here to keep you laughing. The romantic triangle plot is rather forgettable, although one can certainly understand why both Lee Bowman and Alan Curtis are pursuing lovely Jane Frazee. The Andrews Sisters contribute some great songs, including the immortal &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.&quot; Dated but still very entertaining, BUCK PRIVATES delivered just what the movie going public needed in 1941. And it still delivers today.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	THE COCOANUTS is historically significant as one of the first all-talking, all-singing musical films. It's also significant for unleashing the Marx Brothers onto the movie going public. THE COCOANUTS gave filmgoers a taste of what had Broadway audiences rolling in the aisle and while the film suffers from the static production typical of early musicals, it remains very entertaining thanks to the brothers' anarchic comedy. Director Robert Florey did use some innovative camera shots to help overcome the staginess (i.e. part of Chico's piano solo is shot head-on through the raised piano lid; a novel touch at the time). For many years, THE COCOANUTS was only available in generally awful prints with muddy soundtracks; recently portions of the film in mint condition have come to light, so while it's not a complete restoration, the film looks and sounds better than it has in years. For all it's faults, including an oddly forgettable Irving Berlin score, THE COCOANUTS still provides plenty of laughs.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	Stan Laurel and Babe Hardy didn't have many good things to say about their Fox and MGM films of the 1940's. So the legend has persisted that these films, with a couple of possibleexceptions, are unspeakable horrors and hardly worth the trouble of taking them out of the film can. Of course, at the big movie &quot;factories,&quot; the boys were denied the kind of creative freedom they had enjoyed at the Hal Roach Studios, and their work suffered accordingly. But the time has finally come for a reevaluation of these later films. Scott MacGillivray has done just that in FROM THE FORTIES FORWARD. While Scott doesn't shy away from criticizing the weaknesses, he demonstrates that these films are frequently much better than their reputations would lead you to believe. There is also excellent coverage of Stan and Babe's European tours, the Robert Youngson compilations, the sometimes maze-like process of film reissues, and Laurel and Hardy on television. An essential book for Laurel and Hardy fans, and an excellent companion piece to both THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES and LAUREL OR HARDY.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	Rob Stone is to be congratulated for taking on the Herculean (and seemingly impossible) task of documenting all of Stan Laurel's and Babe Hardy's solo film appearances. The comedians frequently worked for small studios that are long since gone, and many of the films apparently no longer exist. Stone has done a superb job of detective work and documentation, and leaves open the possibility of further discoveries; indeed, since this book was published, a previously unknown Oliver Hardy film has surfaced! An essential volume for silent film and comedy buffs. And for fans of the boys, this is a great companion piece to both THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES and FROM THE FORTIES FORWARD.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	THE MIKADO is likely Gilbert and Sullivan's best loved operetta and it's heard here in a splendid recording. True, there is some surface noise, as this was originally released as a set of 78 rpm records, but the sound is sharp and clear and the surface noise doesn't distract. Best of all, this 1926 recording preserves superb musical performances by many members of the D'Oyly Carte Company (With one ad-libbed exception, there is no spoken dialogue). Henry Lytton (Koko), Leo Sheffield (Pooh Bah), and others (before or behind the microphones) had the good fortune to work with Gilbert and/or Sullivan, so we can assume the performances are generally faithful to the Savoy tradition. Also included is an abreviated 1933 recording of THE SORCERER. It's also an excellent recording, but only a few D'Oyly Carte principals appear. The comic lead of John Wellington Wells is taken by George Baker, a singer who was never a member of the DOC, but gives a performance worthy of any Savoyard (In the MIKADO section, he sings the role of Pish Tush). After hearing this &quot;highlights&quot; version of THE SORCERER, you may well wonder why it isn't staged more often.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	Randy Skretvedt has written what is arguably the single best book on Laurel and Hardy and their movies. Carefully researched and just plain fun to read, this revised edition includes details on recent discoveries, such as a silent Charley Chase comedy in which the boys appear, and some of the Spanish language &quot;remakes&quot; that were made in the early 1930's for the foreign market. An absolutely indepensable book for comedy buffs and L&amp;H fans, and a essential companion piece to LAUREL OR HARDY and FROM THE FORTIES FORWARD.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	THE THREE AGES is Buster Keaton's parody of D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE. Buster and Wallace Beery star as romantic rivals for the hand of pretty Margaret Leahy. The twist is that the story is told thrice by intercutting between three time periods: prehistoric, Ancient Rome, and Modern Times (1920's). The gags are fast and furious and many are truly surreal; highlights include caveman Buster attempting to woo Amazonian Blanche Payson, a Roman chariot race hindered by snow(!), and a beautifully constructed chase sequence with Buster escaping from a police station and inadvertantly returning there a few minutes later. The Kino source print has apparently been pieced together from the best available materials and with a few minor exceptions is sharp and clear. It also has a nicely done music score conducted by Robert Israel. As a sidenote, many filmographies list Oliver Hardy in the cast. The actor in question is in fact a near-Hardy lookalike named Kewpie Morgan.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	While Mark Wade's KIDSHOW VENTRILOQUISM is aimed at the ventriloquist who entertains kids (you might have guessed this from the title!), it has valuable information for ANY entertainer who works with kids. Whether you venue is schools, birthday parties, libraries, whether you are an amateur vent or pro, you will get the benefit of Mark's knowledge learned from his many years in the business. And if you are a magician or clown who would like to add some vent to your act, there is a lot of useful information here. KIDSHOW VENTRILOQUISM has a place on every entertainer's bookshelf. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	Jerome Kern's and Oscar Hammerstein's SHOWBOAT is a landmark Broadway musical. It was brought to the screen in 1936 by Universal Studios with most of it's drama, joy, and heartbreak intact. James Whale (BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE INVISIBLE MAN) might seem an odd choice for this project, yet his direction hits the mark: realistic and gritty when it needs to be, stylized and theatrical when it can afford to be. The film is blessed with a magnificent cast, most of whom had previously played their roles on stage: Irene Dunne played Magnolia in the 1927 touring company, Allan Jones appeared as Ravenal in summer stock, and Paul Robeson starred as Joe in the 1928 London production and then again in the 1932 Broadway revival. Charles Winninger, Helen Morgan, and the underrated Sammy White starred in the 1927 and 1932 Broadway productions and understand their characters thoroughly. White's eccentric dancing is hilarious and Morgan's turn as the tragic Julie may well have you fighting back tears. While some favorite songs are missing, three were written specifically for the movie; one of them,&quot;I Have The Room Above Her,&quot; found it's way into the recent Broadway revival directed by Harold Prince. SHOWBOAT isn't perfect: Hammerstein's screenplay unnecessarily alters the final section of the story, and Irene Dunne's performance in blackface of &quot;Gallivantin' Around&quot; might possibly offend some in this day and age. But SHOWBOAT has so much to delight and engage the viewer that these minor flaws can, and should, be overlooked. By the way, keep an eye open for Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson in the opening scenes.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	0	1	Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were nearing the end of their reign as Universal's top comedians by the time MEET THE KEYSTONE KOPS was made, and it did indeed seem as if the bottom of the barrel were being scraped to find ideas for the boys' films. While hardly a classic, KEYSTONE KOPS at least has an interesting concept that appears to be partly inspired by Lou's early career as a movie stuntman. There is more slapstick than usual for A&amp;C, and a few hair raising stunts, which is appropriate for a comedy set in Hollywood circa 1912. Fred Clark gives the film a real boost as a swindler turned movie director; he is an excellent foil for Bud and Lou. Comedy legend Mack Sennett makes a welcome and all too brief appearance as himself. Keep an eye out for veteran Keystone comedians Herold Goodwin, Hank Mann, and Heinie Conklin. Lou's daughter Carole does a brief bit with her dad at the beginning of the film. Recommended for kids, die hard A&amp;C fans, and anyone wanting to relax with some nostalgic nonsense.
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	If you don't like Gilbert and Sullivan, you should avoid TOPSY-TURVY; clocking in at about two hours and forty minutes, it would probably be a torturous experience. For everyone else, however, I give this movie my highest recommendation. TOPSY-TURVY concerns itself with a period during which Gilbert and Sullivan find themselves at a professional impasse. Their inability to agree on a suitable story for collaboration eventually leads to their most popular operetta, &quot;The Mikado.&quot; Director Mike Leigh's object, however, is to tell the story behind the story; he lets us peek into the professional and personal lives of Sullivan, Gilbert, and the D'Oyly Carte Company. Jim Broadbent anchors the film with his tremendous performance as W.S. Gilbert; he is infuriating and arrogant, yet plagued with self doubt and even occasionally gentle. Alan Cordeneur does well as Arthur Sullivan, yet his performance is less involving and we don't get to know him that well; but perhaps that was the point. Leslie Manville is quite touching as Gilbert's long suffering wife, Kitty. The D'Oyly Carte performers are played with just the right combination of humanity and theatricality; in particular, Timothy Spall as Richard Temple (bewildered and hurt that his role as the Mikado might be whittled to almost nothing!) and Dorothy Atkinson, charming and alluring as Jessie Bond, are outstanding. There are generous musical excerpts from &quot;The Mikado,&quot; &quot;The Sorcerer,&quot; &quot;Princess Ida,&quot; and Sullivan's non-Gilbert music. There is so much more worth praising in TOPSY-TURVY, but instead I'll just close by saying: DON'T MISS IT!
A1CH1UP6JFR247	1	1	SONS OF THE DESERT is one of Laurel and Hardy's finest films. This gem of a comedy really deserves to be restored, remastered and re-released on video. Like many of the boys' best comedies, the premise is simple: Stan and Ollie try to outsmart their wives so they can attend their lodge convention. Naturally, whenever Stan and Ollie put they're heads together, disaster is never far behind. SONS is full of inventive touches and great dialogue (i.e. Ollie is expecting a doctor; Ollie:&quot;Why did you get a veteranarian?&quot; Stan:&quot;Well, I didn't think is religion would make any difference.&quot;). The unjustly neglected comedian Charley Chase is outstanding as a loud-mouthed conventioneer who befriends Stan and Ollie. Mae Busch is in top form as the shrewish Mrs. Hardy. SONS OF THE DESERT is a thorough delight from beginning to end.
A1CH6R09W01JDA	1	1	This is perfect for our two cats they love to curl up in this all day long. My dog even tried sleeping in it though she didn't fit. I'll be getting a larger one for her to. The medium size is a little big for normal cats but ours are large so the size is perfect for them. It is probably perfect size for a cocker spaniel or similar size dog.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	This book shows the state of the world in the 1930's, before the outbreak of WWII.A great love story and after all sorts of setbacks and disappointments, true love finally prevailed.It was written after all the convulsive changes had taken place -the end of British rule in Asia; the lessening of racial bigotry between whites and non-whites; the eroding of tension between Malays and Chinese. All these had gradually taken place after end of WWII.It had a retrospective look but it was done marvellously well.I am somewhat surprised that the author was not really a novelist but a journalist. He did a great job in producing this novel
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	A very good and in-depth look at one of the most contraversial men in Modern Chinese history.Chiang was a typical Chinese of the past generation.He was vicious, authoritarian, inflexible and narrow-minded. He had brought a lot of miseries and sufferings to China and the Chinese people. But I am inclined to believe that the Chinese people were partly to blame. Up until recently the ideas of democracy and equality never entered the China mind depite appreciation of Western ideas and philosophy. I understand that F.D. Roosevelt considered getting rid of him but the Chinese people could not have a leader replaced unless death or convulsive revolution took place.I do give him credit for letting his son run the country in his later years without interfering. The younger Chiang worked hard in economic development and made Taiwan one of the tigers of South East Asia.I would urge politicians of both China and Taiwan to read this book carefully so as to make China a true modern and democratic state.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	I like this memoir very much. Unfortunately, I cannot verify the accuracy and truthfulness of the contents.Chiang Kai Shek's life and personality are little known. Except for the biography by Brian Crozier, this is the only book about the private life and personality of Chiang that I am aware of. Now that China is a much more open society, I hope that more such books will become available
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	Gavin Menzies should be commended for doing such detailed research and analyses. From what I understand, he is neither a scholar nor a sinologist but a navy man. He has written an excellent book.Had the voyages and ship-building continued, China would have been a great maritime(and possibly colonial) power. I must say that this book should be a research paper or a Ph.D thesis. These events are not considered significant in Chinese history and it is doublful if too many people are interested in reading or studying this book
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	For a beginner, this is an excellent introductory book. I specially like the disk which will enable a crude unix system to be available on the PC. Of course, more examples and excercises could be made available. I highly recommend it to all beginners.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	0	I have been researching TM for the past few months. I have resisted going to class because it is quite expensive and because I do not believe, as the expert on TM Robert Roth claimed , -that TM could not be learnt from a book or tape. This is an ideal book. I am quite convinced that TM is just a way to invoke the power and wisdom of the subconscious mind. There are other techniques - affirmative prayer, auto-suggestion, Silva Mind Control and self-hypnosis and they are just as effective and useful. TM is good but it should be not considered infallible magic.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	This book is unique in that unlike most books telling readers how great TM is, White gives the pros and cons of TM from every view point. The implication I get is that TM works for some people some of the time but not for everybody all the time. No doubt further research and probings are required. To me, everyone who wants to learn TM should read this book carefully.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	It was a fascinating and thrilling experience to read this book. Wallace certainly had great insights and a wealth of knowledge. My impression after reading this book is that Nobel prize winners are not saints not super human beings but just like you and me with hopes fears and human problems but somehow, by luck, their achievements had turned out to be unique and acclaimed.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	0	0	The title is certainly impressive, one book to review all the IT topics required for the CCP exam.But it is just another text book and very difficult to read and absorb. it should be fairly obvious that people reading a book of this nature are knowledgeable and experienced in IT and just need a book to co-ordinate and summarise all the topics and ideas in order to pass the CCP exam. To me, it should be written concisely with various topics and diagrams and in point form so as to facilitate revision . This book is quite difficult to read and time-consuming to get through. There is a book 'Introduction to Business Information Systems' by J.K Pierson, a Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich College Outline Series which seems to serve the purpose. Unfortunately, it was written in 1988, is considerably outdated and a new revised edition never came outThere are a few excellent British books which are not intended for CCP exams but which cover the topics adequately and present them in a easy-to-read format. Go searching
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	This is a very well written book - clear, concise and great for revision and quick review. Unfortunately, it is quite a bit outdated and a revised edition never came out. I would urge the author or publisher to consider putting out a revised edition.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	This ia a very detailed and readable book about China and her forced entry into the world.I would caution those who advocate free trade to read it carefully and do some serious thinking. Free trade is good but could be abused with no moral standards. When a stronger power forced a weak country to go for free trade using military might with no moral restrains, the outcome could be devastating with serious repercussions for ages. Hopefully such things will never happen again
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	Here is abook about Mao from someone who had never met or interviewed him (my own supposition) Of course, it is different from 'Red Star Over China' by Edgar Snow with face to face interviews with Mao. But I do think the author has wriiten a very good and comprehensive book.There are two things that bother me. This book ends with the founding of the People's Republic of China. Who knew that there were more spectacular things to come ? (The Korean War, the purges in the 1950's, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and the power struggle with Lin Biao) Secondly, Mao wrote a lot of good poems, but translating them into English makes those poems meaningless and obsolete.Mr Chen, can you write a sequel ?
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	For me who watched Walter Cronkite almost every night from the 1960's to the 1980's when Dan Rather took over, this is most enlightening book. Behind the scene stories were given for a lot of news stories. Unlike Eric Sevaried, Cronkite never stated any of his personal feelings and comments on the air. Quite a lot of them were found in this book.Two things bother me. None of the chapters in this book had a topic so the reader is completely unaware of what is in there when he/she starts reading a chapter. In addition, no index is avalable and locating a topic or name is very difficult and time-consuming
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	0	0	John Foster Dulles should be ashamed for his book. I do not know him personally but this book shows that he was an ignorant lunatic and a true disciple of Jo McCarthy. While we in the western world do not favor Communism, it is silly and idiotic to treat it as a contagious disease. With an open door policy, we could show the people in Communist countries that our system is better and in every way gives people security and pleasure. The worst thing to do is, as Dulles advocated, to to fight them head on. Dulles must have contributed a lot to the utterly crazy Cold War tension and perhaps the Vietnam War. I am glad that finally the American people had come to their senses, adopted an open-door policy with Russia and China and made the world much safer and happier. Dulles is no longer alive and I hope he will rot in hell
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	Tom Brokaw has wriiten quite a good book using the common men and women as the forces of retrospection. Of course, he only mentions people he knew or came across in the generation, missing out a lot of others.The only comment I would like to make is that Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr should not be included or mentioned. Schlesinger was an historian but to me, he never measured up to the greatness of William Prescott, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Arnold J. Tonybee or Barbara Tuchman. He didn't seem to have fired a single shot or shed a drop of blood during the War. His work at the OSS during the War was quite hazy and murky. I am quite disgusted with his biased and one-sided opinion of the Kennedys
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	A very detailed and well-written book. One can't help getting edgy and scared after reading it. How could such things take place in free,democratic U.S.A. ? I am inclied to see that the U.S. had very serious social problems in the 1960's especially with young people. Of course the birth control pill, the Negro revolution and the war in Vietnam all played significant roles. It is time to see if such social problems still exist. If so, more shocking and grisly things are still to come.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	0	1	It has been almost 100 years since the publication of the book "The Secret Doctrine ". The ideas in this book and quite obscure and none of them has been correctly verified or confirmedIt is neither a popular nor a great book.Now the author in this book considers H.P. Blavatsky as a saint or super genius. There is a lot of details about her life . But these are only for those who strongly agree with and believe in her teachings - there are not too many.I am surprised that someone bothers to research into the life ofan obscure person hardly recognised in the world
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	I was first introduced to the life of Mao by Edgar Snow's book 'Red Star Over China' I was greatly impressed with Mao. Then came the 1960's with the Cultural Revolution. I could not believe some of the crazy things initiated by Mao. This has been perplexing me ever since. This book is certainly a rude awakening for me. I can see that Snow's book was one-sided and highly biased. Here is finally a book written by a Chinese (I mean Chang) who grew up in China, lived through those turbulent times and did a fair amount of research in producing this book. While no one can prove the correctness and authenticities of all instances mentioned in this book, it certainly has been able to explain a lot of things that happened. Snow was genuine but he spent only a short time in Yenan and interviewed only Mao and Mao's men. Other books such as those by Ross Terill and Jerome Chen were far less detailed and authentic. I highly recommend this book
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	A very exciting and well-wriiten book. I couldn't put it down till I have finished the last line.While it is true that two EDS employees were rescued and smuggled out of Iran, the details were obtained from EDS men and Poss Perot. Whether they were completely true and authentic is an open question. Thus far, I have not heard from anyone challenging the facts.Mr Follett, you did an excellent job.
A1CH8N9XALGTAN	1	1	I am more convinced than ever that Barbara Tuchman was the greatest historian of the 20th century. I cannot think of anyone who can outmatch her.This is a most penetrating and incisive look at the political and social scene of Europe and America before the First World War. After reading this book the reader is inevitably led to the belief that a major war was forthcoming.My only negative comment are the words accompanying ther title 'APortrait of the World before the War' These words are inapproprite and misleading. True, Europe was the dominant world power and America getting to becomeone. But hardly anything was mentioned about China which was in steep decline and Japan emerging as a superpower.
A1CHF9VHRDTTO5	1	1	After all the 609 customer reviews, I doubt if anyone is going to pay any attention to this one. However, I can truly say that, I purchased abrush that costs around 45 dollars, by the time that I received it. This brush Tweezerman, I can tell do difference. The high price brush, issmaller and has a ivory colored plastic handle.This brush Tweezerman, does have a solid wood handle. I had rather have two of these, for one of the high priced one. This new brush holds lathervery well and is completly soft. It appears to be very well constructed, and made of the highest quality of materials. I believe that this brush isthree times the quality and feels better on your face than, the high priced NAME BRAND, which costs a third of the other. This brush presentsits self alot more pleasurable to use than the other. This a very reasonable price, for this high quality shaving brush that it is............
A1CHF9VHRDTTO5	0	0	I received this box of gloves today. The first one that I took out of the box had a hole in it. I tried to put on one of the gloves, the top partbroke off and snapped into. They are advertised to be tough, like for, working on cars etc., you can't put one on, for its breaking. I should haveread the other reviews, concerning them breaking. They are useless. I would send them back, except for the price, it would be more trouble than,its worth. Don't buy them, choose another brand or pay a little more for some that you can use...........................
A1CHF9VHRDTTO5	1	1	I am really pleased with this product. For the price, you can't purchase a better product for the purpose that it's intended for. Another thing that,I like about this product is, it is made in Germany. Most of all my shaving tools are made in Germany or USA. This holder looks exact as pictured,I have a tweezerman shaving brush and it fits this holder fine, that is why I purchased this holder, was for the tweezerman badger brush.I am not disputing the other reviewer's saying that, it does not fit his tweezerman brush. Sometimes every item is not exact. I am only speaking of,this holder and tweezerman brush that I have. This holder comes with a very good adhesive to put inside a cabinet or on the wall etc. Believe itor not, this is NOT a cheap piece junk from china. I do believe, it is well worth the price because of it's quality...............................
A1CHF9VHRDTTO5	0	0	This stuff is over rated. The only thing that I like about this product. is the fragrance. It appears that this productwill go a long way, doesn't take much. It dries out on your face very quickly. You have to keeping lathering with water,before you can finish shaving. If you use a straight razor, I highly DO NOT reccomend this product. It is a 5 starcontainer though...............
A1CHF9VHRDTTO5	1	0	I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift. She was very happy with this product. I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these. All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product. She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold. She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally. She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design. Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page.............
A1CHTTEURRMQJC	1	1	Lightweight and effective. Works very well with drills up to 14.4 volts. Larger drills do not balanced well. If you use your drill on a regular basis, you will like having this holster.
A1CHTTEURRMQJC	1	1	For the price, you get a good quality leather pouch. Exactly what it looks like, with plenty of pockets to store all those electrical tools.
A1CHTTEURRMQJC	1	1	For a very small price, this radio does all you would ask it to. If you like listening to AM radio (I like sports on radio) then this is an excellent cost effective piece of equipment to own. Nothing flashy, just sold performance.
A1CI2GY1UZK950	1	1	Shadow of the Colossus is one of my favorite video games of all time. However, several negative reviews here gave me pause: There are legitimate complaints to be made about the game, and whether you enjoy it or not depends a lot what you are looking for in a gaming experience.The controls are difficult at times. The Colossi vary from fun to fight to occasionally tedious and frustrating. And there is a LOT of riding a horse around an empty land trying to find the giants.I think that might be what finally separates lovers of this game from the, er, non-lovers. If you enjoy gaming primarily for non-stop action, this isn't the game for you. If on the other hand you can get wrapped up in the atmosphere of a unique game world, you will enjoy this.Personally, I found the empty landscape haunting and evocative; the very emptiness of it made me feel the protagonist's loneliness in his quest. I felt immersed in a unique world and really felt part of a mythic universe, and to me it became an emotional experience. I bet a lot of the game's other fans would say the same. But that isn't everyone's cup of tea.
A1CI2GY1UZK950	0	1	These picks work fine when it comes to strumming and picking the strings of a guitar, and that's pretty key. Still, I have to give these a two-star, "I don't like it" review based on aesthetics.The black ink used to print the label smudged like newsprint. I played for 10 or 15 minutes and looked - black ink smudged all over. Maybe I'm just a sweaty guy - okay, I'm definitely a sweaty guy. Still, the pick looks disgusting and left black ink on my thumb. Jeez.
A1CI7PTGIFKTVS	0	0	Ok, I bought the game 3 days ago and played it for about 5 minutes. I have been reading about it in magazines before it was released and was thinking that it would really be cool to have a superman game, and I couldn't have been more wrong.It took me about 5 minutes to get bored. You fly around to these giant robots and punch them and theyre dead. I thought that there would be somewhere you could go so that you could just fly around. There isnt that I found, I may be wrong though. The game starts with Clark and Lois walking down the street and apparently theyre married, those graphics arent all that great in the intro. I was just incredibly disappointed in the game, I mean superman can be killed???? Whats up with that? The flying is very limited, you go up down left or right and thats it, there is no way to loop or roll or anything like that. You just fly to where the HUD pointer is telling you to go, push a button to lock onto a target and punch or use your laser eyes or blow cold air. A complete waste of money, but if any of you out there jsut have to have a copy and don't want to blow too much money, contact me, mine can be purchased :)
A1CI7PTGIFKTVS	1	0	Interesting how those that preach tolerance for others, don't exactly practice what they &quot;preach&quot; Sorry if you are offended by the word preach, it is in no way endorsing or forcing my right wing christian beliefs on you. I just wanted to point out that &quot;A reader from New Hampshire&quot;, A reader from Washington DC&quot;, &quot;A Reader from Maryland&quot;, and Carolyn left some pretty nasty reviews. Turns out that because the name of George and Laura Bush is on the forward to the book, they won't even buy it. Of course there is the normal name calling and hate filled rhetoric that you would come to expect from left wing, intolerant socialist. You really should be ashamed for being incredibly petty and small minded, but then again, you were probably educated in government schools, so I guess we got what I paid for...
A1CI7PTGIFKTVS	1	0	A primary claim against Mr. Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans is that Mr. Kerry's first Purple Heart - awarded for action on Dec. 2, 1968 - did not involve the enemy and that Mr. Kerry's wounds that day were unintentionally self-inflicted.They charge that in the confusion involving unarmed, fleeing Viet Cong, Mr. Kerry fired a grenade, which detonated nearby and splattered his arm with hot metal.Mr. Kerry has claimed that he faced his "first intense combat" that day, returned fire, and received his "first combat related injury."A journal entry Mr. Kerry wrote Dec. 11, however, raises questions about what really happened nine days earlier."A cocky feeling of invincibility accompanied us up the Long Tau shipping channel because we hadn't been shot at yet, and Americans at war who haven't been shot at are allowed to be cocky," wrote Mr. Kerry, according the book "Tour of Duty" by friendly biographer Douglas Brinkley.If enemy fire was not involved in that or any other incident, according to the Military Order of the Purple Heart, no medal should be awarded.
A1CI7VT4I97L9S	1	1	got this sent to friend in the states to bring over to Scotland for me as he was lying here. Was imperative that it got to time to him to bring over. I arrived in plenty of time and he as able to bring over.Book in very good condition and great to have to add to my collection on the great famine in Ireland, which affected my family personally.Would Recommend this company
A1CI7VT4I97L9S	1	1	It is maybe of interest that this series was created in response to Simon Schama in "A History of Britain" which in fact was a "history of England" with any mention of Scotland, Wales or Ireland tagged on if it they had any connection to England. There were so many complaints to the BBC about this, that this series grew out of a response.Too long has Britian = England (no such thing as English Government, English Monarch (is there a Scottish one now??), English navy/army/airforce etc), now with our reclaiming ourselves as a nation and a people - maybe this crude stereotype is beginning to be broken - and this series does a great service to that. In some ways it is quite funny in that it turns the tables - that England gets a mention when it is in reference to what is happening in Scotland!!!
A1CIEN08GJ64TI	0	0	Be thankful if you watch this on a Showtime premium cable channel, because if you spend cash on renting it you would probably become angry. It is a low cost production with mediocre writing and a poor story line. But Lauren Holly is, as always, lovely to look at. Horror, sci fi, thriller ....who knows what category this flick belongs in. If you have an alternative, take it.
A1CIEN08GJ64TI	0	0	You get what you pay for. When a book comes in the mail for free, be suspicious. When it boldly proclaims on the cover that over 1 million copies in print, understand that it probably means that no one is stupid enough to pay for it. Sid Roth ought to be prosecuted for sham efforts to turn Jews into Christians. And for producing so much trash by wasting so many trees, meaning what he is harming the environment. The only good thing to say is that at least he is supporting the US Postal Service.
A1CIEN08GJ64TI	1	1	As a long-time film fan who has been critically watching films for some 60 years I would include this one in any list of the top 100 films ever made. After watching and thoroughly enjoying it I came to this conclusion: The film mounts so many serious and deep challenges to one's mental capabilities to constantly follow and understand what is happening that it is really like a visual IQ test. Those who do not like it and do not "get" it simply do not have the intelligence and quickness of mind to appreciate the film's complexity, creativity and convoluted story. If you give it five stars then you have a high IQ; be proud. Those giving it three or less stars simply do not have the brain power to love it. I can't wait to see it again and again.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	1	1	The worst thing about this DVD is that it's in letterbox format (4:3).The quality of the video is pretty good. It should look pretty good on a conventional TV, but it's okay even with a HD TV.The quality of the dancing is quite good as well.It's not the most recent production, so people who know ballet may feel that the costumes, lighting, and the set are not the most up to date style. But this would be a good DVD to keep in your ballet DVD collection.But I still like the ABT version of Le Corsaire better.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	1	1	This is a great DVD that has a pretty nice collection of pas de deuxs over the years. It's organized very easily, and the menu system is very easy to access and use.The quality of the video varies, but they all look better than average even on a HDTV set. It's formatted in 4:3 ratio.I think I will watch this DVD often since I can't really sit through a whole performance which takes about 2 hours.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	It's terribly boring. period.This DVD makes me fall asleep very easily.Too many interviews and the video quality is really bad.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	1	1	The video quality is superb.Dancing is just fine. I don't know why one of the reviewers said the dancing is mediocre. This is a top class production in high quality video and audio. It's beautiful.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	I had some high expectations after reading many positive reviews. But my kid had no interest after 5 minutes of viewing. Furthermore, the bad sound quality really bothered me so much that I had to throw away this DVD. For young children, good quality audio (music, verses, etc.) is a must, and this DVD doesn't deliver that. There are alot of noise from the start to finish. I think the songs are ok (not good), but it's hard to hear the exact words because of the noise problem. I think this DVD was a straight transfer from VHS.I think people should avoid this DVD.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	1	1	It's been a while since I've watched a nice movie like this one. 10 stars.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	My son (now 4) loves cars, so when I saw this bed frame, I thought this is it! Well, looks can fool you. I also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame, so I was confident that this was a MUST buy. But after using it for a while (1 year now), I am very disappointed. If I would buy another bed frame, this one would not be in my shopping list.What I and all my family don't like about this frame :1. The front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car, so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room, making people falter sometimes.2. Since it is made of plastic, it gets really cold, and it really feels terrible. I don't know why it is damn cold all the time.3. I had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one, because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling.4. So many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame. I have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings.5. I think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed. It is waste of space.6. My son was disappointed that the wheels don't spin. And I think he has a point, since this bed frame costs so much. My son now don't even think it's a cool thing. Well, he stopped liking the bed only after a few days.7. The head part of the bed is also plastic, and for some reason, your head can go under that plastic, because that head part comes over the mattress. It is quite annoying, and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame. And you can't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat. Dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame.8. Again, it is very very cold, and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard.This is a miserable bed, and I feel bad that I bought this horrible bed for my loving son. We are gonna sell it for 100 dollars (we hope) in the summer.The only reason for giving 2 stars is because, it is very solid.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	i watched their video and read their manual with recipes, but i only get bread that tastes bad. i used to use old Hitachi bread maker, and i wish they still make bread makers. this zojirushi bread machine is a big disappointment, and it has been in my kitchen cabinet for over 3 months now. I am very sad.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	It worked ok for about 2 years. Then one day, it just stopped working. Two years was just too short I think. So I give two stars. I won't buy this again.
A1CIN9NUGTTKOF	0	0	I bought this headphone thinking "What a nice design and color." I sweat while I ride my bike in the summer, and this seemed to be perfect for me as I like to use my iPod while riding. I bought it from Amazon.com in June, 2008, and until today, I really loved the design and I was satisfied with its loud sound.Well, what happened today? I tried to put it on to watch a movie on my laptop just now. But when I tried to put them on as usual, it felt like something sharp was either on the left side of the headphone or on my left ear. I tried to put on the headphone in several different angles, and I even tried to put it on with my glasses off, but I still felt something sharp thing poking on my ear. Then I examined the headphone (while connected to the Apple laptop) and realized that something had gone wrong on the left side. The electricity was so strong on the left side (that's where the wire to the sound source is located) and I realized that I was getting electricuted when I was trying to put on this headphone. I was so scared. And I was upset that a company like Sennheiser would make such a subpar product. After I bought the headphone in the U.S., I came back home to Japan, so I probably cannot even get a service for this product, let alone get a refund.I think this is a horrible product, and I felt I am obligated to let others know about it. Contrary to its looks, this headphone must have some design flaws. I really have not done anything harsh to it at all. I used it very very carefully. The headphone line was long enough that I never had any need to pull it with any kind of force. I never dropped it or stepped on it. I just connected and unconnected it to my iPod or to my laptop. That is all.I can't believe that I have to worry about getting eletricuted while using a headphone. Thank God it didn't impair me in anyway. I am upset that such a stupid thing could happen. I am over 40 years old, and this is the first time ever in my life that I am upset over a pair of headphones.I will NEVER buy Sennheiser products again. (By the way this is the 2nd Sennheiser headphone I bought)
A1CISXP2W97VPJ	1	1	It's a great book of magic - well written. I love that you can rent it from the kindle store like a library.
A1CISXP2W97VPJ	0	0	We ordered this item after seeing a lot of positive reviews and were VERY disappointed. It is poorly constructed, feels cheap, and the scissor design is not well executed in that the rake and scoop do not line up so it does NOT close - making it impossible to actually pick up the dog mess. We returned it immediately and ordered something a little more expensive and of better quality. I do not recommend this product.
A1CISXP2W97VPJ	1	1	Our puppy loves these. They are a good size and the different kinds of chews in it keep him interested. His favorite is the poultry flavored one - we haven't given him the edible bacon flavored yet, but he's smelled it and went kind of bonkers :) The puppy takes them everywhere - to bed, outside, in the car. They are great for chewing. It would be nice if they were slightly fatter, but that's because he likes to chew on larger things (arms, for example). Overall, a great product/kit for puppies - with great variety that keeps them interested!
A1CISXP2W97VPJ	1	1	This is a great clicker. Having never clicker trained a dog before, I love this. It comes with instructions on how to condition your dog to the clicker and then also tells you how to teach him to sit and come when called, giving instructions that are easily applied to other things you want to train your dog to do. I definitely recommend this product. In 5 sessions (less than 15 minutes) and 2.5 days, our puppy is conditioned to the clicker and starting to sit on command.
A1CJB1TFIEYJ51	0	0	Technically it does what it says, but when it said it was lighted and showed the light[s] went all the way around I was expecting much more illumination. The amount of light given off is about the same as the &lt;1 watt covered led nightlights I buy for saving electricity so I can navigate my home at night without having to turn on the main lights. Does it light? Yes? Is it enough for makeup, only in a well lit room to start with.
A1CJB1TFIEYJ51	1	1	It is a great book and has all the scenes they keep cutting out of movies to keep them in the time constraints.
A1CJMZ49E2TVIJ	1	1	Michael J. Fox is at his best in this comedy/scareflick/mystery. All of the actors did a great job in this movie, I was surprised at how much I loved it. I bought it on VHS then DVD and I'll probably buy the blu ray as well.
A1CJMZ49E2TVIJ	0	0	If they were seeking to completely destroy the Ghost Rider Film Franchise they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. I saw the first movie and loved it, but it doesn't count here since they completely discounted it for the sequel. With no decent story and some of the worst acting I have ever seen Nicolas Cage do this movie falls flat on it's face. From the moment it starts you are wishing it was over. I gave it one star and that was to much.
A1CJSQT165NFBE	0	1	My goodness... all these five star reviews really awe me... I've been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars. Sonic Adventure one was very fun game to play, but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed. Those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title. I didn't give Sonic Adventure 2 a 1 star review because many people,including my own brother enjoyed this game. It also had a decent following.On a personal level however I feel they kept all the flaws from the original game, took out all the previous positive changes, and slapped a title on it. I was very disappointed. If you own the dreamcast I'd recommend getting the original before this one.
A1CJSQT165NFBE	1	0	Look at the other reviews not gonna waste your time. Get it! If you have played the older zelda's and didn't like em don't! If you don't like the newer titles still worth a look. this one Sh**s on all of em
A1CJSQT165NFBE	1	1	Jaws is a very old school nes game which I find to be very entertaining. If you do not like nes games...duh don't buy it. If you do I'd argue this is one of the better games to have for the system. You start on a boat and the game has somewhat of an old school -- EXTREMELY BASIC -- rpg element. after a while of moving your boat Jaws fin will hit your boat putting you in a 2d fighting screen. Sorta like Zelda 2 but in no way am I comparing them, I feel this works for Jaws and not Zelda. NOW IS YOUR CHANCE to hurt jaws with your cannons.It is inevitable, eventually Jaws will hit your boat and you will be swimming, dodging, and shooting at different fish fighting for your life.Eventually the screen will clear. After this you will return to the previous screen in your boat right where you left off. Repeat Above.I have not defeated Jaws ( He had one Freakin hit point left!!!) yet so I dunno know what happens the first time you kill him.If for some reason I only have a limited time to game this has always been a good quick fix before work or something. Buy but don't break your wallet over it!
A1CJSQT165NFBE	1	1	This is a puzzle game that consists of building pieces of land to hold and maintain the water level that is thrown at your building grid.The bombs yes at times are annoying but I feel they are needed to balance out the difficulty. If you like action games and hate puzzle games... duh look elsewhere. If you are a tetris snob where nothing compares, still look elsewhere. If you enjoy puzzle games such as tetris, bust a move, and are willing to try something new I was not disappointed. Wouldn't break my wallet on this game but is perfect for when I only have a little time to play.
A1CJSQT165NFBE	1	1	Star Fox Command is a very stunning looking game especially considering the size of it's Cartridge and the limited power on the ds-lite (which is what I'm Using). The game -- though much smaller -- easily compares to Star Fox 64. Backgrounds are clear and realistic enough. For example different weathers, such as clear or cloudy skies.The controls for this game is probably the most controversial part of this game. Personally I like the touch screen. Yes it's different from the joystick but with a little getting used to I do not feel it is worst than one. On the 64 yes the joystick was smooth... at first! I honestly feel I have gone through more 64 controllers than socks.I'm not even that aggressive of a player. When the joystick on the pad was bad... I felt it took the controls of Starfox 64 right with it. No waiting for new 64 controllers here! Also, even though the snes one was good, I put up with the control pad because I didn't know any differently at the time, joysticks hadn't been made on Nintendo's yet. On that note THANK YOU Nintendo for not making us use the control pad! As for the Game Cube Star Fox fighter, couldn't tell you. Didn't get around to it because of some certain HORRIBLE action adventure game involving fox...So maybe the controls on the GameCube are better but who cares, Game Cubes did horrible in the previous console wars anyways.Now I feel there is a couple of changes -- not flaws -- that didn't ruin it for me, but I could see really bothering others. The first thing is the sound. The voices during fight scenes is gibberish so reading is a must.If you've played Animal Crossing you know what I'm talking about. On their defense though they really packed ALOT of Game in one VERY TINY cartridge. Real voices probably would not have fit or would have been a major waste of room. Another is if you are really a fan or follower I think one of the familiar faces is missing. Not sure which one though, I don't follow that closely. However, something that I would have dropped a 1/2 of a star for --if I could-- is the strategic map planning before a battle. Its not that this ruined the game for me and for sure raised the difficulty level, I could just see some people REALLY not caring for this part because of how mandatory,confusing, and constant this mode is. You do it before every fight.Overall not the best but very good game. This makes a nice new Addition to the Star Fox Library.
A1CJSQT165NFBE	1	1	Dreamcast was a system I obtained In 2000 as a Christmas gift. I wanted a Ps2 and acted like any slightly spoiled child would when I opened it. Ten years later I still have one and enjoyed it very much. In no way am I saying that Ps2 didn't blow this console out of the water however ten years later I still play it.My first dreamcast I did absolutely no up keep to it but sadly a hazed friend of mine belly uped my first off of a counter by snagging the controller I lazily left out.Luckily I was able to replace it new for 75$.Over that ten years everything worked great on my first except for some reason Shenmue did not like to be read. I believe that meant the eye was going out or my dreamcast just did not like that particular disk(s).Some games on a disk sometimes didn't work on other dreamcasts. If that happens you need to repurchase the same game and usually the other disk would work.For some reasons some disks wouldn't work on some dreamcasts. This was/is uncommon but it happens.My new one runs like new.Every game boots right up.The design IMO is attractive but dirties to easily.Fan power seems a little weak, but vacuuming the vents every few weeks or so really helps mine -- do at own risk. Its a little brick with a mediocre hardware system.Its easily just as loud as an xbox 360 when disks are read. Has a cd player option that is attractive when used alright sound put out.The system utilizes its 4 controller slots a lot of the time to the max.This is a fun party game system. Roommates really helped with The use of this system.Games such as: DOA,Wetrix,Le mans,Crazy taxi 1(2),Power stone 1(2),soul caliber,and many others were fun games to play with four people sometimes two right next to you.Other multiplayers still had home multi player but also went online.Games Like bomberman online,PsO,chu chu rocket were a hit online for a short period. Understand that this is the first system to Fully push online play -- ok people say saturn did and in fact yes their right but if anyone had played it they would probably agree with me that it was a joke.If you've never played online for dreamcast lets say Compared to Ps3, dreamcast would make you laugh. If you are younger and started next gen you may not understand why I even put up with it.Understand even when I played PsO online As slow as dial up was that I put up with it because this was a first.This was like Black ops of 2000.Online play is no longer supported through Sega on dreamcast. I believe if you are smart enough some people still play games like quake 3 online with their dreamcast,somehow.The Next thing that is neat about the dreamcast is their games that were individually selected for that system. Games such as D2,Project Justice,Samba de Amigo(WITH MIRACHAS),And Seaman(With Mic), give you huge bragging rights. Samba di Amigo,W/ Mirachas easily could fetch 150$.Some of these games are hard to find cheap or even at all.With the Accessories it gets even more expensive.Though the listed genres I put were Strong -- a lot side scrollers and 2d fighters--Rpg is where it really took a hit.Yes Skies of Arcadia was perfection,Shenmue rocked,and PsO was decent but thats about it...Sad.Fps were scarce too. Soldier of fortune is the only one I'd really recommend now that quake 3 isn't online.I love my dreamcast and play it regularly however A lot of the reason I enjoy it so much is because during my peak of gaming this is the system I had. If you missed the dreamcast growing up think twice and try it before you buy. Some of the happiest times were playing games like Nfl 2k1 when they came out or if a childhood friend came to visit.If you jump from next gen into dreamcast without experiencing it as when it was the NEW thing, your content with the console may not be as much as some reviewers will say.You kind of had to experience it IMO to fully enjoy it.
A1CK1T7JS5FW0Y	1	1	I received it in good condition. I Love to give this book as a gift. It is always appreciated even when people don't know the book, they say it's a life changer after reading.
A1CK1T7JS5FW0Y	0	0	I give Torah commentaries as Bar/Bat Mitzvah Books. It looks as though the publisher has cheapened down this most important book. Compared to the one I use, the cover is not as rich looking. The inside paper is not as nice. The corners were bent from the plastic it was sealed in. The price is much less than in a store but I'd rather pay the price and get a better quality. I was not proud to give this gift but didn't have time to return it. I will investigate to see if it is the same edition everywhere and if so will buy the Stone edition.
A1CK1T7JS5FW0Y	1	1	Brenda Abrams is a well respected attorney. She had written the books on the divorce lawsof the State of Florida. The books are the &#34;go to&#34; books for other lawyers. This book is written forThe lay person. It's a good book to read before retaining a lawyer. It's better to go in armedWith knowledge
A1CK6BUFGNDFXY	1	1	I enjoyed this event alot and I recommend it. My personal oppinion is that it's between a 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 star product. Main event was outstanding.
A1CK6BUFGNDFXY	0	0	I initially had the impression that this book would be explaining different growth and development theories from different cultures IN DEPTH(since thats implied in the books description), but this is not the case. Instead the author basically gives some exercises, massage techniques, and some recommended nurtional supplements that have been rooted in different cultures; however, he does not provide any scientific evidence supporting alot of what he says, yet he continuously refers to scientific studies. Personally, I believe that the majority of what the author says is so, but when he is talking about specific scientific studies, it is best to list those studies he is referring to.Another thing the author does is provide a list of "statements" in BOLD LETTERING at the very end of each chapter, and there happen to be 15 different chapters. One of these statements is basically a disclaimer, and he or she is basically saying that the author "does not warrant or assume any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, correctness, or usefulness of any information or products discussed or disclosed in this book". This is just one of the "statements" listed at the end of every chapter, basically working as a disclaimer, but there are quite a few more. And one things for sure, the author isn't lying when he says he/she shouldn't be responsible for the correctness or completeness of the information.There are 183 pages of actual reading in this book, and the rest of the pages are just basically references and the index. I believe there is AT LEAST ONE spelling, punctuation, or grammatical error on every single page of the main book, however, there may be a few pages that do not contain a single error, but the majority of these pages have SEVERAL ERRORS. I don't understand why all of these small errors wouldn't have been edited out, nor do I understand why they are so abundant. But one things for sure; these errors make reading this book a little complicated in many areas.Also, I still don't know exactly who or what "Yeii Lifestyle" is, nor do I know who the author of this particular book is, since the author of the book is not revealed(to the best of my knowledge). I'm nearly positive the author isn't "Yeii Lifestyle", since the author recommends using Yeii meditation, which seems to be some form of discipline. There is no "about the author section", or anything similar.Another major problem with this book is the writer's problem with repeating himself over and over again, EXACTLY WORD FOR WORD. In the earlier chapters of the book, I only caught the author saying PRECISELY what he said in a previous chapter in the chapter that I was reading currently, however. Near the middle of the book, there will be an overall theme to each chapter with a 1 page explanation at the beginning. The following pages will contain the exact same information, EXACTLY word for word, that the previous chapter had contained. This process continues until the final chapter of the book.I personally paid over 27 dollars for this book, and the listed price on the price tag for this book is 47 dollars, which is just crazy. Alot of the information in this book is pretty basic, but there is definetly some useful information. The biggest thing missing, as I mentioned earlier, are the references to what exactly the author is talking about. You won't find this book at your library and you probably won't find it at your bookstore, which leaves you the only option of spending almost 28 dollars buying this book. Although there is some useful information in the text, I cannot recommend spending money on this book since the ratio of pro's to con's is dramatically imbalanced; the con's weighing out the pro's on a big time level.
A1CK6BUFGNDFXY	1	1	Many times after reading a book you aren't going to absorb very much at all, however. I can honestly say that there were a few very important things that I was able to learn as well as absorb from this book, that I actually carry with me to this day. I highly recommend it and it's at an excellent price as well.
A1CK6BUFGNDFXY	0	0	I've seen almost all of the UFC events, and I assure you that this is one of the worst ones available on DVD. The superfight between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie did not live up to the hype even in the slightest, and it was mostly just Ken Shamrock laying on top of Royce Gracie in a defensive Jiu-Jitsu posture for about 35 minutes. It was one of the top 3 worst fights I've personally been exposed to in the UFC, and the other fights(with the exception of just a couple) in this event were not that impressive at all. And the main event consisting of Dan Severn winning the championship, also, was not that impressive at all.I do not recommend spending even 4-5 dollars on this product, and I recommend purchasing UFC 6 instead, which is the debut of "Tank" Abbot.
A1CK6BUFGNDFXY	1	1	I enjoyed this event pretty much from start to finish, and I highly recommend it. All of the pre-fight interviews with the individual fighters are included.
A1CK8KZKOMMFBU	1	1	Steve Hamaker really does justice to Jeff Smith's line work. I picked up the first volume with hesitation, expecting the color to diminish the impact of the original artwork, but I was happy to see that it actually brought it to life more in certain panels. Since this epic story has been pegged as the definitive &#34;children's comic book&#34; that every kid should read, I would think the kids might be more likely to appreciate the colored version than the black and white original prints. Kids just like colorful things. However, for adult fans of the original Bone, this is also a wonderful way to revisit this amazing epic story again. I'm rereading these books for the third time now, and it's refreshing to see them in a new coloful light.
A1CK8KZKOMMFBU	1	0	I was very interested in this film for a few different reasons. The first being that it's based on a true story, which, aside from a few minor unique plot points, felt like any other heist story (fictional or not). The second being the relationship between the two main characters, which felt awkward and distant at best, and forced into the plot as vague subtext at it's worst. The irony in that is that it's a main subject of the film. There is no reason to handle it so awkwardly. The third reason I wanted to see the film is that it's the first same-sex "mobster" flick I've ever heard of. I felt it would be interesting to see the contrast of a same-sex duo against the stereotypical machismo of the mobster world, but it wasn't that interesting at all. The only conflict in that regard was "The Twins" being called the "f-word" in a couple scenes, which was portrayed mostly as a kind of brotherly hazing as opposed to being dramatically offensive or hurtful in any way.Aside from those points, overall the film was clumsy. There were a few continuity jumps that confused me, and, even though I backed it up to see if I missed a transition or something, it was just simply cut in a poor manor at those points. The acting was okay, nothing spectacular. The characters were unpredictable (in a bad way). There were many scenes that felt unrehearsed, awkward and unconvincing, or just simply unnecessarily vague and convoluted.Despite all this, it was different enough to enjoy it, and I think I would watch it again. There were actually a couple parts where I felt my tear ducts filling up, so the film did manage to invoke some level of emotion in me. That's always a good sign I suppose. I give it a 4 out of 5. It dares to blend a taboo(ish) same-sex love story with a cliche Heist plot... and only marginally succeeds at both; however, there is something unique about this film that made it feel fresh and enjoyable.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	1	1	PRO'SThe Baby Bjorn was wonderfully easy to use.It is easy to wash in the machine.Padded straps.Easy to put on/off alone.Comfortable while baby was under 18lb.Baby LOVED LOVED LOVED looking out.CON'SBaby is in front of you so housework is more difficult, therefore I never carried him around the house.I have bought an Ergo carrier. For baby No. 2 I will use the baby bjorn until too heavy and will then transfer into Ergo (even tho Ergo has an infant insert). I am happy enough with the Bjorn to use it instead of buying the infant insert for the Ergo. While doing housework I plan to carry Baby No. 2 in a Mei Tai on my back.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	0	0	Nice, understated colour. A good size on the outside. However, it is heavy and bulky before you even put anything into it. The changing pad is attached to the bag which is very awkward. There are not enough little compartments for small things. There are not enough little compartments on the outside of the bag for things like cloths that you need to grab quickly.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	0	1	This book made me realize there was a sleep-eat-play cycle going on with my baby so it gets one star. This book is about putting your baby on a strict by-the-clock schedule. Forget about your baby's cues, feed according to the clock. I recommend the 'No-cry Sleep Solution' and any of the Dr. Sears books. I would never recommend this book to anyone as it does not fit with my style of parenting which is to follow the newborn's cues. What is the point of having the ability to cry (ie communicate) if your parent ignores you!
A1CKL54CPH0VB	1	1	PRO's- My toddler likes seeing the photo's. This is so much better than drawings. He points to the picture of the girl going down the slide and chatters away about it for a little while, ditto for the photo under it of the boy drawing. He points out the Mum, Dad, Baby.- It shows a baby being breastfed and bottle fed and the facing page shows a boy eating an icecream cone. I use those pages to show my toddler that the baby breastfeeds and the big boy eats yummy icecream. I wish the boy was sitting at a table eating something nutritious so I could get a bit more milage out of that. I don't want to emphasize the icecream too much! I ignore the bottle feeding photo because I do like my toddler to drink from a sippy cup when I don't feel like hovering and mopping up spills.- As a positive point in the book i just want to highlight again that there is a photo of a baby breastfeeding.- Last page shows family walking and baby is in Baby Bjorn style carrier rather than stroller- Diverse races of families shownCON's- Very dated photo's. My library copy does not have a publication date but it has to be from the 70's. So, the clothing is 70's, I can get over that. But it would be nice to have the photo of the baby sleeping on his back without a stuffed animal in the crib!- Three or four double page spreads are devoted to how the arrival of the new baby can make the toddler/child feel left out. I think that is too many photo's of an unhappy child or a child being ignored while the baby is on Mum's lap.I am going to buy this book, having found it by chance in the library.I'm also going to look for other Mister Rogers books. I saw one on potty learning and I would love for there to be a book like this to explain weaning to a toddler.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	0	0	I had a Fisher-Price version on these playmats which I gave 5 stars.http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Songs-Smiles-Discovery-Gym/dp/B000OONJBO/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleIt was really great and colorful and came with a heap of hanging toys and a mirrored, music-playing dog.After lending it to a friend and getting it back bent out of shape my hubby bought this one as a last minute xmas gift for our Baby #2. It was the only one in the store he had ducked into. It only has 3 hanging toys. Every other similar playmat has heaps of toys and most have music and lights as well. My main dislike of this one is that the arches are quite low, lower than the Fisher-Price one, so it seems like the toys are right in Baby's face. Other than those deficiencies, the mat is reasonably padded and the material is soft, not silky but soft enough. I would not recommend this to anyone but I do recommend the Fisher-Price one.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	1	1	This is a nice little story. The story is ridiculous- which is why my toddler/almost pre-schooler and I love it. And the language is not baby-ish, it is a proper book. This is a book that will span many years of reading.Storyline is that a tiger came over and ate and drank everything in the house so when Father got home from work there was nothing for dinner. So he suggests going out to a cafe for dinner.I liked this book so much I have looked up other books by this author that i plan to buy. I will also give this book as a gift.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	1	1	The version of the game I have differs from the product description in that:- It has no music (Thank Goodness! Hooray! Thank-You, Thank-You, Thank-You!)- The fish are a solid colour where this picture shows they have white jaws.- It very inconveniently uses one c size battery rather than two AA batteries.We find this game quite fun. I actually looked for it on Amazon right now to buy it as a gift because my son received it as an xmas gift. I was surprised to see it was only $6.Educational? - I guess this helps kids improve co-ordination, concentration and colour recognition.Durability? - Well, I would not rate this as particularly durable because it is just a plastic, battery operated toy that doesn't allow for all that much imaginative play. My son has pulled the eyes off several fish because they are just stickers. However, it doesn't feel so flimsy that I hesitate to give it as a gift.How it works: This game has a heap of little plastic fish travelling in a circle with their mouths opening and closing. Their teeth are sharp enough to hurt a little if you were inclined to stick one on your finger and clamp it shut. All players use a plastic 'fishing rod' with a 'hook' to catch as many fish as possible. The hook stays in the fish's mouth when it closes so you can lift up the fish. I prefer this over a magnet system. I like how it is not just a matter of lifting up a fish but also a challenge to hook the fish when it's mouth is open.What makes this game so good is that it is reasonably challenging for an adult so your kid can see you miss, and it is reasonably do-able for a kid. My 2 1/2yo has no trouble catching the fish.The opening and closing of the plastic fish mouths makes an awful racket. If you are all sitting together to play the game you don't really realise how noisy it is, but one person could not watch TV or dance to a CD if someone else is playing this game in the same room. I was surprised to see whatever previous version the product description is for had music because you would either never hear it or it would be VERY loud. And a short piece of music played over and over and over for the time it takes a toddle/pre-schooler to hook all the fish would drive me mad! :-)Ultimately, for the price, you are getting a pretty cool game. I'm sure someone could make a more expensive version that is quieter and has the fish opening and closing their mouths a little more spaced apart rather than the two points in the game where they all open their mouths and the two points where they all have their mouths closed. (You end up turning the game around so the fish open in front of your kid and close in front of you). Also, a more convenient battery size and painted or moulded eyes would be nice for a pricier model. And, of course, I would pay quite a lot more for a Made in the USA version or a model made of recycled-recyclable plastic or a biodegradable material.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	1	1	I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)
A1CKL54CPH0VB	0	0	The more I have seen of this movie the less I like it. My 3.5yr old likes it so I have seen it, or parts of it, quite a few times recently.The graphics are very good, with amazing attention to details. In some cases it is absolutely brilliant with the reflections or expressions being very accurate or the body movements as the kids run along a squashy conveyor belt. But a scene where hot chocolate it being handed out and, more importantly, Santa are pretty poorly illustrated. The elves also look awful. The graphics is the reason for adding 2 stars. I have deducted stars for:-The storyline is all about a boy who has started to doubt the existence of Santa and boards a magical train to the North Pole to see him. There is nothing about kindness or love or any of the real messages of xmas, it is all about presents and proving Santa exists.-The train conductor is unneccesarily stern and intimidating.-All the employees are incompetent, the train drivers who break and lose parts, lose control of the train and endanger the passengers, the elves who fail to lift the sack of presents high enough and nearly kill someone.-What is with the spooky hobo/angel? He is mean and sarcastic but then helpful. But the way he gets hit by a low bridge and shatters into thousands of shards of ice is just scary for kids.-There is just a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Why is the train so long when there is only one carriage of kids, one of toys and presumably one of hot chocolate servers? When they stop to pick up the last boy another boy comments on that being strange because he thought Hero Boy was the last pick up. How does he know who is last? What is the significance of this last minute addition? Nothing, as it turns out. Once at the North Pole the conductor asks all the kids to line up in two rows, odd birthdates on one side, evens on the other or some such. Why? If believing in Santa is so important why are such a small group of kids chosen to see him? When the main girl character loses her ticket the conductor takes her away, out the back carriage to walk across the train roof to the front and puts her in chanrge of driving th train while the driver changes a lightbulb. Why? And why is it when she is removed from the kids' carriage there is discussion and panic about her being thrown off the train for not having a ticket? The Boy From The Poor Neighbourhood has never received a present and understandably does not believe in Santa so why bring him to show him Santa is real and has, what, just chosen to never give him a present? Why do they all keep walking around on top of a moving train in a blizzard in only PJs and slippers? I wear a down filled coat anytime it is below 50F/10C even if sunny!-The whole movie just seems to be building up suspense and questions that go unfulfilled. Near the end the conductor calls out something to Hero Boy who doesn't hear him and replies "What?" so the conductor calls out louder "Merry Christmas!". But there is the uneccessary suspense that the conductor has called out something significant and Hero Boy might miss the message.
A1CKL54CPH0VB	0	1	I have found this mixer works well for mixing and is easy to clean but I have to replace it because it makes the batter fly out of the bowl. When mixing I MUST cover the mixer and bowl with a towel or else I have a fair amount of clean-up. I hold it very steady and straight to minimise the mess. My 4yo is ready to help with baking but the mess this mixer makes means it is impossible for me to let him mix because the batter get EVERYWHERE!I have had this for a couple of years and have finally gotten sick of it. It was comfy to hold and seemed sturdy enough but I do NOT recommend this because of the spattering of the batter.
A1CKQ2V5MPKSXI	1	1	This is a fun book. Gaiman and Pratchett make Armageddon look like a really good time. I was particularly impressed by their Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse (did I spell that right?). Bedecked in red leather, their War makes Xena pale by comparison.I gave a copy to a friend as a going-away gift. He's a religious man, but he enjoyed it immensely.Enjoy!
A1CKQ2V5MPKSXI	1	1	Goanna were probably the best of the Aussie Invasion that hit the US back in the early '80's. I bought an audio cassette of Spirit of Place in 1982 and it quickly became my favorite tape ever. There aren't any songs on this cd, tape, whatever. They are, instead, well-crafted, intense stories set to music. If you like the works of Harry Chapin, or Springsteen's &quot;Nebraska,&quot; you might want to give Spirit of Place a moment of your time. You won't regret it!
A1CKQ2V5MPKSXI	1	1	Gordon is easily the best (so far, anyway) Barenaked Ladies cd. You just can't help but smile and tap your toes when you listen to songs like I Love You, and If I Had $1,000,000.

A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I returned to Geek Love after having first read it in the 90's. After two decades I can say without hesitation that this is a book that will stick with you, and that you will remember long after you read it. For something to have that effect on you as a reader is a beautiful thing, and very rare. It is a fantastic story told incredibly well, and deals with subject matter that pleasant society probably won't be comfortable with.The book chronicles the lives of the Binewski family and their carnival, focusing mostly on the relationships between Arturo (Aqua Man), his sister Olympia, and Olympia's daughter Miranda. It is not a book for the faint of heart or those with a gentle stomach. Geek Love is about carnival freaks, bred that way by their mother and father who believe that the more twisted they are by deformity the more precious and beautiful their very being. The book makes some poignant statements about being different and the unique outlook it can give you on life. It also points out the subjectivity of beauty and its downfalls.Every character in the book is well defined and brought to the forefront, and each character has a story to tell that is uniquely their own. From Horst the cat man to Doctor P and Mary Lick, there isn't a single character that doesn't shine in this novel. It is hard to review this book without revealing some of the plot, which shouldn't be done as it could spoil Geek Love for those who haven't read it. The story involves the carnival heavily, familial love, sacrifice, cults, incest, and views of so called "norms" toward the geeks.It is at every moment inspiring and heartbreaking, with so much to take away from the book that you think back on it frequently to reassess your opinion. Is Arturo merely a pompous self-absorbed jerk or is he terrified of being left alone and unloved? Do Al and Lil really not understand how hard they have made the lives of their children, are they blind to the dynamics of their family or is it too hard for them to look at as parents? was the Chick simple for all his brilliance or just too young to understand the ramifications of his actions and inaction? How can a person like Mrs. Lick not understand that she is acting out of her own pain while she "liberates" the beautiful?This is not to say that Geek Love doesn't end well, the conclusion of the book is as beautiful and simple as its beginning. It is perhaps the greatest testament to this novel that you are left with these moral questions, it isn't often that a piece of fiction will make you think so deeply on its subject matter and on the morality of the concepts it lays out.I wouldn't suggest this book to many of my friends for the simple fact that I don't believe they could get through Geek Love without hurling it across the room. It is offensive, but not purposefully so, it's the kind of book that shoves the world of freaks in your face and makes you feel like one. If for that reason alone it should be read by as many people as possible, it's a timeless piece of literature and worthy of being on the shelves of any reader who can take a moment to open their mind to a reality different from their own.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	There's nothing like dosing your aquarium with bright blue liquid that reminds you of windshield wiper cleaner. Coral-vite claims to be a product that provides the trace elements to your tank that coral really need to display their best colors, grow, and maintain good health. It does, but it doesn't do it better than other products and in the long run requires more work than alternatives that provide results just as good and in some cases better.Using a block of Formula 28 (not listed on Amazon but in nearly every aquarium store in the States) will provide all the base nutrients in Coral-vite and it dissolves as needed in the tank. Simply drop in a block of the white chalk like substance and watch it fizz like an alkaseltzer in the water, slowly disappearing over the next week depending on your tanks specific needs. This is a huge boon; unlike Coral-vite which is a liquid dose, you can't overdo it with Formula 28.Target feeding your coral with a littleLiquid Life Cyclop-eeze Whole Freeze-Driedand a phytoplankton dose (such as those made by Kent Marine) with some meaty bits of your coral: oyster eggs, krill, et cetera will provide even better results than Coral-vite in regard to color and growth rate.While this isn't a bad product, there are much better when it comes to making sure your coral have all their trace nutrients and minerals and it won't provide better growth. In the end it's not going to destroy your tank, and it comes with very helpful directions on the back of the container that we should all be familiar with in handling the life in our aquarium. I would suggest this for a cheap trick, but it won't serve your longterm needs and can actually be very worrying for a person new to saltwater reefkeeping, it's much easier to use too much and if you don't have the right tests you may not know whether you're actually hurting or helping your tank chemistry.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	Drive is a great introduction to Bic Runga, if you have only heard her song "Sway" you will find that you have been missing out. She has a fantastic vocal range and her lyrics are often refreshingly bright and cheery before drifting into something deeper.There is nothing particularly amazing about this album by Bic Runga, it is very much "pop". However it serves as a great diving board to her other albums:Beautiful CollisionandBirdswhich show far more of her talent and skill as a singer/songwriter/musician.In Drive you will find something that is signature to Bic Runga as an artist, her ability to go from a breathless dreamy sort of sound to something suddenly passionate that reverberates through the air from your speakers. It is always a well placed transition and you will find it far more evident in her later albums that can border on a very lounge singer/blues aspect.The lyrics of Bic Runga are often like her music, at times they are simple and catchy, at other moments you can truly enjoy the interesting way she strings words together in her songs.This is the sort of music you can go back to over and over, it's not offensively loud, particularly stuck in a single genre, or completely similar. It's good for the ears on a long drive, picking up the house, or singing in the shower. If you do like this album I'd highly suggest you move forward to her other albums where you may find even more to enjoy and appreciate.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	There is something particularly pleasant about coming back to an artist years later and finding that while their work has evolved it is still recognizable. I will admit that I was not aware Primus was still making music until I happened to need to replace one of my CD's (Frizzle Fry). Upon seeing Pork Soda I had a compulsion to purchase it, perhaps to relive the nostalgia of when I had seen them in concert many years ago.I was pleasantly surprised. The strong reliance on bass was still a huge part of the music, the fun, whimsical; almost carnival aspect of the songs was intact. On top of this the lyrics has improved substantially and yet still had the feel of Primus, which was essential to my enjoyment.There should be huge praise for any band that has the longevity of Primus that still manages to maintain their originality and keep true to their "roots" so to speak. Primus probably isn't a band for everyone, or perhaps most people, for those that haven't heard their sound before I am not sure what to compare it to in order to give you a jumping off point. It is at once rough and refined, with complicated and yet catchy lyrics. It is worth an album worth giving a chance if you're new to the band; if you're like me and haven't heard Primus in years it will not only bring back great memories of times gone by but remain familiar enough that you're already prepared to start memorizing the lyrics.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	0	***This review is chock full of delicious spoilers***I watched this film with a friend and my house turned into something akin to Mystery Science Theatre 2000. When it was over, we both sat silently watching the credits. I asked him what he thought and he said he wasn't sure; I was at a loss for words. Neither of us was particularly sure what to make of this movie right away, it was just so incredibly off the wall as to be ridiculous. Not the fun sort of ridiculous that lives on the fringe of creepy, the kind of ridiculous you get when you see a steampunk automaton opera with a chick impaled with feathers to look like an angel.The story revolves around a girl who sleeps almost her entire life due to a strange disorder, and is in a hospital on the wing for mental patients being cared for quite well even though she has no family and the hospital looks like it is falling apart. Creepily (though not seemingly intentionally) everyone wants to have sex with her, which is so far from appropriate that could have been the actual horror in the film. The doctor, the art student, the crazy and obsessive while also magical serial killer...everyone apparently thinks it's just A-O.K. to want to make love with a comatose woman. I mean, isn't that just grand? It's also presented as totally fine, even understandable, I mean someone is putting makeup on her so Sleeping Beauty must want this sort of attention.When she does wake up, she's like an infant because of her stunted understanding of the world around her. Yet suddenly she is as mature as an adult (conveniently when it comes time for her to be sexualized), her lilting haphazard speech becomes regular, and we can almost believe this is an affliction that comes and goes rather infrequently instead of how it was originally presented. Perhaps the director realized that presenting a person with a serious medical affliction and developmental delays due to it as wanting sex as being far too repulsive and morally repugnant. Or maybe a producer did. It's dreck.Our serial killer is supposedly a hypnotist that also possesses a serious psychic ability to invade dreams along with being obsessed with Sleeping Beauty and killing lots and lots of people. He's so dangerous that they keep him locked in a room restrained with chains so he can't move, but they have one haphazard security guard and allow orderlies to go into the room unattended. He was / is a bibliophile with a store that while shut down and barely boarded up after his capture is completely intact, if only mildly dusty. After all, nobody would want to break into it, burn it down, vandalize it, steal memorabilia, or otherwise.Our student / record store clerk has a dead end life with a girlfriend who conveniently leaves him just before he meets Sleeping Beauty. He is an utter and complete idiot, with no common sense, and no understanding of the world. This shouldn't be hard to swallow considering everyone in the film suffers from this disorder. He manages to kidnap Sleeping Beauty (ala "rescue") from the hospital because she's going to be signed off to another facility to be used as a test subject by a doctor that somehow still has a license to practice medicine! Then she kills some people under magical psychic dream control and the police (one of whom she kills) are just confused as all get out by the entire ordeal. I mean, who would think to check the other apartments on the hall when someone is killed? Who would hear the screaming and torture that obviously took place during the murder in a crowded building? Everyone must have been having one heck of a party.Then we climax with a weird steampunk automaton opera death scene where the evil plans of serial killer psychic hypnotist book lover are revealed and some stuff happens and the movie ends in some fuzzy love place that makes you go: "Huh?" Especially since horribly afflicted patient girl can (it would seem) control her disorder which makes you wonder why she wanted to suffer so much for her entire life.Throughout this little adventure we're bombarded by terrible visual effects of this dream world. Then we find our evil dreamscape cleansed and happiness ever after. The only redeeming factors of this movie are the music which is generally palatable and the fact you can spend the entire time making fun of this movie and it never gets boring. From hackneyed characters and plastic acting to poor effects and general stupidity we're left with something so bad that it almost borders on good. Almost...
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	0	***This review is full of hilarious spoilers, be advised!***There is something about a film so bad it makes you laugh, mostly that it probably isn't worth watching and it certainly is not worth buying for more than $5. Frozen is in that category, it's so incredibly ridiculous that you're left wondering why you sat through to the end and yet your stomach hurts from laughing.The film has a simple plot: three college students are stuck on a ski lift after they beg the operator for one last run down the mountain. Why? Well, the girlfriend wasn't supposed to tag along and crashed the fun "Guy Weekend" and now feeling guilty they're headed out to try and salvage a day of dealing with the Bunny Hill.I really wanted to like this movie; I found the entire concept to be really great: stuck alone on a ski lift in freezing temperatures knowing that if you can just hang on a few more days someone will be there to rescue you. This is one of those stories that could hypothetically happen to anyone, and that's what makes it so chilling. Instead of going for that creepy feeling of loneliness and playing it to the hilt we're met with the idiotic antics of children.Now, you can say that young adults really are pretty daft in certain situations, so are adults. No one is as stupid as these characters. Jumping off a ski lift without first hanging down from the bars to give you that extra drop of height, jumping feet first, jumping at all when you know it's too high in the first place? Not army crawling over the wire toward the ladder so that you can climb to safety, the ladder you must know is there because you've been skiing your entire life and using lifts? Not huddling together for warmth? Not zipping your jackets up over your face and ears when you know you're getting frostbite? Taking off your equipment and throwing it at wolves? Wrapping your bare hand around a metal bar and somehow managing to fall asleep like that? Peeing in your own snowsuit because you can't be bothered to ask someone to help hold you while you lean over the side of the lift or at least hiking it up / down and peeing through the bars?Those are just a few of the stellar moments and really they'd be excusable if we aren't presented with the knowledge that the two boys know how to ski / snowboard well enough to go on the hardest of trails and have a lifetime of knowledge about being on a mountain in the snow. Actually no, throwing things that help keep you warm at wolves far below you thinking that will scare them off is not excusable no matter how distraught you are....Which brings me to the title of this review: the multicultural wolf pack; was it that hard to actually find a proper pack of wolves? Is it too difficult to present these animals appropriately? Or was it not fitting because wolves would never (unless rabid) act the way they do in Frozen? Seriously, you want me to stomach that wolves are going to go and eat a guy without stalking and harrying him to death. Then you want me to believe they just hung around and waited so that they could within a 15-24 hour period eat another entire human being? A bear would wait; a bear would -if hungry enough- have stalked them and eaten more than one full grown human being in a 15-24 hour period. A bear, even though it would have been hibernation season, would have made a lot more sense than a mixed pack of timber and gray wolves on a human eating binge.The characters are trite, but they're also very good portrayals of the surface level of a young adult's personality and character flaws. I could have overlooked a lot of the movie had it ended before the second wolfing (ha!) down of a character and they just froze to death and were found when the resort opened back up. That would have been really quite fantastic. Instead our intrepid fools figure out when they should be dehydrated and going through serious pangs and weakness from hunger, how to army crawl over a wire. Then he is eaten. Now we're left with the girl, who is vapid, who manages to escape to the road. I was hopeful at that point, "Please let her die right here, let her succumb, it will make her managing to shimmy on her belly past the whacky wolves alright" I thought to myself. Then she was picked up by a car, survives, touching ending where as usual in cinema the girl lives when she should have been one of if not the first one dead, and it was over.Needless to say it wasn't to my taste; there were too many glaring issues with the plausibility of such a simplistic plot to overlook. I think Frozen could have been great; it could have been well worth the entire wolf debacle. Unfortunately something that could have had that simple soul-touching horror of the everyday had a bunch of bunk injected into it and turned into something annoying and at times downright laughable.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	AquaStik Epoxy is really good at some applications, and really not great at others. Firstly, it's fantastic at affixing your live rock in a reef tank or FOWLR. It's not so great at affixing a plug for a frag into the live rock unless you have holes that it can squish into. If you're trying to get a piece of coral on a plug stuck into a more difficult area, you're going to end up frustrated with this epoxy. It has a very weak hold and even when applied if you have larger fish (or in my case an eel) they will eventually knock the entire piece of coral free.Another drawback is the smell and the fact you have to hand mix the putty together, if you have sensitive skin it will burn your fingers and be very uncomfortable. If you don't, you'll still notice the heat. It's very easy to over mix the epoxy in which case you've rendered it useless. The stench is incredible (as should be expected) so the entire application can become unpleasant. I tend to think that aquascaping should be an enjoyable thing, even if you're peppering in profanity because a rock is shifting or your coral doesn't look "just right". You don't need to muck it up with further with stinging fingers and an acrid smell.A plus is that it does really mimic the appearance of purple/red coralline algae so it will blend in if your live rock is sufficiently covered. Another is that because of its impermanent nature in an active reef tank you are just using it long enough for coral to grow into/onto the rock. If you're looking for a better solution with more varied uses than a putty I'd suggestCorAffix Cyanoacrylate AdhesiveorCorAffix Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Gel - 0.7 oz..
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	0	*This review contains spoilers of the non-vegetarian variety*Grace is one of those movies that will probably be far more disturbing to a woman than a man. That being said, disturbing is about where this movie ends at being worthwhile. It isn't a terrible film, and I'm not sure it could have been presented any better. There is something indefinable that grates on the nerves, if I had to try and put a finger on it that would probably be how unsubtly we are drawn toward the inevitable conclusion of the film.That may have been the titular problem of Grace, the fact that while it contains many things that women would find horrifying the film is determined to beat you over the head with them, making the gut wrenching grotesqueries ultimately laughable. The way that Grace is presented; an undead baby that has to feed on living blood, is painful. Especially when we take into account how deeply the mother wanted a baby and how important this was to her family. Throwing in the judgmental mother in law, ethical quandaries of a vegan main character, and creepily obsessed ex-girlfriend, and we're left with something very disturbing.Unfortunately for all the simplicity of the way the film was made the effects are at times difficult to get along with. Some of the flies are so fake it's painful, because Grace is a movie that has a very raw and honest appearance. When you have almost no special effects it is important that those put into the film flow. You end up losing the suspension of disbelief that the movie requires, and are left almost laughing at the actions of the harried mother.I really wanted to like Grace, while the ending was strangely annoying to me - after all how are you going to handle a toddler eating others, she can't breastfeed forever - the film had some very good points. The agony of the main character is very real and her desire to keep her child healthy and fit is also important. Her neurotic obsessive vegan behavior was more than slightly grating, but she's a bit insane...that's a given!Unfortunately within five minutes of the end credits I began to think on all the ways the movie wasn't believable to me. It was too over the top, too obvious, and resolved so suddenly with such a prolonged buildup and inevitably if a movie is going to leave you with that feeling it probably isn't worth watching more than once.Is Grace a terrible film? No! Is it a great or even good film? Certainly not! It is worth watching once, contemplating, and then putting aside in your mind before you begin to pick it apart like a fly going up your nose and out the other nostril picks up snot? Possibly, but probably not.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	Ink is a very strange movie that is enjoyable just for that fact. It centers around a little girl (Emma) who is stolen from her bed (whilst sleeping) and left comatose despite the best efforts of protectors - Story Tellers - who spend the nights keeping sleepers safe.Her father (John) is at once uncomfortable with his role as a parent and attempting very hard to be there for his daughter. It is almost painful to watch the way he interacts with his daughter, coworkers, and himself. The way that he handles his life is perhaps so painful because it shows the darker natures of our own being. He is not a terrible man, nor is he a good man, and his progression throughout the film is inspiring. Even the way he copes with his pain is difficult and hard to comprehend.Our young heroine / captive is delightfully imaginative and elegantly strange. Unlike most little girls who spend their lives playing with dolls in the tea party variety she is a dedicated tomboy, and endearing for it. She seems to understand with the coy intuitiveness of a child precisely how to interact with those around her.The Story Tellers dedicated to our perfection and peace during the time of sleeping are both strangely detached and overly loving. They exemplify the roles of protectors very well, trying to remain above situations and still maintain a compassion for those they protect.Ink is a frightening fellow because of his entire desire to belong which is echoed by the other characters in the film. His desperation is palpable throughout the movie. Without revealing plot, the twist of the ending - or rather its resolution - is both heartening and touching.The dream sequences of the movie, in fact, the entire movie is incredibly interestingly filmed. It is both pleasant and delightfully odd. The effects of the cameas are both heightening to the overall eery and always dreamlike qualities of the film and distracting. The film cuts around a lot as we learn about Jacob, John, Emma, and the other characters. While some of the images and presentations of characters can be grating they are acceptable because we are in a dream world for almost the entire movie. It makes sense when we stop to examine the odd way our own dreams present themselves.While it isn't perfectly filmed and is clearly a lower budget production, Ink has a very different take on a common storyline: redemption and family. It's well worth watching, and it's one of those movies you can come back to again in the future which makes it very shelf worthy.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	I wish that I loved this grinder as much as I loved the aesthetic appearance. I've been using it for a year now, and the drawbacks have become enough that I'm going to have to look for a replacement. Let's start with the pros:1) The grinder has a nice ergonomic design which makes it easy to handle.2) The cord is easy to wrap up and keep counter space clear. If you're not a regular drinker of coffee this also makes storage a lot easier in the cabinet.3) The grinder has a small footprint in your cabinet or on your counter.4) Unlike many grinders, this one will not overheat and scorch your beans, or become uncomfortable to handle.5) Very quiet, which is a huge plus when you're used to listening to your grinder rattle incessantly or whir loudly while using it.Now on to the cons that have made this an unusable grinder for me:1) While you will still need to shake the grinder to get an even mix, you have no settings for grind speed. For someone that isn't used to grinding beans (like my other half) this means that coffee can come out too coarse or too finely ground.2) There is constant drop off of your coffee grinds, they become stuck in the lid and as such fall all over your counter no matter how careful you are.3) Drawing off of point two, because of how messy this grinder is you end up with coffee grounds stuck under the base of the machine.4) As you have a higher set blade it takes a lot longer to grind your beans finely. It's inevitably not a big thing at the onset but it becomes as annoying as waiting for a slow elevator.5) This is a difficult little grinder to clean, even with a brush you're going to have problems getting under the blades.6) Blades on this machine dull rather quickly, within a few months of heavy usage (two pots a day it would seem is too much) you're going to end up having to spend longer and longer getting through your beans. After a year this can become intolerable, especially on those groggy mornings where you'd really like an easy time making a pot of coffee.When all is said and done while this is a nice looking, quiet, and ergonomic machine it has a lot of flaws. Even on sale it isn't really worth the price based on performance. Look elsewhere if you're a coffee afficionado or even if you're just a regular coffee drinker. If you want something that looks good but doesn't work particularly well - enough to get by on - this may be the machine for you.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	A note: many people with ink will agree that there is a huge debate over the very best regimen and a lot of the time it comes down to your personal preference which is paramount so long as you are using a quality product. You may not have any issues due to your skin type, area tattooed, et cetera, in other words, "Your mileage may vary" considerably.I truly did not care for this product. I live in the desert where it's always hot and the air is always dry, we have very low humidity which only exacerbates the problem of your tattoo drying out. I tried H2Ocean side by side withAquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 Ozon my tattoo, from the back of my left leg (just above the knee) to my natural waistline. I very quickly decided against this product. I tried to be fair and equal, using H2Ocean and Aquaphor on similar skin. As the inside of the thigh and the back of the leg are very sensitive and thinner skin I tried to make sure I wasn't basing my conclusions on using one product on thicker tougher skin than the other.With H2Ocean following a regimen of three showers a day and an additional washing of the tattooed area followed by a thin coat of both I found myself having to apply double the H2Ocean thanAquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 Oz. This is very expensive when you compare the cost of both products and the total area being tattooed (I'm getting a 3/4 body tattoo). In addition to the cost and having to stop and clean then apply H2Ocean more frequently I noticed a massive problem with drying out, this resulted in that irritating itching and the urge to scratch. I had none of this with my alternative unless it was in the morning when I just woke up which is to be expected.I stopped using H2Ocean pretty quickly because of these issues, it just wasn't worth the possible (additional) touchups to continue testing the product. I didn't notice an improvement in color or healing though it was less sticky. It didn't leave my skin as smooth and soft either. Frankly I don't think that (the stick and grease factor) is a big plus when ultimately we're all trying to get the best heal and the least hassle from our aftercare routine.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	Have you ever gone walking through your home and screamed, "OW!!! F%$!!!!" because you stepped on tiny shards of broken plastic? I have, and it's because of these toys. I cannot emphasize enough how terribly they are made.I thought at first that my large male Russian Blue was to blame, tipping the scales at just under twenty pounds I figured his enthusiastic pouncing on the hard tile of the kitchen was shattering these toys. A little observation proved me wrong. The easiest way these toys are broken is achieved by a juvenile cat. My young Norwegian Forest cat would be happily slapping these lattice balls around the room and smack one into the wall. It would then crack in half. This provided great amusement for a young cat, convinced that she had rendered her prey incapable of counter attack she began to chew on the halves and splintered them easily. Quick reaction was all that saved her from a very serious bill at the veterinarian.Even if they aren't knocked into a wall simply carrying the toy in your mouth as a ferocious fluffy predator results in them falling apart - usually within 24 hours. The tiny bells then become choking hazards, the pieces break, and you the beloved owner walk across the floor to get yourself a cup of coffee and find your foot bleeding. Loud utterances of profanity also tend to scare feline companions, which is just another problem with these toys. Toys should make us happy because our cats do goofy and often hilarious things with them, not enraged or in fear for our cats health and wellbeing.I thought I might have a bad batch, I had received two (one single and some mixed in with PETCO Assorted Balls for Cats Super Value Pack) so not wanting to be a total jerk human throwing away pleasurable distractions for cats I tried to rest with the same result.There is no reason to buy these, they're incredibly cheaply made and dangerous. You do not need to step on one to break it, any enthusiastic play by a cat larger than a kitten (over 5 lbs) will cause them to shatter or fall apart.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	A note: many people with ink will agree that there is a huge debate over the very best regimen and a lot of the time it comes down to your personal preference which is paramount so long as you are using a quality product. I've tried many, and this is my "happy place". Your mileage may vary.Don't waste your time with expensive products likeH2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare Lotionwhen you have a product like Aquaphor available. I am getting a 3/4 body tattoo that needless to say requires a lot of loving aftercare. While it's somewhat aggravating to have to wash your sheets more often because Aquaphor sticks to them along with any tight fitting clothes (which you shouldn't be wearing against a new tattoo) these are minor annoyances compared to having a cracking tattoo.I tested Aquaphor andH2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare Lotionside by side on a portion of my tattoo and quickly switched to straight Aquaphor. On one side I had a bit of slime from the thin coat but no scabbing, infection, or dry skin. On the other where I used the tattoo specific cream I had huge patches of skin that were cracking and flaking. While both appeared to help keep me clear of infection in those first few crucial days, I had to apply more of it and far more frequently. Using the same regimen of three showers and one extra washing with an application of both on a similar area it was clear that Aquaphor was superior. As a note of reference I did not not use it on different skin types (one over the other) but split the area horizontally in two to be fair.The product is unscented which is nice, and is good because you aren't putting any perfumes against the wounded area of skin. While alternative tattoo only creams and salves are full of additional vitamins, I have yet to notice an improvement over Aquaphor. In addition, when you're getting a very large piece you're going to need a lot of product for all the outline and coloring sessions, not to mention the tightening period. Why spend your hard earned money on something that just looks like it's going to be better for you when a cheaper product will have just as good or even more effective results.I tested this product on my left leg from the knee all the way to the hip, I noticed in addition to how well I healed that the left leg was smoother than the right after I was done healing. There really is no substitute.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	Tough Luck is one of those movies that nobody seems to have seen but is really worth watching. I picked it up several years ago in the bargain bin at Blockbuster and had the pleasure of introducing it to friends at a movie night. We all were amazed by the fact that it was so good. Recently while consolidating my movie collection I had the chance to come across this gem again and remembered just how much I enjoyed it.Tough Luck centers on a grifter, a girl, a carnival, and a lot of money. It is a heist/scam movie, but the way that it is presented is while not entirely distinct and original - very intriguing. The movie jumps around a bit and uses heavy dream like sequences to tell the story, but instead of being trying these just heighten the drama of the film. It also fits well with the fact that this movie centers around a carnival, a place we often associate with the fantastic.Archie (our grifter) is hired to work for the carnival and while pocketing as much money as he can forms a friendship with Ike (the owner) who seems utterly at a loss of what to do about his violent wife who is trying desperately to kill him. Divana is a sensual snake woman with a temper, and Archie falls into a position of being hired to kill a woman he is coming to love and lust after quite extensively. Without revealing the plot in its entirety, this is a movie with some very sudden and unexpected twists.I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy dramatic films. There's very little violence to this film (though there is some) but it has a very mature plot and doesn't pander to the audience as it follows the ups and downs of Archie's life after coming to work at the carnival. Everyone does a fantastic job with their acting, both together and apart. The movie has a very organic feel to it, and like a memory or a dream we are left waiting until the end to understand what is real and what is not, who is good and who is bad. Perhaps the best part of Tough Luck is the fact that none of the characters are intrinsically of one camp or the other.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	0	This movie could have been so very good, instead it was so very, very, incredibly bad. It is really painful to watch this film. When you want to film at night, or make it appear as if it is night, you should still (as the watcher) be able to see something of what is going on for the most part. Unless of course it's for thematic reasons that we are plunged into darkness which was not the case with Seventh Moon. The movie was just badly filmed, there's no if, and, or but about it.The plot was really interesting, for the third of the movie where they stuck with it. A honeymooning couple is in China, enjoying the countryside and the festival of the seventh moon. They are enjoying the local sights and culture, and planning on visiting the new husband's family that still lives in the country. Their driver/guide is supposed to be driving them off to their family when they fall asleep on the long drive and awaken to find themselves in the middle of proverbial nowhere outside of a small town. The driver makes several cryptic remarks and goes off to find some help, stating that he has become lost. Enter the spookiness.The couple realize (the husband was still asleep until woken) that they are alone and a great period of time has passed, they exit their vehicle and travel through this town calling out for their driver. The streets are empty; the houses appear to all be blockaded. The ominous atmosphere is palpable in these scenes, especially when they come across a strange scene of animals from the Chinese Zodiac secured as if for sacrifice in the middle of the town. Things get even eerier when they return to their car to find it covered in blood, as if to lure some form of wild animal.Secure in the knowledge that they should get the heck out of dodge they drive off, and now is where the poor filming really starts to annoy you. I'm not going to delve deeper into the plot except to say that the movie takes a huge nose dive about halfway through. It's as if they decided that the suspense they had been building wasn't worth it; let's just take a detour into magical cult happy land. It killed the entire film to me. I was left staring at my screen with an incredulous expression. The ending was especially ridiculous and typical to the American Horror genre.I had high hopes for this movie, not coming into it but because of the opening. I was really impressed with the buildup and happy because the tension and eerie nature of the entire situation the main characters are put in was different from the typical ghost/zombie/undead horde flick. Unfortunately the film takes a massive 180 degree turn from what could have been a suspenseful and dramatic horror into a very typical, easily predictable, trite tale. It took this movie from a two to a one star, because it was like watching the director throw away all the potential of Seventh Moon in favor for what might "sell" to the horror audience. Once you add in the filming and how ridiculously dark many of the scenes are (and clearly not intentionally) it's unwatchable.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	0	There are times where Mockbusters are good, I can't think of one off the top of my head at the moment but trust me there are a few that are so intentionally insane and funny that you just have to love them. This is not a good Mockbuster and for that I am sad.It's a rip off, pulling from Exorcist, Entity, and of course Paranormal Activity. It's so very badly done. The entire film reeks of really bad logic flaws that most Mockbusters manage to avoid in all their low budget glory. For example: a ghost walks on the ceiling so let's hang bells on wire at foot level because surely that will work. Wait, it does?The biggest problem with this Mockbuster was that they couldn't use that fishing wire they were employing to actually film the paranormal scenes. What sort of freaky German ghost cretin closes a closet door before molesting a girl in her sleep? I mean, why bother? They aren't going to see your face! Especially since her brother has no qualms about filming her breasts multiple times, and is far more concerned with holding the camera than helping her; you're a ghost, you aren't even related to her. Turn on the radio to some Barry White and get jiggy with it Maron!The set was painfully sparse and eye offensive, I mean, pink and green pillows on outdoor furniture serving as living room accoutrements? How gauche! Even worse you take the time to clean your ceiling of ghost footprints made by the ashes of your deceased loved one (the father / husband of the family) and yet you don't remove the ink on the glass top coffee table that wipes away clean in one scene and is impervious the next? Poor form, bad cleaning, tsk tsk.Obviously we never learn why the boy doesn't just call the police since there's a lapse between their deaths and his arrival, or why his sister makes that really bad fake choking noise, or even, well...anything. I don't want to know where that ghost had his nether regions!There are some amusing Mockbusters out there, but for the most part I was trying to figure out how they couldn't manage to close doors with fishing line or have footprints of different shapes, and how you could (on the door note) even live in a house with nothing being flush and creaking all the time. This movie hurts the ears, from the bad screams to the bad doors.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I picked up Texhnolyze without knowing the first thing about the series. It has a very techno (imagine that), futuristic theme, and if you've watched Lain it includes some of that surreal mixed media effect but to even better result in my opinion. As opposed to the standard introduction to a show where the opening theme is a song showing all the characters and usually accompanied by karaoke Texhnolyze starts out with music, no lyrics. The ending theme is on par with what we've come to expect, a moody acoustic sequence. The two musical styles harmonize each other, moving together in a strange symbiosis through the show. It might seem odd to say such a thing about a soundtrack, but this show makes everything go together and every facet is important.Extras included on disc one are: an interview with Ueda and Yoshitoshi Abe, alternate dialog outtakes, previews (they mercifully skip them at the start of the DVD but if you want them they are there), and credits for the show.The show starts off in a dank and dirty place, it appears to be a decrepit locker room complete with dingy mirror, tiled shower stalls, flickering lights, and a clicking fan. Our silent and slightly bloodied main character is reliving a boxing match, the scenes are granulated like a bad television signal. From there we move on to another scene, a strange woman with him, and then another. The show has little dialog in the opening, it relies on you carefully watching the myriad presented to you so that you can understand what is going on.Of course as soon as you think you know what's going on something changes, we're left wondering what's reality and what's going on between the few characters already introduced. It's as if the viewer is being dumped straight into the disparate parts of each persons day and yet some of it, maybe all of it, is just a dream. The colors of every different moment are highly saturated, and it's clear we're in a futuristic society where our interactions with the world overlap with another, digital / mystical layer to existence.I was struck by how stark the world is, the silence, the lack of animals (minus a lizard seen in the first episode), the missing grass and trees, the decay of buildings, roads; seemingly all of our world. It's so empty and painfully lonely. It's really no wonder that they cannot bring themselves to speak much of the time. Even in the cities people are quiet, detached, as if they are trying to simply get by. What words are there in a place so desolate? When characters do immerse in dialog it's been clearly well thought out by the director, just enough to explain and confuse what's going on at that particular moment.By the end of the first disc we are made to understand that there is a Salvation Union, Raffia, Organo, a Sage of Gabe, a surface, and an "underworld". We know that we are in Lukuss. Dialog increases but the show is still heavily dependant on visuals. We know what it means, at least a little, to be Texhnolyzed. What precisely all of that solves, means, and teaches us remains unclear the more we learn. There's a sort of intrinsic beauty to that, it leaves us wanting more, and as confused and unsure as the characters each holding a piece of the puzzle but unable to put together the complete picture.This is a great start to a series, a lush and well drawn foray into a world we're just beginning to grasp and the politics and people of the time. It isn't for children, while it doesn't have excessive violence, it isn't sensationalized in battle sequences when it occurs. There's a cold brutality and chilly compassion involved in the episodes that start the show. If you're a fan of the surreal and technological, pick it up and have a go.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I started listening to Alison Sudol years ago, and if that isn't a testament to an artist that you are still enjoying their album after all that time then I don't know what is. It took me a while to really warm up to her but since there hasn't been a time where I haven't enjoyed her music.It's simple as a rule for this album, fresh and clean her lyrics are complimented by her no-nonsense vocals. She isn't one of those artists that plays around with tons of instruments and track mixing. I appreciate that, it's good relaxing sound when you're puttering around the house or on a long drive. It's also perfect for the background when curled up with a cup of tea and a good book, and equally enjoyable when you just want to listen to something.Comparing this to her second album I have to say I still prefer One Cell in the Sea for most occasions, though if you enjoyed this offering you will find tracks like Elements and Happier on her newest album particularly enjoyable; she notes herself that Bomb in a Birdcage is a testament to her somewhat wilder side.I was introduced to her music by the track You Picked Me and Hope for the Hopeless, which remain my favorites. What I have noticed however is that depending on mood different pieces on this CD will appeal to me. I don't have any "skips", which can be hard to say for many artists.To sum up, if you're looking for soft yet strong vocals, simple but impressive medleys, and those tunes that end up stuck in your head this is a good album. If you're looking for something completely upbeat or depressing this isn't it. It's something soft enough and comfortable enough for every occasion.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I picked up this album on the basis of liking one song, "Your Battlefield" and having heard and enjoyed "Seasons Change". I first heard her music on Imeem, and when the service changed over and I lost access to my playlists I completely forgot about this artist. Browsing Amazon I came across her again and simply had to have her CD. I'm glad that I made the purchase.Ms. Suh doesn't bring anything particularly innovative or new to the table, she isn't a revolutionary artist, she isn't going to show you something sparkly and fantastically different that will move you to the core. There's nothing wrong with that. She's simply a pleasant listen, a soft touch in times where so many genres are pushing harder and faster for the artificial sound. I truly appreciate this, and I can't get enough of it.The acoustic quality of her songs isn't perfection but it's soothing, even her less pleasantly themed songs are uplifting in their own right because of her voice. This is a huge asset that disappeared from the world for several years, you couldn't find that silky and yet at times gravelly voice that rang with humanity in any new form. She did release the Bakman Tapes Pt. 1 & 2 in 2010 and they are perhaps even more moving than this compilation if you can get your hands on them.The music you will find on her self titled debut (and hopefully not her only album) is slow, soft, delicate, and easy on the ears. It is to me the music of a rainy day curled up with a book or cuddled near the fireplace relaxing after a long week. Her voice is never grating, never rough, and always just enough to be there but never oppressive in its melancholy. That is a talent in and of its self worth lauding.This may not be something you want to listen to every day, it is still worth listening to and having in your collection because while it isn't intrinsically different it's got a distinct flavor all its own.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	0	1	This book did a lot of harm when trying to build a 90 gallon predatory fish reef tank after having fallen out of the hobby for many years (and previously only having a FOWLR). I would not suggest this to anyone, especially not a beginner in need of serious guidance and easy answers. If you are looking for some very helpful books that you will want to keep in your collection for the years to come I would suggest:1)The Marine Fish Health & Feeding Handbook: The Essential Guide to Keeping Saltwater Species Alive and Thriving2)Aquarium Corals : Selection, Husbandry, and Natural History3)The Conscientious Marine Aquarist: A Commonsense Handbook for Successful Saltwater Hobbyists (Microcosm/T.F.H. Professional)4)The New Marine Aquarium: Step-By-Step Setup & Stocking GuideDepending on your personal experience in the hobby some may be more helpful than others, but none are one read wonders. Suggestions out of the way let's look at why this book is far more confusing than helpful for someone brand new to saltwater systems.1) This book regurgitates very old and out of date knowledge about filtration and tank cycling, it does not take into account newer methods that have been proven viable and safe alternatives over the past five years. Due to this you can be fooled into believing there is only one right way to set up a tank, keep it clean and healthfully balanced, and cycle it.2) There are very few helpful diagrams that will outline to a saltwater newbie the different ways and different parts of a filtration system and other plumbing for your tank. Now you're left searching again.3) This book fails to explain some of the very strange and beautiful ways a tank changes while it is cycled, this can leave someone new to the hobby flailing in panic searching the internet for answers on what Pineapple sponges are, what types of algae blooms are to be expected and how to take care of them, and what harmful algae should be immediately removed because it won't just fall into balance.4) There is very little information in this book on hitchhikers and why they can be beneficial nor is there a guide to when they should be removed and that is so vitally important to someone starting out. One bad hitchhiker can destroy most of if not all of your work.5) Common pests and ways to avoid them are almost entirely left out.6) There is inadequate representation of lighting systems, their differences, uses, and the pros and cons of the use of one versus another for your tank based on what you are stocking or your long-term goals.7) We have a wealth of beautiful marine life available in this hobby, while no book will cater to everyone's needs there isn't anything new about what fish truly do well with one another. It leaves out the importance of tank size in determining the approach of stocking, some fish will be far more dangerous to one another in a closer and/or larger environment in other words they will no longer be compatible. It gives canned responses to how you should stock your tank by size of fish to gallon, when temperament and environment can be and usually is far more important. Even sand and the amount used in an aquarium can determine the health and happiness of your fish depending on the species, while that may be more in depth it's invaluable.These are only a few reasons why this book falls far short of being anything close to a guide. If you're new to the hobby please check out other books (there are many more quality reads than just my base suggestions above), find a good LFS (live fish store), and try to meet people in your city / town that share in this passionate and often confusing world. You've just started a fantastic journey that will unfortunately cost you quite a bit of money; make sure you spend it where it will do you and your tank the best.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	Moth Smoke is a short but interesting novel that focuses on the imprisonment of Daru and the events that lead to the downfall of his life. The book appears at first to skip around, and can become somewhat confusing as you're taken through the twists and turns of the upper and middle class of Pakistan. As you traverse the novel you meet different characters who all play an important part in Daru's life, and have a large affect on his fate.While the book starts, centered in the courtroom where he is accused of murdering a child, it quickly shifts to the story as it needs to be told by the main character and eventually his former best friend, his once lover (who is also his best friend's wife) and brief appearances from servants to pugnacious rickshaw drivers.Though we learn a great deal about Daru's life, from being fired from his job and living without electricity in the middle of the hot Pakistani summer what is more important is the relationships he has and the different perspectives that all of the characters have on how his life and the story unfolds. I found this enchanting and very well pulled off, it gives the reader a glimpse into other minds and a chance to see through other eyes throughout the book.This isn't a novel that alienates those who are unfamiliar with the culture of Pakistan, it does a very good job of illustrating the different nuances and differences of life and the author makes several acerbic but accurate observations on his culture. If anything, Moth Smoke is about the plight of the common man in a country struggling at once for footing in the modern world and global economy and the people who are trapped between classes hard to bridge for both old and new reasons.I deeply enjoyed this book and the style of writing employed by Mohsin Hamid, he at once conveys the frustrations, elation, and tribulations of his characters. Meanwhile he manages to weave together the snapshot of a man's life with the fate of an entire nation, and for that this work should be applauded.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I picked up this fantastic book based on the overwhelmingly positive nature of the reviews posted and was not disappointed. It's not often that you find a bar guide that takes such care in pairing drinks with foods. On top of this Nick Mautone has taken incredible steps to make this book useful to the novice and experienced mixologist.Even if you should find yourself disliking the majority of drinks included in "Raising the Bar" you will gain a deeper insight into the art of pairing food and drink for a truly divine dining experience. This is an art that is lost in many homes, and one that needs the kind of attention and care that has been offered in this handy hardcover tome.While there are more advanced (but simple to prepare) drinks included in this book the overall message is one of the simplicity of enhancing any experience with food by including the proper spirits.In addition "Raising the Bar" is well put together: it's a sturdy hardcover book with thick pages, lush photography and easy to read type. The ease of using this book makes it an essential companion to your family bar, kitchen, or bookshelf.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	I had never been an avid fan of Bruch until I listened to Midori play. It is sometimes that way with music, especially classical, we can find our ears simply turn off to the playing of one orchestra or individual and then when another plays the same piece we are left breathless. This is the way I am with Bruch and Midori, there are many talented violinists whom I adore for their renditions of other pieces - Sarah Chang for her Vivaldi springs to mind immediately. For Midori it is either Bruch or Paganini, and I cannot begin to comment further than that on the power this woman wields with her hands and a bow.It is possibly best to avoid deep comparisons and critiques from the standpoint of one who is an avid listener of classical music, because that breed is set - our opinions have been made up and our favorites picked - often years before a recording is remastered. It is to the people who have heard little classical music and want to experience it, to understand why there are people who cry at the orchestra, artists who bend with their instruments when they play, and those who simply close their eyes and breathe in the sound around them. There is something magical and moving about the way Midori plays Mendelssohn and Bruch that you can feel through your speakers and headphones, that will settle in your bones and infect your soul with the power of classical music.That is not something to take lightly, nor is it something to miss out on. There is a reason these pieces of music, these concertos have existed and persisted for so many decades. They are more than what you listen to on the radio, they are the soundtracks of cartoons, movies, even video games, because of their power to convey an emotion in any medium and to heighten those that already exist in us...the listeners.I highly recommend this album to anyone new to classical music and to existing fans of either composer who have not had the chance to hear Midori.
A1CKY01WDLN1DK	1	1	There are many adjectives that could be used to describe this book; hilarious, intriguing, exciting, dark, macabre, poignant, paranoid, and perhaps most importantly "meh". I suppose that would be the greatest of praises you could give our main character: to read the book and decide to go get drunk on pitcher of warm Miller in some bar we've never bothered to learn the name of. There wasn't a page of Apathy that didn't leave me laughing, which is perhaps hard to understand if you haven't been faced with the life of a man that starts and stops at a Greyhound station.Ultimately this is a book about death, and a book about living without fear of it. Or perhaps it's about a fear of vampires and a compulsive need to steal saltshakers. It is without doubt a piece of dark humor worth reading, and worth buying in hardback if you can as it's something you're going to want to read again. There are so many brutally funny lines, observations, and characteristics we all share in some way.I don't know if Apathy made me want to go pick up a decrepit child's bike and ride it to work every day, but it did throw into stark contrast that sometimes you aren't an urban warrior you're just what everyone thinks is the mentally handicapped fellow riding his bike to who knows where.I think the greatest humor of Apathy is what we have all been embarrassed by in our lives, being the person in a crowded room talking at full volume and then suddenly it's silent and you're the victim of some horrible out of context soundbite. The things we say, think, and feel are so often taken out of context by those around us but in a state of apathy we can just let that go and without caring just roll with it.If there were a way to encapsulate the plot of this book into a small space I would, I don't think it's entirely possible but here's a shot:You wake up covered in salt, realize there are police in your room, get harassed for a bit and begin to question your own drinking binges. You're having sex with your landlord's wife to get money knocked off the rent and you really think your landlord is a nice guy, your neighbor is possibly violating his pet guinea pig upstairs at all hours of the day and night, you don't pay your dentist and learned sign language from his assistant. Did I mention that your dentist has to drink iced tea to get over his panic attack / fainting spells? On top of this your one night stand turned into a crazy series of weird almost dating experiences with a woman you can't be with unless drunk and she thinks body shot is when she cripples you in bed, oh and she got you a job alphabetizing paperwork at an insurance company where you sleep on the toilet all day as a form of art and protest.See, that's not even the half of it.Go, go, read now!
A1CL30EGOAFPZD	1	1	I should begin with a brief disclaimer here. I am one of the pastors of one the churches in the Acts 29 Network which is a church planting network based out of Mark's church in Seattle (mars hill). I have personally benefited from Mars Hill's commitment to church planting. Additionally, a couple of years back I helped plan and run an Acts 29 bootcamp in our city with Mark as the key speaker. At the end of that conference, we were all hanging out having dinner and Mark channeled what sounded like the voice of Donald Duck in an effort to entertain my then 1 year old daughter. It worked. Anyone who makes my kids laugh without ulterior motives is instantly on my "good guy" list. So . . . I came to this book expecting good things. Mark delivered. The book is witty and cutting in a "breath of fresh air" kind of way. I'm an admitted mars hill groupie watching from the east coast, so it was cool to see the behind the scenes kind of stuff from a pastoral perspective. If you listen to the podcasts on a regular basis, much of this book will feel like the clip show from your favorite TV program, but that's actually a good thing in this case because you get to see it all in chronological order. The best thing about this book is its honesty and truthfulness. Mark shares plenty of mistakes he made, which should be encouraging to church planters in a sick and twisted kind of way. The big lesson I take from this book is simple . . . stay on mission regardless of what people try to pull you into, and stay focused on Jesus. Mark is a Jesus nut and that's a big complement! Pastors. . . read this book and reevaluate your church. Church members . . . read this book, then give it to your pastor and tell him that when he's done you'll take him out for an expensive dinner to discuss its contents.
A1CL30EGOAFPZD	1	1	I'm a big Disney fan. Having read "the animated man" all about Walt's life, I wanted to learn more about his right hand man. While Walt came up with great ideas, Roy (his older brother) ran the company and found the money to keep Walt going. This is a very interesting look at the man who occupied the second chair of one America's most influential companies. Great book.

A1CL30EGOAFPZD	1	1	I have read Howard Hendricks "Living by the Book" multiple times and found it helpful. But for many people teaching in their churches, the book is too long and some may lose attention. This classic book was something I was introduced to in Seminary and have rediscovered it in doing some teaching at my church. I'm now realizing that because it is shorter, punchier and (honestly) just thinner . . . it may be a more easily approachable tool for the average congregant.Additionally, I really appreciate the focus on "actualizing your convictions" at the end.Glad to have re-found this book.
A1CL549T4CNODG	1	1	A publisher at Harvard University Press, Waters is the right person to offer this critique. He ruthlesly criticizes the coroporate, quantifying mentality that has crept into academics, destroying the authority and prestige of scholarly book publishing.The last chapter is the best to read. There are nice quotes such as "Thinking is not like watching a lightning storm but more like catching lightning bugs."Unfortunately, the book is hobbled by its own old-fashioned views. Too many books are being published, true. But Waters is part of the problem. He begins by saying that he has "an inordinate love of books." Well, so do tenure committees. At inordinate and unhealthy levels.He criticizes the academic's unwarranted garrulousness. But he doesn't realize that this worship of the book (good, bad or ugly) has origins in the West's worship of books, texts, great books and great authors, as displayed in his own comments that "works of art spring us forth into momentary glory" and that the function of the humanities is to connect us to "great works of art." Waters elsewhere makes much of his aesthetic preoccupations, but does not acknowledge how restricted his account of the aesthetic experience is. His account of aesthetic experience is a text-obsessed, cognition-oriented, book-loving version. Pure eurocentric high-culturalism.
A1CL549T4CNODG	0	0	This book is pointless, boring and a waste of paper. Bunch of anthropologists sharing their tepid ruminations.
A1CL549T4CNODG	1	1	really good book; "Bangalore Stories" is a touching quasi-ethnographic portrait of Bangaloreans today. I came across this book by accident and was very impressed.
A1CL6DCIJZG2LX	1	1	These are the only goggles my narrow-faced 10YO daughter has found that don't leak. Seem to be quite sturdy and comfortable--we lose them way before they wear out! :)
A1CL6DCIJZG2LX	1	1	This is a nice-sized plastic insulated water bottle. Washes well in the dishwasher and seems sturdy. The bottle gets knocked around a lot (gym bag, car, pool) and seems to be holding up well. We still have our green one...too bad we lost the pink one.
A1CL6DCIJZG2LX	1	1	I ordered this for my daughters to use with their keyboard as their piano teacher said they were ready for it. I know nothing about pedals, but it seems sturdy (it is quite heavy) and the girls like it. It sits on berber carpet and there have not been any complaints about it sliding around. I just plugged it in and it worked!
A1CL6DCIJZG2LX	1	0	I bought these to take to Disney since I thought they might be easier than spray (our usual) or lotion or stick (for faces/lips). Turns out the family liked these best! As a buyer/user of lots of different sunscreen products, I thought these were great. Once we tried them, that's all anybody wanted to use. They don't have much of a fragrance (not bad), and once the product dried, it wasn't sticky. I agree with other reviewers that you will need 2 for adults and kids in swimsuits. If I was just covering kids arms/lower legs/face, I could get away with one. You can use these in small spaces (like on Disney's monorail or in a Disney que/line) without spraying other people! Will definitely buy these again. Hint: if you are going to open more than 1 package, make sure to open all the packages before you start applying, b/c the packs are hard to open once you get the sunscreen on your hands from the wipes.
A1CLDGWSKRLN35	1	1	I enjoyed this movie .now I'm reading the book ,as above, and they are very similar. the book is good too.sorry i sound like a 2 year old but I'm really just curious about this.
A1CLL78B2X7F2X	1	1	My kids - 11, 9 & 5 got 2 sets for Christmas. They love it! They have made many different configurations on their own. It turns into so many imaginative things for the kids to pretend in - spaceships, cars, castles, forts, etc. They even enjoy building something they can lay in and watch TV or play a game. Great toy Cranium!
A1CLL78B2X7F2X	0	1	Alright, I see other reviews below that have stated that if you use the correct screwdriver, duh, it will open. Well guess what, it won't on mine. The screws just turn and turn and never come completely loose. Three different people worked on this thing Christmas day! They need to redesign the battery compartment. It looks like a fun toy, but until we return ours and get one that we can put batteries in, we will never know.

I have been washing him every other day with it and his scratching has gotten so much better. The sores are almost all gone.
A1CLL78B2X7F2X	1	1	I was looking for a watch for my 12 year old son. This watch is the perfect size. It has any function he needs and looks cool. What more could you want?
A1CLL78B2X7F2X	1	1	I use this on my Westie and he smells so good. There is no horrible wet dog smell after his bath. His fur is so soft and fluffy. Love it! I also love the fact that all of the ingredients are natural.
A1CLL78B2X7F2X	0	0	I am really disappointed in this band. I purchased the black, x-heavy, for my son who was wanting a little more resistance in a band. He is currently using a blue of a different brand, which is considered heavy. This band doesn't have anywhere near the resistance that the other one has, it is maybe a medium. There is also an extremely visible seam in this band that looks like it might snap after a few uses. I would not recommend purchasing this brand of exercise loop.
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	0	0	In fact in despite of his title the book has a little focus in Yoruba culture. Most of time it talk about Ifa Poetry and religion meaning. It is actually not a scholar work as we could expect from Kola and each capter's theme is not explained with a real deep and consistent approach.Really I was upset about the way he talk about Idowu ideas regards Olodumare belief. Idowu, has at least 2 books about his ideas and this book are a serious and used until this days by a lot of authors. Right or wrong Idowu used 2 extensive books to explain his ideas and seems to have done a long field work. If Kola don't agree with him has to make something similar, look for source and also review early authors, as Verger did in his article The Yoruba High God. Kola support his ideas just citing Idowu work, using few lines in Ifa poetry and make highlights in mistakes in translation of few words and stuff like that. In fact he use some lines of Ifa poems to support his idea, but, however, he forgets to mention the others one or Yoruba myths which support the other side.One interest thing is to create a model for Yoruba religion Theogony, but it is a small content for too many pages. I also already read different interpretation for the number of irunmole. Kola use the numbers 201 and 401 as a precise amount of divinities, but some people also interpret this numbers as meaning "a lot of" instead of a precise number. In fact number in Yoruba language is very complicate and it is far from be used as we do in our decimal system.In case of medicine, in despite of this theme, again, he does a superficial approach classifying mainly as "homeopatic" instead herbalist (I think it is not a precise way to define his medicine...), and soon abandoning this and again talking about divinities. In the end of book he goes to Yoruba culturte theme, but also, very superficial and ignoring some very special aspects of a non-secular society.Well, I can say I found some interesting informations in the book, but in general it was very deceptive for me. Kola came from the Nigerian society and had the opportunity to have a very good scholar formation. Also he is song of W.Abimbola and in this way, for me, in this book, he look like some one defending the Ifa ideas, or the awo's Ifa ideas or interests. Ok, it can be a unfair comment but also he was unfair in his book.My opinion is Kola should spend more time and more research before publish a book. It is a very early product without a real and deep research and content. It is far from to be a has to have, or best one book. It is just another book. There is a lot better than this one.
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	1	1	I didn't write a review before because I found a lot of here then it looks like me unnecessary. However I read a lot of unfair reviews and I would like to left here my opinion.In fact, lele is a very polemic person in lukumi, I guess. I already heard a lot of things about him and also see some discussion in lukumi foruns where he is. Some people say he got the information about this book in a incorrect way, but, sincerely for who want to read the book it doesn't matter.I have a lot of Ifa and erindilogun books and nobody write deep about nothing. The Cubans are the people who are concerned do write more extensively about anything and the africans only publish incomplete Ifa poetry. Therefore, this book here is one the best source available to be acquired. Ones can say it is not complete. Yes can be, but considering every one think he self is better than the other everything is incomplete, it is, some will always say something is missing or wrong.In this case here, I didn't find any relevant error, better, I don't think some one can say there is a error here, because every one has his own method or information.For my self I already compared this book with Cuba Ifa documents (Dice de Ifa), more than one source and the interpretation is the same. Well here is better written, more extensive, etc.. Some times lele is too much prolix, they write too much for say something. Also there is some signs where the interpretation is not clear, is very vague, but it also happens in Cuban Ifa tratados.This book's content is so good or so bad like any other Cuban Ifa source. Also, the Yoruba words are so bad like it is spoken in Cuba, because, Cubans don't know to speak or write Yoruba correctly. Therefore this book only reflects how the cubans use yoruba. If you want you can, like me, correct the words after a hard work. Also you use the prays listed if you want, you also can use your own.The important in my opinion is this book is very extensive and complete. You can use it and also change the procedures to adapt it to your way. Also in terms os erindilogun it doesn't teach how to use the opon and the owo eyo graphical configuration to improve the interpretation, Lele use the wow eyo as an opele, losing a lot of capabilities, but it is a way to use the oracle.I am using this book for a long time together with others sources, cuban or african, and I can say everything here is useful, from interpretation to ebos.There is few books in world about erindilogun. This is one of these.
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	0	0	This book is poor. No way to use it. The "verses" are not original. Don't help you as an awo or babalawo. Don't help you as a ifa student. You will not find here relation with others Ifa texts.
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	1	1	It is a expensive book. May be expensive too much. But, for get good If&aacute; information, as you can get here, the price is OK.The good thing: The book use extensively verses to explain If&aacute;. You will find the Yoruba and the english translation. Because of this, this book has so many pages. Therefore don't expect to find a lot of information about If&aacute;. You will find good information about some themes, not about everything.Some things are very strange. In the beginning it spent a lot of pages, may 1/4 or more of the whole book, in a conceptual approach about If&aacute;. Things regards values. Interesting matter, of course, but it not deserve so many pages in a expensive book. Probably could be a lot of pages in a regular price book.But, after this, you will find the jewels of crown in this book. It explain how to understand and interpret the Od&ugrave; verses. really, really believe me, very good.... after this it also explain to how to make a ebo riru. All steps, Odu and verses used. Also, very good.I liked this book. 1/2 of this I liked too much, 1/2 not so much. But following the oral tradition in this religion we have to know the verses where the truth lies and learn how to understand it through the verses.However, don't create too much expectation. Like I said, it is not an outstanding book. You will surelly learn some interesting things and also get verses about a lot of things. However the verse has not a whole version, it is only a small portion.I guess a babalawo and an awo will find this book more usefull than a non initiated. It is not a book for you to buy to understand what is Ifa or the religion. It is a book to you understand better.
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	0	0	It contains a lot of myths related with the religion, mainly. However the stories are too short, only a very small version of the original myth. The main purpose behind a Yoruba myth is not the story itself, but the values and ethic from religion and popular culture. Therefore as are, the stories in this book, you can't understand it. In fact, in my opinion, if you don't see the details and also in some cases stanzas you will have a very bad perception of the Yoruba culture. Then, I think, why this book? May be just a list if some yoruba myths, not all and with no deep content.I apreciate a good job, but I can't say this book is one
A1CLMF7IB2H33P	0	0	Apetebi has distincts views from Cuban and Nigerian Ifa traditions. This book show the Nigerian tradition. In this tradition Apetebi is the wife of babalawo, it is not a title (oye), which you can grant like it is done in Cuban tradition. Also, in Cuban tradition, only, the woman doesn't has to sleep with the Babalawo for to be an Apetebi.For the Nigerians Apetebi is an actual wife of babalawo and they can have a lot of wives.For the USA market the Nigerians came with a different view, more like the cubans and show, for mercantil purpose only, some respect for the women. But this treatment doesn't reflect the way as they do inside his country. Therefore there is an Ifa in Nigerian and other in USA and other countries. Distincts rules. Things theyr never do in his country they do oversea.Please, don't say you don't know about this.Iaynifa is a good example, just made for the foreign consume (and money). Rare, very rare in Nigeria.This book is old, writen when there was not so many comercial interests. Then you will see really how the Nigerian see the women through his religion, Ifa corpus. Reading this book you will understand why Ifa is a male cult and how lost are the women who think can have space here.This is only a review then there is no space to talk about how contraditory is see how is the role of women in Ifa stanza and, by the other side, how high is the respect for the female gender in divine sphere.Thi book has a very simple structure. He show a lot of stanza where the women has the rule of orunmila's wife. Most of then female divinities. Don't expect long texts explaining the context. You will find stanzas. It is good, this is the Ifa way and Ifa is not for stupid people.However, Ifayemi never write too much. He is very economical with the words then I didn't like the transcription. They show a short version of each Odu, unfortunatelly. Some stories are very interesting and rich in his original version and here we have only a poor version. Then it is a bad job he could be more honest and put here the original version of each Od&ugrave; which he selected.I think he think we are only idiots who don't deserve or can't learn or understand Ifa. May be only our money is good for him, that is because this he writes this poor book.But at least he indicate the Od&ugrave; where you can find the stanza. But, he use the alias odu name, not the original name it is not a problem but could be different.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	1	This hub does everything I want it to do, worked from the time I plugged it in. I have had it now for a couple of months. I run my printer, a digital camera & a couple of flash drives through it. All no problem.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	0	1	If this is what it takes to "WIN" then we are all in big trouble. Thank goodness I bought this used. I guess you have to be part of the business cult to get why being arrogant and greedy is a good thing. I will be burning this one and after seeing this guy on Colbert Report the other night it just proved to be that even the "best" CEO's are cruel and heartless. NO THANKS, I will stay with my simple mom & pop and forgo the fortune.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	1	Geez - this is not a highbrow commentary on college life or getting turned down by schools you don't want to go to anyway. It's a comedy & it is very successful at that, three generations in our home watched it together & loved it. Lewis Black is supurb as the most intelligent dean I have ever seen. These guys had fun making this movie and it shows. (if you are scared of words, you will not like all the "dirty" language, but there are PLENTY of Disney films for you)
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	1	I really liked Lady in the Water - we watched it at home & I bought it the next day. Very edge of your seat, like most fairy tales, scary but without gore. Great creatures. Well done film making.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	1	This item is just what I needed, it raises my CPU up off the floor & rolls great on my laminate floor. Does just what it is supposed to do.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	0	0	My daughter bought this printer after I warned her about tri-color cartridges. Now she is stuck buying these totally rip-off ones. Until people realize that the largest cost of owning a printer is NOT the printer, but the ink, they will continue to get ripped off.Unless you are only using your printer once a month or so, AVOID tri-color cartridge printers like the plague. Buy ONLY printers that can use inexpensive third party cartridges or that you can refill. If no one buys them, they will quit making them.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	0	I found help in this book. I think it fulfills the intended purpose, for those of us who were not raised within the culture to find peace within ourselves using the terminology of the Native American to break us out of our linear thinking. I don't believe the author meant for the book to be a guide to "becoming an Indian" or anything like that. This was the first step on my road. It has also helped me to understand some of the things my Grandfather said to me. I feel very strongly that this book can help those who may be searching for a spiritual way to connect with the Universe, so much so I am here today buying one for a friend.
A1CLOIF10O7G75	1	1	I use this to carry two usb drives to client meetings, it is nice and compact & hooks right onto my lanyard (not included). The hook is metal instead of plastic which is a nice change. It protects the drives & is kinda cute.
A1CLPS50IQ1AS7	0	0	Not powerful - barely moves the air. It didn't have a remote as I wanted.Not at all happy - would never buy this brand again - definitely substandard.
A1CLPS50IQ1AS7	1	1	Thoroughly &#34;enjoyed&#34; this disturbing book - it gives a whole new perspective on the Middle East issues.Highly recommended - a good read.
A1CM52MR5OPJH3	1	0	If someone doesn't recommend Walter Dean Myer's book, Patrol for some type of award, let me be the first. In this time of contemplating war, this book is so appropriate, although I would not recommend it for use with students below 5th grade. This picture book made me feel what it must feel like to be a grunt on the field. Powerful!

A1CM52MR5OPJH3	1	1	...Then we'll have to wait for you to try to move them to Christianity after that. And if Christianity is just one of three possibilities among the monotheistic religions, then you are asserting (or rather conceding) that it is also possible that it is not true. Your apologetic reveals your theology, so be consistent.Hopefully you will read this book BEFORE you consider taking that cheap and easy route to an apologetics certificate, or degree. But if not, God brought you to this product page for a reason and Van Til will set you straight. The cost of this book is cheap in comparison to the myriad offerings of today's so-called apologetics experts.This book is not an easy read, far from it, but Dr. Oliphint does a great job of keeping us in the game with his footnotes and mini-bios. So, if you are looking to get at the crux of what it means to become a Christian, you have found the right book. If you are tired of the cliches and drivel being offered as &#34;helps&#34; to bring the unbeliever to Christ, and are ready to be transformed by the renewing of your mind, then take some time and drink this one in. You will be changed for the better, and so will your audience. Then let me know if I was right, by clicking &#34;yes&#34; on &#34;was this review helpful to you&#34; below.
A1CMD6SU5VHMX5	1	0	I ordered these rollers from Amazon, and received the rollers with 20 metal pins instead of clips, so I called Conair and they promptly shipped the 20 clips to me at no charge. The roller heats up fairly quickly, but can get a little too hot, so I usually open one side of the cover when I'm ready to roll. Each set comes with 3 different sizes of rollers.
A1CMD6SU5VHMX5	1	1	We bought this a month ago, when the weather was really cold and dry, so needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised and appreciative that it arrived within 2 days from Amazon, with free shipping.Being that this is our first humidifier, so I have no other comparisons. But it was easy to set up, and we do use filtered water as adviced by other reviewers.One most important thing to note is that there is a faint motor humming sound when turned on, which can be quite annoying if you are used to sleeping in an almost completely quiet room.... not sure if this sound is normal though. There is also a water gurgling sound every once in a while at medium to high setting.Other than the sounds, this humidifier does work, and the cow is adorable.
A1CMD6SU5VHMX5	1	1	I initially bought this for making cookies, but also used it for serving our pizza. We cut the pizza using the pizza cutter and was surprised that it didn't hurt the surface at all. I would highly recommend.
A1CMD6SU5VHMX5	1	1	We have had this for about 1 month now. When I first opened the box, I was a little disappointed that the color is not quite the shiny dark blue as pictured, but rather, it is a pen ink blue without the gloss.Most importantly, it only keeps fresh coffee hot for about 3 to 4 hours, definitely not 13. But it doesn't hold a lot of coffee anyway, about 5 to 6 small cups, so we do typically finish the whole pot of coffee within a couple of hours anyway.I like the easy one hand operation lid, although it does seem a little flimsy. Hopefully it doesn't break too soon.Edit 5/1/2010: Still works after 2 years. What a great buy!
A1CNFOPAU7FRMZ	1	0	More realistic than winning eleven.Playing with winning eleven you have a situation that Ronaldinho will miss a shot a couple of inches from the goal with no goalkeeper - with FIFA07 things like this doesn't happen.Less controls than winning eleven but much better graphics. Easy to play , configure, lot's of fun. Updated teams. At least 10 times more teams available than Winning Eleven
A1CNFOPAU7FRMZ	0	1	Don't even think about buying it. Even if you were addicted to Atari when you're kid you would find boring playing with your PS and LCD TV.
A1CNFOPAU7FRMZ	1	1	Works great, easy to install and configure.However, if you have a printer/scanner combo scanning functions doesn't work trough this server - you will need to connect scanner directly to pc/notebook.
A1CNFOPAU7FRMZ	1	1	You might not guess just from looking at it, but the Tissot T-Touch feels just as at home in the woods, in the mountains, or on long treks as it does in the office or at a cocktail party. The T-Touch combines good looks, rugged functionality, and impressive innovation in way you rarely see in the watch world.
A1CNIBLO0PSI51	0	0	5 stars? 4 stars? 3? Really. No Lou Gramm and you can justify giving this pile more than a quarter star? How dare you. Foreigner IS Lou Gramm. Anything less is a cover band. Rename it and I *might* give it two stars.
A1CNS7X7NP64JQ	0	1	A predictable teen comedy but with enjoyable ensemble performances. One question: why is Gary Cole (the father) wearing a "Project Greenlight" T-shirt. The movie is not a Miramax product so why the endorsement of the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon project?
A1CNS7X7NP64JQ	1	1	I thought this was the best of the three John Caine mysteries I've read so far. However, I seem to remember reading another novel which also used the emerald flash phenomenon for the same purpose of resolution and philosophic acceptance. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the novel. Can anyone out there help me. I know it also took place in Hawaii.Any information will be more than welcome.
A1CNS7X7NP64JQ	0	0	Don't buy this CD. It doesn't play on my car CD player. The car CD player keeps rejecting it. But at least I can play it on my computer.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	This is the fourth one of these phones I have purchased. Not because the others have broken, but because I have lost a few in our moves.The phones get great reception and are very, very durable and long lasting. I seems other people I know go through a new wireless phone set about every two years and we still have ours from several years ago with little sign of wear. And the feature of listening to your messages from the headset itself (instead of having to stand in the dang kitchen bent over the base)is awesome. I can sit on the couch or in bed and be comfortable. I also find the internal phonebook storage option very handy for storing numbers I call frequently but haven't memorized. Also the speakerphone feature is great and I use it often. I rarely have any problem with sound quality, static, etc. whereas when I go to other people's houses I am usually very aware of their inferior sound quality and reception in their phones...not to be snobby! :)I have had some difficulty locating the features that I needed within the menu but I always find them. That would be the one area I think they could improve on, menu layout or maybe different wording of the features. But still it doesn't affect my 5 star rating.Another feature I love is that you can buy several phones and expand the set up to 5 phones I think. We currently have three with no problems and one of them I bought separately three years later. I HIGHLY recommend these phones.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I found myeslf totally lost in this book for the week and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Gabaldon is an amazing story teller and I cannot wait to start the next one in the series.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I am not an avid romance novel reader, however I really enjoyed this book. The story line was solid and developed enough so that I didn't feel like it was a string of words between love scene after love scene like a few other romance novels I have tried. I had a great time relaxing and reading this book.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I am not an avid romance novel reader, but I really enjoyed this book. I love the Scottish culture and the time period she chose to write in and I loved the characters and story line. Very good book.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I have gone through about 6 night lights and this is the best I think. The things I like:1) The batteries are easily replaced - unlike others that require special batteries from an electronics store.2) The whole neck/light part is adjustable - this is wonderful!! A lot of others don't have this.3) The light has a warmer casting hue - easier on my eyes. Other LEDs I have tried have too blue a hue that ends up being harsh.4) I sit it up on my desk sometimes when I am working late and need a task light (our bed is near my desk & the overhead light would disturb my hubby otherwise)5) The beam is just wide enough to illuminate both pages at a time, unlike others where I had to adjust when moving to the second page of an open book (annoying!)The down sides:1) It's a bit heavy for a paperpack, but I am using it all the same. This isn't a big deal, but it worth mentioning.2) It's a bit bulky so it doesn't pack as well as others I have had - but again this is getting pretty picky.3) The light is on the bright side. Why is this a downside? My main reason for a night light is because my husband goes to bed much earlier than I do. I wish there was another setting that was slightly dimmer, but that is just in an ideal world. :) I just turn the light to shine away from him and it's still bright enough to light up the page.Overall I really like it. The upsides definitely outweigh the downsides and I will definitely be buying another one to have on hand & use as stocking stuffers for our family.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I am 27 years old and pregnant (18 weeks) with my third baby. I used to be a dancer as a child and teenager but since having my first baby 7 years ago I have not worked out regularly AT ALL. I have done a pilates class here and a yoga video there but nothing consistent in the least. I consider myself pretty out of shape (out of breath after climbing 1-2 flights of stairs) and have the physical evidence as well (muffin top, thicker thighs, etc). After a recent leg injury I had a wake up call that working out and taking care of myself was no longer optional (not that it ever was) so have been searching for something I can do while pregnant and after but that won't hurt my knees or back (my weak areas).This DVD came highly, highly recommended by my friend, the workout video guru, as something she has done for a long time even throughout most of her recent pregnancy. She has purchased countless videos and says this is one of the best. So I bought it (even though it's double most other videos) 98% convinced I wouldn't be able to keep up or do it.I just finished my first time through and it was AWESOME!! Each section is incredibly thorough but I never felt exhausted or burnt out, out of breath, dizzy, etc. The target areas were definitely working and often burning and I definitely had to take quick breaks (shhh don't tell) but what I love about Tracy is that she moves along quickly. You are almost never sticking with one move for very long so I wasn't bored and her history of ballet and dance influences her moves so I felt graceful and feminine while toning and getting my butt kicked! The moves she does are so unique! I have taken many dance and exercise classes as a teen and never have I done a lot of what she came up with. It truly is unique.I can definitely see doing this video for a long time. I can't wait to see the results.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	0	1	I bought the model from 2005, but it was so bad I feel it's worth saying here just in case none of this has been fixed:I had done well over 20 hours of research on double strollers. Parly because I am obsessed! :), and partly because I was in search of the "perfect" double stroller. I looked at the McClaren (hated having no snack tray), the Combi Twin Savvy, the Phil & Ted (the one with the second child almost touching the floor and NO basket - are we joking?) Aria Twin, Bob Dualle, Peg Perego Twin Aria, Zooper double and this one. Oh I was given the Graco Duo Glider and can't say enough bad about that one either. Although it's better than this one!!!!I chose this stroller because of all the features, looks, and mainly because I had used my Peg Perego Pilko P3 for almost 3 years and used it every single day and loved it (for the most part).First of all this stroller is heavy, heavy, heavy. And yes friends, this makes a huge difference in your life - especially if you are petite or just don't want to lift a 40 lbs. stroller all the time.I think the biggest problem is that...and get this...you had to UNLOCK and REMOVE EACH SEAT to fold it up!!!! What in god's name were they thinking?? Yes you have to remove the really heavy seat from the "chassis" (metal frame) not once but twice with each seat, (oh and they didn't fold up) put those heavy and bulky things in the car and THEN fold up the huge frame or chassis and put that in too! I thought this wouldn't be a problem but just imagine your children are tired and crying, you are getting them in the car, trying to fold the stroller which takes a long time, someone is honking at you waiting for your parking space....The first time I did this I just burst into tears! Anyway I thought this was the WORST problem with it. Also, on that note it took up THE ENTIRE space of my huge Ford Expedition trunk - and that's WITH the 3rd row of seats folded down!!! And I wasn't about to stack anything on top of an almost $800 stroller, so my trunk was a dedicated stroller holder. Very unpractical.The storage was a joke. The basket may look huge, but it's so shallow! And with the seats in there you actually can't fit hardly anything.It handled so horribley I was going crazy. I could NOT push my 35 lbs. toddler and newborn - let alone try to turn. The handle had this crease where the pieces connect and that would dig into my skin. AHHHH!!!! Nightmare! Even my husband hated pushing it and said to me "I don't care how much, just PLEASE buy another stroller!" I looks like they have improved the handle now, but please test drive this before purchase. Don't order without trying it out!I will say the seats were huge, plush and very nice and I have a huuuge toddler who was quite roomy. The price you pay for that is the weight and bulkiness. The sun shades could not be better and bigger. But that's it! The rest sucked so hard.I could not return it so ate it big time and sold it for a lot less elsewhere. I then bought the BOB Dualle and LOVED it so much. You can read my review on it's page. It served me for 3 years and then I sold it for a good amount and it's still going strong.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	I must start in saying this book's title is very deceiving! It is SO MUCH MORE than a book of curricula reviews. I was starting to stress out a lot at the idea of homeschooling next year even though I am currently a teacher's aide in a private school and have experience! Will I be enough? Will my educaitonal deficiencies translate to my children? Is it possible to retain my sanity while trying to teach 2 school-aged children (different grades) with a baby crawling around too?Through this book and reading other reviews on Amazon and HomeSchoolReview.com I feel so much better. The author really walks you through the whole mental process you didn't even know you needed to go through to even start to consider curriculum choices. I was annoyed at first at all the chapters that preceded the actual 100 Top Choices. But as I started reading and answering her questions I felt calmer and more focused with each passing page.I must warn that one of her exercises has you write out your goals for your children's education - a great idea...but....at the end of that I initially almost started to cry with overwhelm. Not her fault! I was overwhelmed at all that I wanted to accomplish before my children turn 18. Then after a good night sleep (it was late) I looked that list over again and realized my MAIN goals are simple. It's just all the smaller sub-goals that seemed too much to possibly get done. Then I realized that they all aligned with the main couple goals and if I kept those in mind throughout the years it really would be simple. I would just ask myself "is what I am doing aligning or not with my main important goals?" and by that answer I would know if I needed to change or keep going. So in actual fact that was a complete and total turning point in my mothering & teaching career. It sparked a two hour long discussion with my husband and I and was such an incredible moment for us as parents & partners.From a teacher's aide point of view this book has really changed and enhanced my perspective and view of all the different learning styles of children. I really, really see that there is no "right" way to learn (I had a bit of a "right" and "wrong" mindset before I am ashamed to say). It gave me a deeper understanding and compassion for all the "difficult" children I have taught or am teaching right now. I walked into my classroom the next day with a smile on my face ready to be a better teacher. It really is all about what works for the person in front of you. Do they understand it? Are you hearing "Oooh, I get it!!!" several times a day? If not - you are not presenting the information in the right way for that child! So while I am not homeschooling yet, I am teaching and applying these principles.I think Cathy's views and approach to holding your hand and helping you see what will fit your child and you is very unique. Another point to consider is that Cathy is Christian and so her views are stated from that view. I am personally not Christian and I still find her book tremendously helpful and I don't see why other people of other faiths won't love this book too. I also checked her website for a few specific curriculum reviews that weren't in the book (Teach Textbooks!) and found them there! Very helpful.So far (I am sure I will change as I go) we plan to use Sonlight for their Core program (literature, history geography & Bible - we plan to tone down the bible portion and use it from an educational view and use our own religion for teaching doctrine). Sonlight's Science looks appealing - all supplies for experiments come in a box along with a DVD! - but I want to research it a bit more, and their Language arts is also appealing as it ties in with all the Core subjects - literature, history, etc. but again I need more time to decide. We plan to use Steck-Vaughn's Reading Comprehension as part of Language Arts as that's what we are used to and I really like it. We definitely plan to use Teaching Textbbooks for Math (incredible reviews!) but supplement with Modern Curriculum Press workbooks also based on Teach Textbooks reviews saying it can be lacking in some areas & again the children are used to MCP. I haven't decided on Spelling yet. We plan to use Rosetta Stone for Spanish for sure. I also must add that I have used a ton of Frank Schaffer Publications books (and they are black line reproducible too!) with incredible success. So I plan to pick some of these up as well for supplementing where needed. Amazon doesn't seem to have a good selection of these so I will go to our local school supply store. I feel so much calmer, happier and focused as a result of this book! I hope you do too. Thank you to all the Amazon reviewers for taking to time to write positive reviews which lead to my finding this book.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	This book is part of our homeschool curriculum [...] and we absolutely LOVE it. I love all the old stories from other countries and the hidden lesson in each. My children love the colorful characters and the suspense in each one. I hope there are more like it in the years to come. Currently my children are ages 7 & 9.
A1CNYV02J97BE0	1	1	We are homeschooling this year and this book was part of our curriculum from Sonlight.com (which we love!) - and boy are we happy!!! We all loved the little stories about the mischievous but darling boy Little Pear. We are definitely buying the sequel to read because we can't get enough. My children are ages 7 and 9 but I think this book would be fun for ages much younger (4 and up) and even a few years old. It's a wonderful insight into a typical rural Chinese childhood circa early 1900s.
A1CO0GXU2A5EIE	1	1	Love this coupled with the lotion and perfume, but the shower gel scent is strong enough to leave a lasting scent even without the layering.
A1CO0GXU2A5EIE	0	1	Not the best fit, and not the best color. I wear them occasionally but not often. My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles.
A1CO5MA5B93LGP	1	1	If you saw the original Apleseed, you will definitely enjoy its sequel, Ex Machina. The characters are back in unbelievable visual and audio quality. Excellent plot as well; highly enjoyable to any anime/sci-fi fan!Now that HD-DVD is going the way of the dodo, you can get a great deal on this movie if you already own a player.
A1CO5MA5B93LGP	1	1	Outstanding machine. Results are impressive if good, fresh coffee is used. I personally buy my whole-bean coffee at Starbucks and keep it in the freezer; the results beat the original! I have used it intensively for over 2 years (I estimate 700+ uses) with no major problems, except the wearing of the o-rings used to connect the milk container; these require replacement after about 1 year of intensive use. Highly customizable results and ease of maintenance are among its good attributes. Descaling is easy (the machine warns when this is necessary) with hardware store, crystalline citric acid (no need to go for brand-name descaling solutions; they're all the same).Pros:- Unbeatable convenience.- Outstanding coffee (provided you buy quality beans). Much better than steam-pressure machines.- Highly cusomizable results.- Ease of (everyday) maintenance.Cons:- O-rings will require frequent replacement.- Not very good for "American" watered-down coffee. This machine is for espressos, cappuccinos and lattes.- Takes up some noticeable counter space.
A1CO5MA5B93LGP	1	1	I use traditional carbon steel Japanese knives for cooking, as the hard C-Mo steel used in the edge holds a much narrower (sharper) angle than your typical stainless steel knives. This means that a traditional carbon steel knife is unparalleled when it comes to achieving and holding a sharp edge, feeling more like food prep razors than kitchen knives, but you have to take care to constantly wipe them and leave them completely dry or they will rust.As it turns out, Shun can achieve practically the same performance with a stain-resisting steel. This knife has the advantages of both western and traditional Japanese manufacturing: sharp edge and stain resisting materials.Pros:- Sharp, sharp, sharp. Will achieve and, given proper care, maintain a sharper edge than any western knife I have gotten my hands on (Victorinox, Whustoff, ect.)- Beautiful to look at, comfortable to use with its D-shaped handle- Comes with a practical blade sheath, so it can be safely stored in a drawer.Cons:- Made for right-handed users (as Japanese knives for left-handed users are usually made to order). Left-handed use might be a bit awkward.- Expensive. For the price you can buy a traditional Japanese knife (which I still prefer)- This type of knife requires special care. Stropping should be done on a smooth steel or s leather strop (not textured steel, ceramics or diamond-coated). Honing (sharpening) should be done by someone with experience, using whetstones or waterstones. IF YOU CLANK THIS ON AN ELECTRIC SHARPENER, OR USE ONE OF THOSE EASY NO-SKILL SHARPENERS YOU WILL RUIN THE EDGE OF THIS BLADE. I cannot be emphatic enough about this. Those instant or easy sharpeners have a wider preset bevel angle which is designed for softer steels than those used in this blade. They will reduce the performance of this knife to that of a $30 German steel blade.- Also, hard steel is also brittle steel. You will have to learn proper "manners" when handling this knife or it will chip or dull quickly. No dropping carelessly, no sideways scraping with the blade edge, no brute force and always use a proper cutting board. Again, this is a BMW of a knife and should be treated as such.If you do not have the skills and equipment to take care of this blade, please do yourself a favor and (every few months) have sent to a professional Japanese knife sharpening service.
A1CO5MA5B93LGP	1	1	This is the definitive tome for soil mechanics engineering. All of the funtamentals are here, but the book is definitely outdated (edited in the 1960s) when it comes to modern analysis tools and techniques.
A1CO7AHNW10RZS	1	1	I have waited YEARS (since 1972, in fact) for this series to come out on video!!! The production is unsurpassed.
A1CO7AHNW10RZS	1	1	I've been a fan of King Arthur since reading The Once and Future King (T.H. White) decades ago in high school, and have read many, many books both famous and obscure on the subject. As has been noted, there have been many film versions of the Matter of Britain, some definitely better than others.This year for my birthday, I decided to treat myself to this box set. I admit the first episode did alarm me a tad with the amount of bare skin and sex featured. I hoped the show wasn't going to rely extensively on these elements to tell its story. This, however, died down by Ep 2 and IMO this series got better and better as it progressed. By the last couple of eps, I was hooked entirely and severely disappointed to learn that there would be no second season!I really enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower as young Arthur, and Morgan as played by Eva Green--well, she was beyond compare. It was great to see a Morgan who was truly wicked yet whose wickedness was understandable considering her motivation and background. It may not have been right that I was rooting for her to win by the end! But to my mind, Arthur as a character (not to mention Guinevere as a character) was weakened by his involvement in the Arthur/Guinevere/Leontes triangle, which did neither Arthur nor Guinevere any favors and gave each of them a premature history of deception and infidelity long before the expected (and traditional) Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot triangle. Why dilute that dynamic with a "trial run"? I am aware that "triangles" are frequent items in modern tv drama and often done to death. But I found myself getting very impatient with this one, and now when I rewatch, I fast-forward through almost all the Arthur & Guinevere scenes. The nature of their relationship in this version dragged both of them down.I also liked the way this series hinted at Morgan's nunnery "education," mentioned by Sir Thomas Malory in the first pages of the Morte d'Arthur. Sinead Cusack's Sybil was an intriguing original character, and to those who have commented that Vivien was undeveloped, well, I'm sure the show was intending to do more with her as things progressed. It seems to be the trend more often than not lately to make Morgan the daughter rather than the step-daughter of Uther Pendragon, and, considering the way Uther is portrayed in this version, you can't blame her much for bumping him off. Igraine--well, the way she was portrayed, I came away feeling that Morgan's reaction to her (although perhaps not the murder!) was more justified than not. Igraine may have been Arthur's mother, but she seemed pretty ineffectual throughout, and her eleventh-hour claim that she'd saved Morgan's life when Uther wanted to kill her just rang sort of flat.This was also the first role I've ever genuinely enjoyed Joseph Fiennes in, even if, as my daughter said, "This Merlin isn't very 'magical,' is he?" :)At the end of the day, for me, it's All About Morgan. Kudos to Eva Green on a great & complex acting feat of being fascinatingly evil and yet sympathetic, but not too much so due to the choices she made. I'm not sure if those in charge intended her to be as sympathetic as I perceived her to be, or for the "Camelot" people besides Arthur to be so dull, but IMO the "Camelot" residents were pallid in comparison, though Leontes was an effective (largely original) character despite being pivotal in the "triangle."
A1CO7AHNW10RZS	1	1	This book is what I would call a forgotten classic. It is a lighter, longer, more humorous version of the second book of T.H. White's The Once and Future King (The Queen of Air and Darkness). It's been out of print for years, and I was surprised to learn that the audiobook titled: The Witch in the Wood and The Ill-Made Knight (which is the third book of The Once and Future King) was in fact The Queen of Air and Darkness and The Ill-Made Knight. So, not only has WITW been largely forgotten, but now the distinction between it and The Queen of Air and Darkness is also being obscured > lost.So, I figured I'd better get my hands on a second-hand copy before the 1939 (original) version disappeared altogether. Queen Morgause, who is sinister and mysterious in "Queen of Air and Darkness," is chuckle-worthy here--I remember reading long ago that the author modeled her on his own (dysfunctional) mother. This book may not appeal to everyone with its esoteric humor and wacky take on the Arthurian legends, but it is a perennial delight to me. I am so glad to have it in my personal library at last!
A1COJNCBZVGKTQ	1	1	The photo does not really do this pan justice. Wilton has been a leader in cake equipment for as long as I can remember. I bought this pan originally because it was listed as being 2 1//2 inches deep (it's not -it's 2 - I was looking for a lasagna pan.) I was so intrigued with the quality that I decided to keep the pan. It's a sturdy metal with a sleek, non-stick coating on all surfaces. If a pan can be attractive, Wilton did it! The lid fits pretty well - the sides slid over the handles to lock it in place. I baked a cake in it and it's the best non-stick I have ever used. I have an AirBake pan that used to be my favorite - I think this pan will be taking it's place!
A1COJNCBZVGKTQ	1	1	Finding an old-fashioned weather vane that is affordable (most are in the hundreds of dollars) can be like finding a needle in the proverbial haystack. I was glad to find this one. It was easy to assemble. We mounted to a corner deck rail, using a compass to orient it. We've been very pleased. It stays outside year round and we've not had to repaint or maintain it in any way.
A1COJNCBZVGKTQ	1	1	I much prefer mesh cooling racks to the straight wire ones for cooling cookies. Inevitably at least one or two cookies would slip through the cracks and make a mess, something that doesn't happen with mesh. The racks are no harder to clean or to store than the standard "striped" kind. And you can't beat the price at $3 each. The "feet" are fairly deep keeping the rack higher off the table allowing better circulation, which is especially important when cooling cakes.
A1COJNCBZVGKTQ	0	0	Until I read other reviews here, I thought I was alone if feeling worse about myself and my marriage after reading this book. The common stereotype is that women are fragile and hurt by the least little word, but the author's finding seem to suggest the opposite: women can break a man (and even his career) with one comment. Given studies that say that women speak about 4x as much as men, that means policing a lot of what I say. The book for men gave simple, easy to understand instructions of what to say and do and different situations. This book gives vague ideas that I cannot build on - such as the scene from the movie "The Natural" where the woman simply stands up in the bleachers to support her man. Men apparently love this - they love that she didn't talk to him, coddle him, try to kiss it better, she simply stood up and that said how much faith she had in him. The book says women need to do this daily for their man to make him feel valued, but I have not figured out how to implement it. She gives a plethora of negatives examples, so I know never to say offhandedly that my husband has never played golf, might not be suited to race car driving, and I would prefer him not to sky dive. All these statements seem to say to a man he's a failure and his wife does not repect him (which men apparently equate to love.) The title of the second chapter is "You love will never be enough for him." Did I NEED to know this? It's about how no matter how much I love him, his job will define him. His late hours (which I despise) should be lauded, and saying "I wish you were home more, I miss you" is the equivalent of screaming "You are a horrible provider, nothing you do will be good enough for me." She tells me he hears "you're a failure" in every comment I say from "did you bring the mail?" to "did you pick up milk on the way home?". Which is why *I* get blasted -- apparently deservedly -- when he did not do those things. I THINK I am asking a simple question, but what I'm doing is telling him I don't have faith in him, and if he did indeed forget, then I have basically painted failure across his forehead. But if he says, "Did you pick up the dry cleaning?" - it's a question - though maybe he is secretly saying he thinks I'm a failure. I sure feel like one after reading the book. I was hoping for encouragement, concrete ideas on how to make him feel more loved and valued, and instead I walked away feeling like every action and word from me is an attack. The book uses terms like "attack" and "feels like my skin is being flayed off." Wow. Images that make me feel like an abuser. Other women obviously love this book, but I for one cry myself to sleep for failing my husband so badly for 22 years.
A1COJNCBZVGKTQ	1	1	I was surprised how dead-on most of this book is about women and how our minds work. The female co-author is even wise enough to realize that women will read this book and even writes to us in it. (She does not do this in the book for women, which I have also reviewed.) The book explains how women's minds are juggling 7 or 8 different things simulataneously and that we simply can't stop unwanted thoughts and memories from replaying in our minds, even though we wish they would. It also gives men simple, concrete things they can do to combat the difficulties they face in trying to understand a woman's needs. It is a very positive book, written to give a man insight, and give him a game plan to help make the woman in his life feel the love he has for her. Men, if you are looking to understand why your wife/girlfriend reacts the way she does, I would encourage you to read this book and practice it. If you do it without her knowledge, even more brownie points. Ladies, if you guy is telling you he's having a hard time understanding what you want from him, give him this book to read. My husband found it it eye-opening and he's working hard to do the things in it (which are very, very simple) to help me feel the love he already feels for me. A good read for both genders.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	0	How pathetic is my life getting when I'm writing reviews for sink strainers. However this product works great and solved our problem.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This is my favorite kind of movie, scary without the excessive gore or special effects, and the chance it could be true. However, from what I read it seems it is not all factual, but it is still real enough to scare the heck out of you. Hey look, the last "real" movie I saw was "An Inconvient Truth" and I fell asleep four times in that one. The part I liked the best in this movie was the voice captured on the voice recorder, that really made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. If you like scary movies and can restrain from being a film critic and just view it as entertainment, it will be worth watching.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I finally decided to buy a couple of these containers and I'm glad I did. One for dog food, and another for the wild bird seed. No more rolling and unrolling the top of the bag or knocking it over and spilling it. These are sturdy and well built. I debated over getting the standard container with the lid on top, but thankfully I decided on two of the stackable units. It has really helped clear up space in our laundry room where we store the feed.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I've had this album for years and every time I see it I wonder what I am looking at? Is it a pig's ear or a necklace laying on a hairy man's chest? Whatever it is it grosses me out. Oh yeah, the album is a really good Barry White collection of songs.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I love to wear my Ab Sonic while laying on the couch, eating Cheetos and watching COPS. Before long I expect to look just like the guy on the box. I'm not sure, but it seems like when I'm wearing my belt I can faintly smell the scent of bacon frying, is that normal?
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	Very classy, sturdy and easy to mount. (Hey, sounds like my ex wife!) And you don't have to deal with the little spring loaded roller anymore. Looks great next to the matching magazine rack.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I have used several different versions of these over the years and this one has lasted longer and worked better than the rest.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This liner is expensive but fits perfectly in the back of my wife's RX300. There is no cutting or adjustment needed, just take it out of the box and lay it in the back of the car, mission accomplished. The raised lip will protect the car from leaking groceries or dirt and can be easily taken out and hosed off. I should have bought one of these when she first bought the car.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	0	0	I was considering buying this armoire, but after doing some detective work I found that the majority of the 5 star reviews, are those customers only reviews. Very fishy don't you think?
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I don't know about the UV waves but this bulb brings a whole new look to my aquarium. Now it is brighter and all the colors are vibrant. It looks so good that now I have to replace the other bulb to match it.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I put these on a landscaping cart I bought at Home Depot. It's about 10 years old and the tires would no longer hold air or a tube. Instead of buying new tires and tubes I put a pair of these in the old tires and they work great! Unlike some of the reviewers I found it very easy to install by following the directions and using soapy water to get it to slide on. I think it also helped that I let everything lay out in the sun and soften up first. I suspect either they didn't follow the directions or maybe they weren't very handy, as it was really easy for me. (10 minutes). Also, I bought the exact size recommended for the tire. They are perfect for the cart, and I can't see why they would not work on a bike unless you are into hardcore performance. It is nice to not have to worry about air and flats anymore.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	0	The ant bait works well but this is another case where "free shipping" isn't really free. Unless you are home bound save yourself some $$ and buy at Lowes or WalMart or somewhere else.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I am new to dog training but I learned real quick that they will respond much better if they love the treats. Our dog really loves these and they are just the right size for training.The main reason I tried this brand is because it is MADE IN AMERICA. Almost everything else is made in China, and you know their history of using toxic ingredients just to cut expenses. The price is not bad either.Update: The peanut butter and the chicken flavors are great but the salmon flavor will make your dogs breath smell like old bait. We had to drive back from the dog park with the windows rolled down.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	Putting this together required some problem solving skills as the instructions were a little vague when it came to what side is up/down, in/out etc. It also came with plastic dowels instead of wood....first time I've seen those. How much did that save them? Ten cents? Even though it was A.P.I.T.A. to put together it looks pretty good on the wall.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	Just washed the cars and I like it. Seriously, it operates and feels like a quality nozzle but only time will tell if it can hold up.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	0	1	If it wasn't for the hot naked chicks there would not be much of a reason to watch this flick. Just wish the church lady would have got drilled at some point.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	Get a case of beer and invite some buddies over to enjoy some laughs, gore and hot naked babes getting nailed by the sexed up Werewolf/stepdad/stand up comedian.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I bought this to remove the old decal from my Mercury 200 cowling. First I used a blow dryer to peel as much off as I could, then finished it up with this wheel. Like someone else already said, it is like a giant rubber eraser that fits into your drill. I used a DeWalt 18 v cordless drill set on high speed which worked out fine. Then I cleaned up the residue with rubbing alcohol and topped it off by waxing it with a buffer. It ended up better than I expected it would.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This movie is like nothing you have ever seen. Filmed in the Blair Witch style with great acting, believable characters and a very unique subject.The trolls were way better than expected. If you are looking for something different, here it is!
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This is the first I've cooked with wood chips and all I can say is, what a difference! This 3 lb. bag will go a long way and the aroma of the hickory is awesome.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	If you are the type of viewer that needs it all spelled out for you, or seek non stop action move on. This film has great acting, scenery and sound and will stay with you long after you view it.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	0	0	A really basic plot that you've already picked up from the previous reviewers. Slow moving, and honestly seemed very amateurish to me.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	I replaced my old, rusty, squeaky galvanized turbines with a pair of these beauties. They are 100% aluminum so no more rust, permanently lubed sealed ball bearings so no more squeaks and since they are about half the weight, the wind spins them much easier.They also have a LIFETIME guarantee!

A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This tool has thicker wires than the one they sell at Home Depot, which is good because they don't bend out of shape as easy.It really needs to come with a hard case though to protect it from getting beat up.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	This is just what we were looking for, an easy to use coffee maker for two, without all the bells and whistles.It sits neatly on the counter next to the grinder, you just add water and coffee and press on. To me it was well worth the price.
A1COSZMOI965TQ	1	1	The slow pace and subtle plot gives you a chance to appreciate this quirky little film. Just the right amount of special effects to do the job without being overwhelming. I watched it for free on Amazon Prime instant videos so I didn't have any problem with the subtitles like some reviewers complained of.Update:After watching this version twice (Swedish), I obtained a copy of "Let Me In", the American version. The American version is slicker and more professionally done, with more blood and guts, but lacks the quirky, innocent, special something the Swedish film has. If you plan on seeing both films, I recommend you watch the Swedish version first.2nd update:I checked out a copy of the book from my library and just finished reading it. It is a much darker and disturbing story with some really perverted sexual content. Of the three versions, I felt the Swedish film WITH THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL SUBTITLES was by far the best. (If you have Amazon Prime you can watch it for free). As a matter of fact, I liked it so much I even ordered the DVD from Amazon, which their vendor screwed up by sending me the DVD with the messed up subtitles. Amazon was great though, they said sorry, go ahead and keep it and we'll just refund your money.I would rate the different versions like this;Let The Right One In - original Swedish version - PG13Let Me In - American film - R ratedLet Me In - Book - X rated

A1COTDOBRCXUII	1	1	Our family loves this kind of word puzzle. Great for my kids (12 up) sharing a back seat on a car ride. Wish it had more puzzles, they were done in an hour, but we'll bring it out again another day.
A1COTDOBRCXUII	1	1	You might think you have to be a culinary professional to need 6 jars of soup base in your pantry, but you haven't tried Jamison's yet. My kids are carbovores and eat a diet of pasta and rice; I add a spoonful of Jamison's to the cooking liquid. I make soup from leftover meats and vegetables and always make my stock with this product. I have tried other brands when I couldn't find Jamison's, but none compare. When I could no longer find any merchant who carried this, I tried to get my local store to stock it, but had no luck. Once, when travelling, I saw Jamison's Soup Base on a grocery store shelf and grabbed several jars. Not wanting anyone to steal them from my luggage, I put them in my carry-on. Sadly, maddening-ly, airport security called the contents liquid (trust me, it's a powder) and wouldn't let me take it on board. I had to leave it behind. It makes me sad to remember that.I suppose you think that you will not use 6 jars of soup base, but you might, once you see how versatile it is. It will keep for, well, I don't know, but a long time, and the best part is that is will make several times over what a heavy, space-hogging can of chicken broth can produce. (you hate those heavy cans, don't you?)Happy cooking!

A1COXBF5X39XP4	0	1	I ran about 12 cycles on these, and a refresh & analyze on my maha mh-c9000 charger/analyzer. 1000ma/500ma charge/discharge, and got these results, which are the best i've been able to get:1 - 17812 - 13553 - 15124 - 1575They all are also exhibiting high self-discharge out of the pack, which was dated 06/2007 manufacture date. #2 cell is already exhibiting extremely high self-discharge. After sitting for 3 days, I charged them all back up to top off. 3 took 800-900mah, which is about a 40% discharge based on their capacity above. The 4th, cell #2, took 2120mah. This means the cell was mostly drained, IN 3 DAYS!
A1COXBF5X39XP4	0	0	I am a HUGE fan of Deftones previous works. They all had their standout songs, and there were no really horrible tracks.But, there is one factor that has killed this album for me. It seems they have gone completely soft, and have lost that powerful, catchy, melodic, grungy sound they had before in their heavier songs. There are still some heavy songs, but they all just seem to blend together. There are no standouts any more. If they could have kept it up with more classics like My Own Summer, Hexagram, Rickets, Lotion, Feiticeira, Elite, Pink Maggit, or even ones like Digital Bath or Change, then I would still be a fan.If this is what they're evolving into, I think it's time to find a new favorite band. In my opinion, they have lost their edge. Take a little more time on your next album, and maybe you will renew my interest.Also, has anyone noticed the screaming has COMPLETELY changed in this album. For the worse if you ask me. It sounds like he has an rodent stuck in his throat and is choking on it.
A1COXBF5X39XP4	1	1	When I first got these I thought the bass was horribly bloated. There were no mids, and the treble was very muffled. After reading a suggestion on a certain Headphone forum, I pulled the foam inserts out of the earpads. They come out very easily, just pinch the middle of the flat cushion part, and the little round foam insert should come out.Anyway, this made a HUGE difference. The difference was night and day. They are arguably my favorite cans now. The bass thinned out, the mids came alive, and the treble became brighter, but not harsh. I have 6 different pairs of headphones, most of them mid/high end, and I keep coming back to these for their FUN factor. Everything just sounds good on them.My only complaint is an obvious one, The headband! sometimes it's too loose, other times i feel like my ears are going to bleed. Also, the bass output changes depending how they're oriented. If the headband slips down the back of my head, the bass get thinner, if they are centered on my head it's just about right, slightly augmented, which is how I like it.Overall they are a very good buy. The only other cans that have similar bass is my Sennheiser HD212PRO's, but they don't have the saucy mids and crisp clean highs that the AKG's do. The Senns sound somewhat veiled in comparison.Also FWIW, I even use these with a headphone amp when walking every night, sweating all over them. I wipe them with a damp cloth before putting them away, and I haven't had a single problem. The leather ear cushions still look like new. I can't wait to try some of the higher end AKG models.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	0	1	I love historical fiction and have read many that were very good. In the best there is a blending of the authentic history with the modern so that modern audiences will enjoy the result. The idea is to show the hatreds and ignorance of the past, but not give them a fresh life in the modern world. Someone seems to have neglected to tell Sara Douglass this fact.I actually imported the book from the UK to read because it was not published here. After reading it I assumed that it was good judgment that prevented US publishers from putting this dreck out on the market. Obviously I was too generous in my assessment of US publishers. TOR should be ashamed of itself, pedaling this filth for cash. It is also interesting that it is ok to hate and slander women in the name of historical accuracy - but would they have published the book if it accurately portrayed medieval attitudes towards Jewish people -- I don't think so. Why is it ok to hate women for fun and profit ?The main character was filled with hate, for humans, for himself and for women in particular. There were pages and pages of misogyny. Even if this is a true reflection of attitudes at the time, it is not acceptable in a modern work. Especially when there are so many on the net who discuss this book (males) and don't even notice this element - as though it were acceptable, or just part of the warp and weft of entertainment. The real low point of the book is when one of God's angels comes to visit the main character and tells him not to waste time worrying over the pregnant woman he caused to have burned to death, because women should be used for procreation and pleasure and then flushed away like the excrement they are. Now obviously this gives you some pause about what kind of angel he is, but none the less to involve heaven directly in the hatred is repulsive and should never see the light of day. I have not read the other books and have no intention of doing so.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	1	1	I never saw this film in the theatre. I saw it on TV many years ago and was enchanted with the medieval setting. I just recently got the DVD when I remembered the movie due to discussion of the book on an internet board I post on.All I can say is that I am in awe of the work done by the director in bringing the book to the screen. The visuals alone express exactly the sense and the setting that Eco took pages and pages of info dump to allude to.The size of the whole complex with small poorly clad men scuttling over it at the mercy of the weather accurately places man (in the understanding of the time) between cruel and capricious nature (i.e.: godlessness) and being dwarfed by the immense buildings dedicated to god, which represent his power and importance in the world, and the puny stature of man.The dark interiors, lit only by fire highlight the fear, superstition and lack of education and outside contact that the average 'simple' person had. It made real the poverty and the terror and the precarious hold on life the people had, and how they would grasp at anything that promised safety and salvation. How it was so easy to believe in demons, and witches and other physical manifestations of their hard life. The strange look of the monks also represents the difficulty of surviving unscathed by disease, or accident.At the ending of the medieval period the church had grown into a fat, rich, bloated institution more interested in temporal matters, and internal minutia (angels dancing on the head of a pin) than on acting as shepherds to god's flock.The movie shows the Benedictine monks, the caretakers of the monastery and local flock, as those who started with a good heart, yet who uphold the status quo in fear rather than love. Because the times have changed, the flock's needs have multiplied, and the monks have not, they end up going through the motions of the religious life during the day, with venality creeping in during the dark hours: Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, Acquisitiveness, and Selfishness.Rather than copy and disburse books to uplift the darkness they hide them away, and prevent the spread of learning; keeping the knowledge as secret treasure for the select within the monastery. There are gradations of the select within the walls, leaving the monks in competition to become 'more select', rather than focusing on the needs of their flock, and god's work. All they do is dump refuse through their sewer and make the people scramble like animals to survive.This is the setting upon which the future role of the church and god's place in man's affairs is to be debated, in the guise of the question `was Jesus poor? ` Where the regular church people are too afraid of change, and being branded heretics, yet no longer can really believe in the simple answers and rituals of the past, or rely on their superiors for good guidance.The papal delegation, the Dominicans, are rich, fat, and far above the ordinary life of the monks or the 'simple' peasants. They do not wish to give up the wealth, the life of luxury, the ability to satisfy every personal whim, and the temporal power over kings, states, and the simple peasants that the current state of the church bestows on them. Within their ranks is an Inquisitor, the judge, and jury they use to keep any who question them in line, with threats of torture, horrible death, and damnation. They use the Inquisitor to stamp out those who have drunk at the deadly cup of ancient knowledge and who are beginning to question and think for themselves.The Franciscans are the group who represent change, the desire to be free of the trappings of the past, who want to minister to the needs of the people both physical and spiritual and leave power and wealth to Caesar. They are concerned about the good and bad of the knowledge that can lead one to sin, but they are not all the same and not all want the books hidden or destroyed. Some believe that using the reason god gave them, they will find more to worship the creator for. Though their oldest member, Ubertino shows that they come from the same past as the Benedictines.The deaths and murders in the monastery are the outward manifestation of unease, sin, and the breakdown of real belief in the past solutions the church is preaching. Enter William of Baskerville, and his young novice, who represent the coming of the renaissance, the coming of reason, knowledge and enlightenment. They move within the rhythms of the monastery, while staying true to their own beliefs. They try to set the wrongs to right, and move the Benedictines to open their library and disburse the knowledge they hoard, while winning the dispute with the papal legation, and ultimately staying alive. In some they are successful, and in some they are not - much like life.I can't give the movie 5 stars, because too little time and context was set up so that the viewer who had not read the book would understand what the debate stood for, and what the Greek book stood for. Without those clues, the movie seems a lot of to-do about some really trivial matters, yet they are still issues we are struggling with today.This is a movie that you can watch over and over, and pick up and revel in all the details, as well as the wonderful performances. There are some who think Gui, and Salvatore are over the top, but in fact they are needed as they show real human passion escaping from the control of a repressed setting. The sex scene is also needed for the story and really rather beautiful.The movie actually led me to read the book, and I think that those who complain about the movie being different don't understand that the movie must be visual, and that what they think is lacking in the story is mostly presented in the visuals. I agree with the director who said The Name of The Rose is a bestseller which most who purchase don't read, and that if you can read and understand the book, you can also understand and appreciate the movie. The quibble about the ending is really a matter of your preference for the tone, hopeful, or not.The director's commentary and the documentary on the making of the movie are very good, as is the director's photo tour. The music, sets, lighting, and cinematography are magnificent.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	0	0	I heard about this on-line and it looked good. I was intrigued about the hard SF (geology, vulcanology) set on the Moon and in Antarctica. It also blended archeology and the mystery of ancient civilizations with a mystery/thriller that had constructs under the ice and people disappearing. What a wonderful premise. (...)All the characters are described like they are models, or porn-stars and the other characters are evaluating them with an eye to ripping off their clothes and jumping their bones. The main POV character, a woman, is one of the worst offenders and a disgusting stereotype of a women who only goes through life with one aim: trapping her man, while thinking with her anatomy. She acts and dresses like a bimbo, but then she becomes enraged when she garners male attention. Males are bashed as the root of all evil, for both sex, love, and practical matters.Eventually the main character has wild quasi-public sex, and for a bit it seems like the story and the science mystery might gain the upper hand. But that is when more male bashing comes to the fore. The men who aren't bed-boys are arrogant, macho, and blinded by their own stupidity. The main character now has to protect science and scientists from murderous Marines. The mystery does pop up and get interesting again. (...)
A1COYZSZP13T6J	0	0	You know I read this when I was a kid, and I really enjoyed it. I recently had to re-read it for a book group and I almost fell over as I read pages and pages of truly nasty stereotypes. To add insult to injury the story sets up a batterer, a wife-beater as the savior of Pern and the Weyr and the hero of the book.I like the dragons, and the hold/weyr set-up. I like how the people are connected to the dragons. McCaffrey writes well and the story is interesting and the characters mostly well done.The problem is that it is full of nasty cultural/gender stereotypes. I didn't see it as a kid, and I doubt that many kids do today. Sadly McCaffrey didn't see it, but then she is a product of her time. But how can modern adults read this and accept it. How is it possible to read this book and not realize what awful ideas are wrapped up into the story and used to push the plot along, or build tension.The most important dragon is the queen, and yet the leader of the weyr is the male who rides the queen's mate, not the woman who rides the queen. There isn't even any discussion of which one is the better leader, its always the man.The queen and the bronze dragons are the only ones who mate to produce offspring, but there are green, blue and brown dragons who are obviously of mixed sexes because they 'frolic' a lot - but all their riders are male. Why ? Other than the queen's rider all the other women are left at the bottom of the weyr. There they cook, clean, mend, launder, and generally are the drudges who do the housework. Worse they are also a live in harem for the male dragon riders who appear to copulate randomly leaving them to bear and raise the children. But the men and their dragons are too preoccupied with `important' matters to settle down or have families - though of course their urges need to be satisfied.McCaffrey has also set it up so that the substance which produces fire causes sterility, so the queens are sidelined during any emergency. That seems to reflect the old stereotype that girls/women can't actually do anything physical because they will somehow endanger their reproductive organs. Then when the queen's rider comes to the weyr, she automatically decides she is going to have trouble with all the other women in the weyr, before meeting them. Giving life to another stereotype about women not liking or being able to get along with each other.In terms of the actual story Lessa, as a youngster has devised and implemented a plan to hide from, and eventually kill the man who invaded her Hold, and killed her family. She succeeds, but when she ends up at the Weyr they treat her like an idiot. She is expected to do as she is told, to obey all the men. Even F'Lar who knows her worth jumps on the bandwagon. So while the men battle apathy, each other and eventually thread - Lessa has to battle the men on top of all the other things.F'Lar meantime can't keep his hands to himself, and not in a good way. He talks about how their union is basically rape when the dragons aren't mating. But rather than stop having sex, or spend time wooing her, he thinks his skill will eventually bring her around.Whenever he and Lessa argue, and he can't win, or get her to shut-up, he tries to control her by shaking, grabbing, and causing her pain by using his strength to squish her. He is trying to intimidate her, to keep her ideas to herself - as though she has no right to contribute to the running of the weyr or the defense of Pern. As though she has nothing of importance to say. The result of his actions make her unable to stand, or speak, dizzy, sick, bruised and afraid. He is a batterer, a wife-beater who leaves minimal marks. How is it possible that he is the 'hero' of the book, and Lessa who was also beaten by the usurpers in her Hold, never objects to being abused by him. She never connects the two though she fears F'Lar's reactions. By the end of the book they have decided they are in love, and admitted it to each other, so I guess that makes everything alright. But in real life abusers never stop, and once they get away with it they keep escalating their abuse.While McCaffrey had some good ideas and an interesting world, I wish this book could be updated to reflect the notion that women are people too - not just sexual objects who also perform the functions of maid and nanny, and have no other value or interests. I don't expect superwomen, but a nice mix of men and women in various roles who treat each other with respect, even if they do have conflicts, and sexual tension for the plot, is not too much to ask.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	0	0	This book was perhaps doomed from the start. It attempts to cover such a large subject, in a very small, 'popular' history book.It tries to describe the setting which produced the Magna Carta, by spending the first part of the book on life in 1215. The second half of the book focuses on the Magna Carta. Because of space limitations and a tendency to be simplistic and nationalistic-boosters it does neither well. The strange split also means the book lacks a focus or a unifying theme.The fist part is interesting but woefully incomplete. Everything just happens, with no reasons or causes. So the effect is as if you had walked into a room after a big event and all you can see are the ripples left by the event's passing. Why were conditions better, why did the technology level increase in sophistication? What you quickly discover is that if it isn't English, it doesn't exist in this book. So the impact of the Crusades, and the start of the Renaissance, the trade with the east in ideas and every-day items/luxuries gets a line, but is not connected to the changes that happen before and continue in 1215.The second part only presents fragments of the Magna Carta and the supposed reason it was needed, by the history and behavior of King John. No attempt is made to tell why he behaved as he did, or what constraints or motivations acted on him. He is the one-dimensional cartoon baddie of bad B-movies. Not that he wasn't a disaster as King and person, but there are always reasons, and this book ignores them. Because of the fragments you see the events that led up to, and the Magna Carta through a prism. I felt extremely manipulated by the authors, by what they included and what they left out.One of the questions a book of this nature leaves you with, is why, after centuries of being willing to follow a King, (or on a local level the lord, bishop or top dog), in essence a cult-of-personality, the people would suddenly change to wanting rules/laws and having them written down. The book doesn't even come close to answering this question. Mostly because it leaves out the influence of anything outside England, and because it doesn't talk about the change or importation of ideas that changed how people thought.Other biases include the strange adoption of the Anglo-Saxons as the `real' English, and the Normans as just annoying visitors to be absorbed and forgotten. The book is written using the popular belief that the French part of the current English heritage is something to be overcome or survived rather than a blend of what makes up modern England.Finally there is no use of endnotes or footnotes to cite their sources, so you have no way to determine if what they claimed as fact was corroborated by more than one source, or if it was just a one-off that happened to support their point of view. They make many claims, but never offer any proof.This book in essence is the same as the horrid history books that you get in school that survey and simplify everything, without worrying about context, complexity, or competing views or interpretations. It is simply as though one of the paragraphs or chapters of your 7th grade history book has been expanded to fill this book.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	1	1	I just finished this book, which I enjoyed very much. I am astounded to see all the poor reviews. I can't imagine they all read the same book.This is the first book by Zahn that I have read, so I have nothing else to compare it to, or to feel that part of this book is a repeat of any of his other books. I also was not expecting anything heavy or mind blowing. This story is obviously a fun romp melding mystery-on-a-train, space opera, military SF with a bit of noir for flavor. It was a fabulous page turner.The story was quite gripping, with many twists and turns. There was just enough foreshadowing to alert the reader to things not being what they seem, without giving it away. There were layers upon layers of mystery, and good tension between the two main characters.The mystery on a train, was the setting that ran through the whole story. It was well done, not only as transportation from one local to another, but as hideout, and setting of some parts of the adventures. The main characters, humans, meet and interact with many alien species on the train.Besides the main mystery that sets the story in motion, there is the mystery of the Spiders, the Quadrail itself, and what and who the two main characters are, and what other secret aims they are trying to achieve.The Space Opera portion is the many alien species, and the sprawling galactic civilization that connects them all. We meet many aliens, and learn a bit about them as people and about their species. The civilization and how it all works is often discussed, but there are hints of other explanations. Zahn works all the details in without using an infodump, and makes an interesting tapestry.There is also a bit of military SF with commandos and battles, along with the noir. The action moves the story along without overpowering it as some are wont to do.It reminds me of some of CJ Cherryh's early stuff. The writing is good, the story interesting, and the characters are strong. The ending was satisfying, and wrapped the story up, but I would like to see this as the start of a series.
A1COYZSZP13T6J	1	0	I have read the series since the start. I loved the old books, ones where there is a plot, and Anita actually has a life and job. I also preferred the old character of Anita. She was tough, and difficult, whiny and in denial, but she was also fun, and caring, and not so self-centered and self-absorbed. The older books had almost no sex, whereas the recent ones are just badly written mechanical sex.I was not expecting much from this book since the last one was so bad, and the reviews for DM were terrible. In fact I felt I had finally reached the end of my Anita addiction.Since they have gone into HC I tend to get the HC, read it, and then get the PB when it comes out (the first 8 were in PB only). For DM I skipped the HC and only got the PB, and then didn't read it for a year. I heard so many bad reviews.Well I finally read it last weekend, and actually sort of loved it. Its not the Anita of old, and it does have problems but it is so much better than the previous 2-3 books.I have not really liked them since Blue Moon, and feel LKH did things in that book that replaced the real main characters with POD people. Because of the Podding they stopped talking to her, and she has been doing Anita as 'Merry with a Gun' to fill in. Now it seems that some of the real characters are coming back. Of course they have to carry on with the dreck that has built up since they have been AWOL.What I liked:There was less pointless sex overall. The sex scenes that were there, were not so mechanical and soul-less. The whole 'tight, wet, thrusting' theme is just tiring when you read it 20 times a book.There were fewer new characters added than has been the case in the last books.Some of the older characters got more stage time, and more development: Asher in particular. JC wasn't filed away from the action when the sun came up. Richard had some development rather than just angry lines. I like Claudia and her development. We also spent some time with Micah (still hate him) and Nathaniel (still hate him, but he is becoming an actual person). We didn't waste a lot of time with Damian (hate him too), the Were Dr. Lillian was there again.Some of the new/newer characters got development: Remus, Requiem, London, Auggie, Meng Die, Samuel, Sampson, TheaThere was something of a plot, and a continuous thread moving through the book, though it was very light and not something that you can say afterwards that it made a great impression. But it did follow from A to Z while you were reading it.LKH tried to make a story to cover the developments in the book: why Micah and Nathaniel have become so close to Anita so fast. Why everyone (men) seems drawn to her. Why she gets so many new powers, and why she has so many types of Lycanthropy (with hints of more to come). I actually liked using OB's stuff at the end. None of those development were good things, but now at least there is a part of the story to cover it. And I think this may be the first book in a while that AB hasn't gained a new power.I actually enjoy a lot of dialog, and characters talking about thoughts and feelings, so I really enjoyed that.I loved that JC finally got a man, and Anita was there for it, and it turned her on.I liked the Richard developments and the implication that Joseph and the Lions are the self-destructive and dysfunctional result of trying to live as humans and not Weres (what Richard wants to do). I think it will be used in the future to show Richard the fatal folly of trying to be human. He actually seems to be learning and understanding in small bits.There was also an attempt at humor, and while it wasn't the same as the old books, it was at least an attempt.What I didn't like:The whole start of the book, with Ronnie being trashed and turned into a jealous, shrewish, crazy, slut. It also exposed how hard, cold, nasty and selfish Anita has become. I hate that it now happens to any character who doesn't agree/worship Anita, especially the other women characters.I can't say how loudly it comes across that LKH hates women and obviously herself in what she writes in the books. The whole concept of Anita as Prince Charming is just sad and sick.The pregnancy scare was very contrived. LKH used it as a way to say some things, but it was too drawn out and too melodramatic.The anemic plot. First we had Pregnancy Scare, Shopping for a Pomme de Sangre, then it became lets Test Anita around Masters (some from Belles's line, some not, some who had been with the ardeur, some not), then it was Make a Deal with Auggie, then it was Power Plays with Auggie, then the Ballet, and their Bad Behavior.But the ballet part didn't start until the end, and it was over very quickly and easily, and it never made any sense as to what they hoped to gain (given the vampires rules about territories and allowable behaviors and all).The whole thread about Mers got pushed into some future book, the Ballet got almost no stage time.I didn't like a lot of stage time for Micah, Nathaniel, Damien - just kill them all. I hate the 2nd Tri.I didn't like so many characters, and too much time for the new/newish ones. I can't keep track of them (who they are, where they came from, what they are, and what their motivations/issues are), and while some got development, I would rather we had older characters.The ending was a fizzle.Still with all the problems I read the book in about a day and a half, and it is probably one of the few recent ones (since Blue Moon) that I might actually read again.Now of course I am wavering about The Harlequin. I really didn't want to buy it in HC, and now I am not sure if I can wait for the PB. I am not happy with the whole Negative Fan rant, as well as the path the series has taken and feel that I don't want to financially support LKH, so I am trying not to buy the HC. But who knows if I can wait.
A1CP1MJEV3X87S	1	1	Optical cables are pretty basic - either they work or they don't. You can pay a lot for sturdier cables if you plan on bending them around corners or plugging/unplugging them a lot, but otherwise if you get a signal - you'll get sound. The problem I usually run into is that a cable isn't seated properly so I don't get a signal. How great, then, that this cable has a halo ring around each connector that lights up red if the connection is properly seated! I have a cat who is fond of playing with the cables behind the TV, and I can tell immediately that my audio has been unplugged just by looking for the little red light.It's a wonderful addition to the lowly optical cable. This particular cable is on the lower end of shielding/insulation/protection, but I've been using mine for over a year without any problems. Unless you plan on working your cables daily, this is a good buy.
A1CP1MJEV3X87S	0	0	This is a horrible DVD transfer. It's pan and scan, 4:3 format, and it looks like someone taped a VHS presentation on a TV with a digital video camera. The sound is horrible even though it's listed as dolby digital, and the picture quality is terrible.This purchase was a huge disappointment. I loved this movie when it came out, but I've seen better presentation on cable. This DVD is not worth the purchase.
A1CP1MJEV3X87S	1	1	This is a great shelf. Installation is easy if you have a stud finder, and it's only two screws. I left off one star because the included screw heads strip too easily during installation. I had to run out and get replacement bolts to get them in the wall.Once installed, though, this thing is like a rock. I have a receiver and an xBox 360 sitting on it with no problem (see picture)I'm going to buy two more for my family room. For component shelving, it's difficult to beat this shelf at this price.
A1CP6DPJ8OMXPT	1	1	This is definite one of Dream Theater's top five releases - simply put, there are no weak tracks on the album (unlike Black Clouds) and many of the elements which attract Dream Theater fans are present.
A1CP6DPJ8OMXPT	0	0	The worst release of an OST that I have seen - inclusion of too many forgettable 1970s songs...perhaps because the better tracks would have required licensure? The only track of any significance is the Nickleback/Kid Rock cover of Elton John's &#34;Saturday Night&#34;.Do not bother with this album.
A1CP6DPJ8OMXPT	1	1	So much better than the original cast movies I, III, IV, and V; reflects the best of the original series storylines, where an engaging enemy is required - Christopher Plummer is great as Chang, and Kim Cattrall is very convincing as Valeris. If the viewer engages this movie not expecting the stars (pun fully intended), then it works.
A1CPPP8S786S8L	0	0	I really thought this was going to show at least more than a fleeting glimpse at Elvis and the boys, but it's really just a pissed off ex-bass player spouting off at how everything sucks except him. There's not much about "The Singer" or the rest of the band, just Thomas waxing un-poetically about how much better he is than everyone else. Really sad...
A1CPPP8S786S8L	1	1	Season 15 gets off to an awesome start with the Humancentipad episode. A great goof on Apple and the Human Centipede film. After a lackluster Season 14, the boys really pick it up with Funnybot, TMI and the Crack Baby Athletic Association. The last episode (the rumored LAST episode) with Stan thinking everything is s*** is genius as well as hilarious - just the image of the duck and what he "quacks" still makes me laugh as I write this. Cartman discovers AssBurgers to start off the second phase of Season 15 and this batch also includes my favorite - A History Channel Thanksgiving with a great cameo from Natalie Portman: "Ummm...no." All in all a great season - they even rip on themselves with the Broadway Bro Down episode, and considering Trey and Matt were putting The Book of Mormon together at the same time as Season 15 makes it even more remarkable. I gave it 4 out of 5 becasue of the Royal Wedding and Bass to Mouth which are funny, but not really up-to-par. Anyway, I can't wait for the DVD (and those 5 minute commentaries).
A1CPPP8S786S8L	1	1	Goodfellas is great, The Departed is good and The Aviator is fair. But why is Shannon Tweed listed as the star? I notice she is listed as the star for a lot of movies on Amazon, and I don't think she's even in any of them.
A1CPPP8S786S8L	1	1	Why is Shannon Tweed listed as one of the stars of the movie? Was she even born when this film was made?One of the all-time great war movies with an amazing cast led by Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, John Cassavettes and Charles Bronson. Oh, and Shannon Tweed...
A1CPR7AQHUB7A3	1	1	Excellent book! There was science fiction as well as drama - couldn't put the book down! Dean Koontz is fast becoming my favorite author!

A1CPV6X7XG8623	0	1	Ok you already know, this album is full of collabos from Twista to my main girl Keyshia Cole. But this cd sucks. Yeah he got some tight beats to rock in the club to but thats it. My favorite track is LAST NIGHT feat. KEYSHIA COLE, That girl can blow, and thats makes the song tight, not Diddy. And like others have been saying, Yeah Diddy is a great business man and thats it. In my opinion he should just stay behind the scene's. Hang up the rapping Diddy, cause you are not it.
A1CPVGBTIM5YVF	1	1	Neither creationism nor evolution can be proven by the scientific method, a point which is clearly made in this book. The scientific method deals solely with repeatable experiments. Since history is not repeatable, the scientific method cannot prove or disprove either the Theory of Creation or the Theory of Evolution. All science can do with regard to origins is to assemble evidence which seems to support one theory or the other. Of course, when it comes to questions of religion, human beings tend to make enormous suppositions and present them as fact. This is true of both the Judaio/Christian religion and the secular humanist religion.This book is a good examination of the scientific evidence and observations which can be interpreted as support for the Biblical account of history. It should be read by Creationists and Evolutionists alike.
A1CPVGBTIM5YVF	0	0	I picked up this book believing it be a diary, or at least based on a diary, of a young woman in Nebraska in the 1880's - which is what the cover proclaims it to be. It is in fact poorly written fiction. Neither the style of writing nor the actions and thoughts of the main character, or the other characters, are remotely authentic. There are a few historical details thrown in which give it an air of historical authenticity - enough to make a child believe it was an accurate account, but ascribing 21st century motivations and attitudes to a 19th century character.

A1CQBSCOOUMLUJ	1	1	Well written and accurate novel of WWII. Not quite as good as To the Last Man [WWI] but all his novels are excellent and should be read in highschool and college history classes.

A1CQPQZQRJMJV3	0	1	WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! The transfer quality of this DVD "SECRET AGENT" is discusting. This is the 21st century, the digital age. With the latest transfer machines on the market there are no excuses for studio's churning out rotten transfers. Before you buy this disc, ask yourself if you can sit through an unwatchable image. Good old "Hitch" would turn in his grave if he knew what was happening to his precious movies. A warning should be posted about the rotten transfer of this disc and I have just done it! DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!
A1CQPQZQRJMJV3	1	1	My only concern when purchasing this wonderfully funny movie, was going to be, "How is the picture quality?" I am happy to report that the quality of vision and audio is perfect and very typical of the good old three strip Technicolor. Although this was an MGM release, Warner have been reponsible for this great transfer, so those that have a video projector and a 10ft screen, can see it as I saw it presented in the movie houses in 1951. Thanks Amazon, MGM and Warner, I was happy to part with my cash for this one.Brian MuhlingWestern Australia
A1CQPQZQRJMJV3	1	1	Thank you Mr. Warner for seasons one and two of Cheyenne. Would you please get a wriggle on and release season three before I die?
A1CQPQZQRJMJV3	1	0	BARBARELLA: The product specs above, quotes the screen ratio of the Blue-ray version that is about to be released as 1.85:1. I hope this is incorrect as this masterpiece of campy science fantasy was shot at 2.35:1 and the version I have on DVD is from a poor quality (scratched and dirt marked) projection print. Any body know any different? Please speak up.Brian
A1CQY2NKYOLXL4	0	0	FOrtunately I didnt spend money buying this drivvel, but i was trapped at my boring cousins house for thanksgiving, and found a copy of this book, and thought "wow, now theres something i can enjoy less than the company of my annoying relatives".I was right. This book is so jam packed full of historical innacuracies and eronious conclusions that its laughable. You'd really have to be a mindless moron not to spot the flaws in his arguments. Not to mention he's been fingered for reveiwing himself under false names.Al Franken's book is pretty much bang on, this guy is a paid mouthpeice for the Republican party. Pretending to be a jounalist. He makes out like hes a nice fella, looking out for us.Dont be fooled, this is PROPAGANDA.
A1CQY2NKYOLXL4	1	0	I remmeber this book was the most amazing tale when i was a kid. I read it recently, and i was a bit taken aback by how easy it was to fly through. Maybe its a bit Harry Potteresque. For a kid, the characters jump out of the pages and take you into the world with them. I dont think ive ever been as encapsulated in a story ever again. I remmeber at the end of the 3rd book crying and crying because i felt all my freinds had just died. Sad eh?The one disturbing this i heard was the authors are Mormons, and the stuff about &quot;the true gods&quot; is them trying to push their religion is a kind of abstract way.This may also be complete rubbish.Anyway, i couldnt bring myslef to give it anything but 5 stars, as it pretty much was the defining series of my childhood.
A1CQY2NKYOLXL4	0	0	i got this clock for my wife, who's grumpy as hell if she gets woken up suddenly. When i unwrapped it, it seemed a bit cheaply made, but i thought &quot;its the non-grumpy wife that matters&quot;.Unfortunately, before the relaxing sounds start (short loops that make the whole thing vibrate), the thing makes a loud buzz. BWARP! And im an idiot because i threw the packaging away, so i cant return it. So my wife (whos grumpy a lot now) reminds me costantly.
A1CQY2NKYOLXL4	0	1	If you are serious about reading this book, I would strongly reccommend reading David Ray Griffins book at the same time. It shows this report to be a completely politically motivated whitewash. If you havent got the patience for this, then just google "loose change" and watch the video (second edition is better). This is a first step towards the truth.

A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	0	0	Honestly I can see why this movie bombed back in the eighties when it was released! I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers are living on , it is boring, cheesey effects and the claymation is second rate! Disney could have and should have done a lot better with this release, and I am sure they know it! I had a good laugh after watching this movie thinking back how some people said in their reviews "not for children" Come on!!!! Geez, I thought the old version of Wizard of Oz had some scenes in it that were waaayyy creepier than any of this movie! Do not be deceived by these ridiculous four and five star ratings, it rates two stars at best!!!
A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	1	1	I have to say I was so excited to see that all 14 Rathbone and Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies were remastered and made available!! These are classic must see gems!!! Pearl of Death is one of the better films.
A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	1	1	What more can be said, yet another great Hammer film starring Peter Cushing.IMO you cannot ask for anything more ,lavish and magnificent sets, the bold colours and the characters are all fantastic!!!
A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	1	1	The Erevis Cale trilogy IMO is one of the best and most entertaining books in the Forgotten Realms! Loved it!
A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	1	0	I agree with most of the reviewers, this is a very entertaining book. However my only disappointment with this book was the reason's behind why the true villian became nasty and evil. It was lame and quite comical. Overall a good read.
A1CQZ2CKPYXC23	1	1	I found this Rogue's book to be just as entertaining as the other 3 books. Whether or not Tazi should not be a rogue is irrelevent, I liked it . I hope there will be more Rogues books in this series.
A1CR4I6I27MHP	1	1	This game is excellent! Spy Hunter has the perfect mix driving and shooting. One of my big complaints about most games is that they are either too easy (you become board quickly) or too difficult(you get frustrated and quit), but this game is PERFECT it is challenging to keep you interested, but it is not so difficult that it becomes frustrating. If you fail a mission several times you really enjoy playing the same level over as you attempt to complete the mission rather than it becoming monotonous. The levels are really well designed and fun to drive/shoot your way through. To clarify this is the most fun PS2 I have played yet!
A1CR4I6I27MHP	0	0	I am sorry, I have seen this movie three times, including recently in it's &quot;restored glory&quot; (mostly because I have been subjected to pressure from friends who keep claiming this is one of the greatest films ever made). I can see and appriciate a uniquiness in the visuals and story that this film has, but it completely fails to grip me. This movie seems to be too long, too redundant/monotonous, to bill this as a De Niro movie is a false advertising, and Pryce is more compelling selling luxury cars. Maybe because I am a huge Monty Python and Robert De Niro fan I have never been able to look at this movie properly. Sorry, but this movie just doesn't cut it for me.
A1CR4WCJXECCH	0	0	This movie is completely screwed up. Not a kids movie at all. From evil people with buttons as eyes, naked obese creepy old ladies (boobs are like watermelons and naked with tassel covering the nipples), just about any creepy and screwed up thing for a little kid that you can think of. Coraline's character is likable, but the movie ruins it. You're kid will watch it because it's psycho but I definitely do not recommend.
A1CR4WCJXECCH	1	1	This is an excellent book into this woman's experience. It touches upon many things and her journey is amazing and personally, it has helped answer a lot of questions I have had about life. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be inspired and know that we are not alone in this life and there is something wonderful waiting for us in the next. Excellent book!
A1CR9FH5YWUZMJ	0	0	The pans are not Farberware quality. Cheap handles, Cheap nonstick material, and Cheap price. The price is right, but the quality is poor. Not a bad pan for the price. If you want a good Farberware pan spend a little more and get better quality.
A1CR9FH5YWUZMJ	0	1	Ordered the KitchenAid Slow Cooker as an addition to our KitchenAid counter top collection. Sure, I read the reviews, but I knew KitchenAid had a great reputation. I've not had any problems with my other KitchenAid appliances. Two weeks later I knew I was in trouble. I heard loud pops from the kitchen and sure enough the ceramic pot had cracked. A review of the KitchenAid forums supported my experience. Many other loyal KitchenAid consumers had identical experiences. Not only had they experienced the same problem, KitchenAid apparently began blaming consumers for the problem or denying that the appliance had problems. Sure they would honor their year guarantee, by replacing the ceramic pot. In one instance a consumer had hers replaced several times. Apparently, KitchenAid has comprised their quality control on this appliance. This is not what I would expect from a company that I had held high in regard. Consumers who are considering purchasing this appliance should review the KitchenAid consumer forums for this slow cooker. Amazon honored their return policy and I requested a refund.

A1CRIL19I14SOA	1	1	I had a Nokia 3595 before and it was a lot simpler to use. But this sony ericsson has a lot new features that I never had, like the camera, internet, and instant messaging (all of which i don't use.)I was going to buy the t616 but it was more expensive than this one. I think the t616 is more aesthetically appealing, but this phone is slightly smaller.I got this phone because I wanted something with Bluetooth to sync with my Apple Powerbook's Address book. This phone did the job, but it doesn't let you store that many phone numbers per person. Like for a few people I had over 5 numbers for them (Work, College, Home, Weekend home, etc...) and the phone only keeps 3 and ditches the rest. =/I agree with the other guy who said the default ringtones are strange, they are! But thanks to bluetooth, you can easily download new ones and themes as well onto your computer and then transfer them to your computer. And you don't have to pay extra for these.I miss my nokia, but I gave this a four because bluetooth just rocks. It's more confusing as first, but you get used to it pretty quick.MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT - however - is that it's NOT loud. [I have turned off increasing ring, volume @ loudest] My nokia was VERY loud and I could hear it ring when I'm in the middle of city and there's traffic, buses, and whatnot blaring their horns. Also, the vibrations are not as strong as the Nokia's. I can barely feel it in my pocket vibrating.I also work at a computer and my ears are plugged into my ipod. I rely on my phone to be loud, but it's not. =/Oh well, other than that, it's a GREAT phone :)
A1CRIL19I14SOA	0	1	The book is actually rather short, less than 200 pages. But the book might have been better received by me if it were an article. First off, Bartov includes too many sources and excerpts most of which demonstrate the same point, over and over. Additionally most of the excerpts were not necessarily of exception quality, which meant the reader reads account after account of the same type of entries about ideology or the horror of war. At one point, it was just better to read only one excerpt and skip the rest.Bartov also just simply doesn't convince me of his thesis. In the last three chapters, there were so many excerpts I simply forgot what he was trying to prove. And when he did go back to his ideas, he would suddenly make, in my opinion, great leaps of logic. After a few excepts he might say something like, that demonstrated that the soldiers were completely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology. Well, I'm not so convinced because even though they were fed propaganda, who is to say they didn't already have their predispositions and prejudices against "jewish bolschevism," before joining the army, and more importantly, before Hitler even came to power? He also concludes at the end that the Germans removed themselves from hitler and made themselves victims and that, so-to-speak, "others" committed the crimes of WWII, whether it be on the east front or Holocaust. Regardless of whether or not that's true, the conclusion came seemingly out of nowhere and I have a hard time believing his statement, because he doesn't explain it. He doesn't explain how they remove themselves, etc.Lastly, this is probably just a pet peeve, but I hate how random german words pop up in excerpts and in the text that aren't translated, but others are. He talks about an author having heard a veteran in a "german Kneipe," but didn't bother translating it to bar. Or in my translated texts, he leaves some german phrases in brackets. I just find it redundant and at the very least, inconsistent.The first chapter, however, is a rather good description of "demodernization on the front," and worth reading. The rest of it is rather, mediocre.

A1CS3ECDKNT9RU	1	1	Ibn Al-Rawandi ...died more than a thousand years ago. Ibn Al-Rawandi the author of this book lives today, As a matter of fact he dedicated the book to his mother 1903-, and inside the book he discussed the views of modern - twentieth century - thinkers as P. Crone and M. Cook who published a book together 1980's, and probably the author assumed the alias Ibn Al-rawandi for himself. To clear the Matter to the reader I add the following two notes:Ibn Al-Rawandi( 9th century):The moslem notion that the Koran, no one can produce like it and also - this came later by moslem theoligians - the Koran is as eternal as Allah itself and therefore was not created. was rejected by Nazzam a famous reasonable moslem theologian who was by no means secular. Nazzam saw that notion is damaging to islam especially among the intellectuals, so he said that the Arabs contemporary of Mohammad were able to write like Koran. But he then maintained that Allah stopped the Arabs from doing so as a proof to his prophet. This last statement by Nazzam is not strictly true, for some Arab contemporary to the prophet Mohammad did compose like Koran and their works was destroyed when Islam became dominant. These Statement by Nazzam that the Arab were able to produce like Koran - as the head of Arabic literatures Taha Hussein said in his Phd thesis - caused a great impact on Moslem free thinkers as Ibn Al-Rawandi and Abul-Ala Al Muary who wrote books challenging the Koran. Muary wrote a 4 volumes books in the same pattern as Koran, 3 were lost or destroyed and only the first volume survived. Although Muary and Rawandi shared the same views about religion, Rawandi was hedonist a wine drinker, Muary wasn't, he was strictly vegetarian never married wished if the human race perished from the earth even in one poem he gave the wolf a nobel position than man. Muary came after Rawandi and attacked him for his hedonismm but there is an important point about Muary which even today great sholars have not noticed, Muary was believing in many of the things h's criticizing Rawandi ofIbn Al-Rawandi (Today), the BookThe book is very great, terse and compact. The author tried to be exact and offered the views of many modern researchers. It will appeal to the neutral objective reader who seekd the Truth about Isalm
A1CS3ECDKNT9RU	0	0	1- The assertion that the apparent incoherence of the Koran is due to the assumption that the pouring of the heavenly Koran (The uncreated Koran) into the earthly Koran represented by the Arabic language was like pushing a thousand Truths into dozens of alphabets and had to result in such incoherence and anachronism, is not only laughable to the secular mind but also offensive to the orthodox scholar Muslims. Hey perhaps the immense Energy-Momentum Tensor associated with the huge satellite transmition resulted in Riemann-Christoffle tensor that caused such space time warp2-The saying that Islam resulted in science movement is rather a historical mistake. At the time of Caliph Ummar when Egypt was conquered, he ordered his appointed governor to burn the Library of Alexandria on the ground that it was either contradicting the book of Allah { Koran ) or superflous to it. And As the historian Well noted (in his book short history of the world), it was only until the notion of the self-sufficiency in the Koran was set aside that Science started to flourish in the Arab empire. Indeed it was the caliph Maamoon who adopte the view that the Koran is just words any Arab can write the like thereof. Maamoon put obnoxious fundamenal shieks - insisting that Koran un created - in jails. Mammon enocurage Sience gave the jewish translators gold in weigh of what they translated from Greek to Arabic. Al-Khwarizmi,who gave Algebra its name, was a close friend to Maamon.3- About the right of Women in Islam, that is also another misleading in the book. Of all the enemy and critic of Islam write, there is an incident no one - up to my kwoledge - has yet written about. Here is it: If man accuse another man or a woman of adultery and cannot bring another three acceptable 3 men witnesses , he must be lashed 80 times. However a husband can accuse his wife of adultery even if he cannot produce another three acceptable men witnesses. He just has to swear five times that she commited the act. Now she either addmit and face punishments or deny and swear five times that she didn't and he is lying :"And for those who launch a charge against their wives, and have (in support) no evidence but their own,- let one of them testify four times by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth; "And the fifth (oath) (should be) that he solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on himself if he tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth." 24:6-9 Koran Yousef Ali translation. The drama does not end here. after the divorce the man can go and get marriage. The woman NOT. According to the Islamic legislation, she must wait until Alah shows a sigen that her huband was lying. The sigen could be as a disease that hits him...etc. Of course that doesn't happen in islamic society today.4- The author also try to accomodate that the Koran and the Bible are both right. If two things are contradicting, only two conclusion are possible: 1-) One is false 2-) Both are false. An Arab poet, Al-Maary, who was 300 years after Muhammad, once said:Corruption is people's first natureAnd in hallucination all religions are equal
A1CS3ECDKNT9RU	1	0	It is obvious from this book that the Author is in toutch with Arab predicaments and delimmas. The Arab would choose to stay behind and welter in poverty and humilation rather than to become a prosperours intellectual secular nation. But what realy got my attention in this book is something interesting about the former Afghany islamic fundamentalist regime, the Taliban. Regarding the punishment of homosexual sinners, the author mention that the Taliban couldnot find a decisive islamic punishment, so they mad up their own - until Muslim Ulma agree on some punishment.- Actually The Koran itself discuss this matter. Let's first look at these Koranic verse :"15. If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way. 16. If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful." 4:15-16 Yousif Aly Translations. Acctually Mr. Aly translations in verse 16 - "punish them both. " is untrue and does not represent the original Arabic which could be better represented by the English "rebuke them both", which means the punishment can be even as mild as just verbally in case of male homosexual. The case of Lesbian is far severer - death - and also ambiguous - Allah ordain for them some (other) way. - Therefore it seems that the Taliban - and also, strang enough but True , most islamic fundamentalist Orthodox - would choose to violate the Koran than to present it as weak on its punishment of homosexuals.There are some errors in the book, which realy do not affect the book's subject, but the critics of the author may hold it to attack the book. For example as the author mentions: the custodian of Muhammed after his mother's death was Muhammed maternal grand father. Acctually it was his paternal grand father. But as I mentioned that has no count regarding the theme of the book and its bright presentation

Your Christianity was fundamentally based on Jewish deicide yet your Pope whom no one knows if he is among the dead or the living did exonerate your Masters of manipulation from it. And if you use just relative fair common senses, who are the terrorists? People of Iraq - The honorable Sunni people of Iraq - who are defending their country and their resources from a vicious tyrant ruthless, the Anglo-American Wolf, your administration who lied to the whole world in order to rape Iraq's Oil. Go back Craig and look to your very ancestors. Hell to all of them including your so-called founding fathers. It is the same route you have been travelling killing people first you called red Indians and then you call them Native Americans. And then you have the audacity to preach democracy and human rights.

A1CS8PCTZ8BXQA	1	1	The late Pierre Brichard was one of the very first exporters of African cichlids, especially those of Lake Tanganyika, as well as an avid photographer of them. He discovered numerous species, and several fish species are named for him (including Teleogramma brichardi, Synodontis brichardi, and Neolamprologus brichardi, &quot;the fairy of Burundi&quot;).This book was his major literary work.It bears some of the sloppy editing that is so typical of TFH publications, and in some ways it is quite dated by now, but still, if you're interested in Tanganyikan fishes, you've really got to have this book. There is no substitute.
A1CS8PCTZ8BXQA	1	1	This album is simply a wonder. It contains a few great songs and several more good ones. Joan Osbourne's voice is miraculously good on every cut. The instrumentation and backup musicians are also fantastic. If you don't have it, buy it right now!
A1CS8PCTZ8BXQA	0	1	In my opinion, this magazine used to be better than it is now.I stopped subscribing when it got to the point that the great majority of articles were clearly written for rank beginners and very repetitive of other articles in recent issues. I don't need to read yet another article on how to take care of guppies or explaining what a barb is.Also, as with most hobby magazines, there isn't much copy editing or fact-checking.Another beef I have about this and most other aquarium mags is that a large proportion of the articles are about tropical reef organisms and reef aquarium issues, when keepers of reef or other marine tanks are only a small percentage of aquarists. They, and we, would be better served by moving this material to specialized salt-water publications.On the other hand, Aquarium Fish does still have some good writers on certain topics. You just have to wade through a lot of repetition of basic information to find them.
A1CSAJ2POH2M08	0	0	This is about the 3rd novel in the chic lit genre that I've read in recent years and each has been worse than the one before. I keep having this sense that there'll be one I'll really like. I sense that I'll enjoy relating to a woman like myself in a parallel version of reality, even if it doesn't match well with this one because even though the heroine works in publishing or some similar industry she can afford Manalo Blaniks (sp?) and such. But every time I'm disappointed at how not only unrealistic but also shallow these are. And they're not funny on top of that!This one was the worst so far, as I mentioned. The hook from the book's jacket seemed to be that it was about an overweight heroine who is happy with herself nonetheless. But like so much of what's out there in women's culture, she only finds real happiness when she loses the weight.I know chic lit is about fantasy and escapism, so I'm willing to give the absurd love affair with a movie star aspect of the plot a pass, but I really wished that I'd be impressed with our heroine's supposed wit and other lovable qualities. I never found her jokes or wise cracks funny. And I didn't find her smart or her columns (which appear as vignettes throughout the novel) insightful. In fact, if you haven't had your head buried in the sand for the last few decades, you already know everything about dieting that this so-called science writer reports.I'm going to agree with another reviewer who said "don't bother." I'm sure there's good chic lit out there but this certainly isn't it.
A1CSAJ2POH2M08	1	1	This book is great fun. If you know more than a little about rock history and have a good sense of humor about it, you'll probably like this. It might not be as good for people unfamiliar with rock history, however. I was glad I had read Please Kill Me, the 70's NY punk scene book, a few years back because otherwise I would have missed a lot of the references. I probably didn't get a lot of jokes about Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.This book is the fictional biography of legendary rock critic and guru Neal Pollack, written by a younger, highly gentrified critic who knew him. Pollack just happens to create and then destroy every rock legend from Elvis to Cobaine. Pollack is the author's representation of the spirit of rock n roll, and I think it's a fine one. He is raw, angry, smelly rebellion incarnate-- for better or for worse.
A1CSAJ2POH2M08	1	1	I don't have much to add to the numerous other favorable reviews here, but I did want to give it the 5 stars. I enjoyed this novel immensely. I read it in one day. The characters were real, well-developed, and easy to care about. The story, too, is touching but not so drenched with sentimentality that it veers into melodrama. The main plot and the sub plots merge gracefully at the end into a very satisfying conclusion. Kingsolver has given us an excellent read here.
A1CSAJ2POH2M08	1	1	This is a story that is familiar to many women who struggle with their weight. The title says it all. We're given conflicting messages in our culture: on one hand we are told to love ourselves and have healthy self esteem no matter who we are or what we look like and on the other hand there are standards of beauty that are very hard to reach in a culture that is rife with affordable, high-calorie foods. Really there is a constellation of issues that we all (men and women) face around the weight issue, but Wendy tells the story in a way that really hits home for women. If you've spent a lifetime working on building a persona based on your heart and brains, how do you then justify a time-consuming and sometimes expensive campaign to change your body when for so long you have claimed to yourself and others that that's not what you're about.Since reading this memoir I've become a Wendy fan. She's smart and likeable and witty and the articles I've read by her since reading the book are some great pieces of writing. I'm Not the New Me is not for everyone. If you haven't had these types of issues you probably can't relate and won't enjoy this book so much as those of us who have. But, Wendy's writing seems to be getting even better as I follow her articles and I bet we'll see some really great stuff from her in the future that will entertain a broader audience.
A1CSAJ2POH2M08	1	1	JS has a very pretty if rather small voice. Her lyrics are smart and different. Songs are catchy. I'm surprised none of the tracks from Pink Pearl were hits. She's a good singer-songwriter who deserves more recognition. Check her out.
A1CSKKTDNT13BD	0	0	I bought these to replace the bulbs for my under cabinet lights I purchased at Home Depot. I made sure they were G8 base and then purchased these on Amazon. When I received them I tried to install them into the light base but the prongs were super long and wouldn't work. So basically the 8 bulbs I purchased were useless.I can't comment on the quality and longevity of the bulb as they weren't the right size bulbs. Back to Home Depot for the correct bulbs that only last for 2-3 months. Oh well.
A1CSKKTDNT13BD	0	0	This watch had everything I was looking for. A nice big clock read-out, day, date, and most importantly solar and atomic time keeping. Where this watch went wrong for me was with the band itself.After recently purchasing the G-Shock Riseman, I thought I would return it and get this watch instead, hoping I would recoup half of the money I had spent on the Risemen. The only reason I was looking to do the return was because I didn't need, nor planned on using any of the features on the Riseman other than the time and date.Unfortunately, the band on the GW700A is very, very uncomfortable for me compared to the Risemen. The band is almost like a hard plastic rather than a soft comfortable rubber. I couldn't stand wearing it for more than 10 minutes before I had to take it off.Sadly, it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. I really wanted to like this watch but I guess I'll just keep the Risemen as it wears very comfortable.
A1CSKKTDNT13BD	1	1	I first purchased the G Gauge Polar Express Train set and set it up so my kids could control it around the track. I found the trains on that set to be extremely light and made of plastic. The unit worked on batteries and had a wireless controller. I was looking for a nice train set that could be used once a year around the tree and then put away till the following year. After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase the O Gauge.These trains mimic the old Lionel trains my dad had as a kid. The power transformer, though plastic, still operated very similar to the metal one my father has. The Engine is heavy and made of medal. Though the train cars are made of plastic, they light up when the train glides on the track. The track itself is electrified to run the train and the train lights. They are a heavier duty plastic with metal rails.I am glad I invested the money and purchased the O Gauge as I am confident it will hold up for years to come every Christmas.
A1CSKKTDNT13BD	1	1	I bought this in November 2011 and I just sharpened my chain the other day. I can't rave enough about this sharpener. Compared to some other reviews out there, this thing has yet to fail. It's very easy to setup and use and it works great. I live on a 2 acre wooded lot and after Hurricane Sandy, I needed to put my chainsaw to use. I constantly sharpened my chain and it worked every time. Buy this if you can find it still, you won't be disappointed.
A1CTK3OWNSFUYR	1	1	This album is great fun... I don't know why, but it is! I borrowed it from a friend in high school and been hooked ever since. There is just something about a theme band that doesn't take itself too seriously. The song "Brain in a Jar" pops into my head at least once a week. Always followed by "Little Green Men". I was was going to purchase a used copy but, in the hopes that some of my money may see the band I opted for a digital download and hope you do the same. I really regret never getting to see them perform liv... Gotta go! Download has completed! If you really wanna see what I'm talking about, check 'em out on myspace [...]ThanksWade
A1CTK3OWNSFUYR	1	1	I purchased these for my 1994 Honda Accord and they fit just fine. I am running them on all stock gear (Lugs, Nuts, Rims, and Hubcaps) just to make the wheel base a 1/2" wider. No problems as of yet. I was worried that I would run short on the stud but I was able to get 7 to 8 turns in before they snugged up. This is just enough to sufficiently keep them(nuts)in place. My only advice is make sure you center them on the hub or you will feel a vibration when driving and this is as thick as you can go on stock studs. If your running "rims" then you will probably NEED to install longer studs. Please be safe!ThanksWade
A1CTK3OWNSFUYR	0	1	Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? It sucks... It sucks So Hard...
A1CTK3OWNSFUYR	1	1	I love the movie cars and I have owned it since the day it was released. I am also a huge fan of Jeremy Clarkson's work (Top Gear and such). I was quite surprised to learn that the UK version of this film is exactly the same as the US version, with one exception. Clarkson voices "Harv". It is true and wonderful! Thank you amazon, the interwebs and the UK... great combo!
A1CTR95FUBE09R	1	1	This is probably on of the better green day albums. If you are into pop-punk or whatever the genre is called nowadays, you will probably like this. That being said after reading most of the reviews aboust this album, I've come to relize that these reviews mean nothing. Just some friendly advice to the people that are on here to purely hate on music. If you are not a muscician you have no right to tell someone they suck especiall when said band sells as many records as green day has because apparently they don't. Making music is harder that it looks. Just playing an instrument well doesnt make you a good musician. Creativity does. The whole recording process also is not an easy one. And to all the people here to glorify their favorite band or whatever. Please rethink your review. no one give a care if you think Billie Joe is hot. really also saying green day has really good instruments also isnt a real smart thing to do. They play punk music instuments are normally not good in punk. It is what it is. simple songs with catchy hooks. If you don't care for the genre than you have no business buying and or reviewing this album. No disresect to anyone.
A1CTR95FUBE09R	0	1	Okay first off atreyu is awesome, i love the band. Seriously though, a best off. They have 3 albums and and ep out. Now the music on here is good but it's missing a few tracks. For instance Rememberance Ballad, Shameful, and My fork in the road(your knife in my back). This is clearly a Victory records idea to get as much money from the Atreyu brand while they can. and what better way than exploiting the catalogue of songs then a best of album.
A1CTSCGQAFUDVS	1	1	I love this headset as this is the first bluetooth device that made me feel the bluetooth technology works.I used to own Scala headset with Sony Ericsson 610, I had so many issues with it after few weeks that I had to delete the device and reassociate the device before every use. What a pain in the neck.This headset is excellent. If my Sony Ericsson phone (Z520a) has bluetooth on, this one automatically associates itself with the phone without any issues. I love when I can transfer from handset mode to bluetooth seamlessly.Also, the battery seems to last for several days and charging is pretty fast.Love it.. a little pricey but definitely worth the price.11/27/07 - Sorry about disappointing.. The product did not work suddenly with any device.
A1CTSCGQAFUDVS	1	1	Pros:Phoenominal energy drink has a magical energy effectNo palpitation effect like RedBull or other energy drinksCompletely natural and has interesting ingredients that you find in your green teaNot very sweet at allCons:One minor aspect was that I had to get used to the taste as it is different.
A1CTSCGQAFUDVS	1	0	Pros:Excellent size to hold 12 cupsCarafe can be heated to keep the temperature perfectCompletely programmable so that the coffee is ready when you wake upAutomatic switch off if you forget to turn off while you rush to workCons:A little awkward in the beginning to fill the water but got used to it eventually.
A1CTSCGQAFUDVS	1	1	I generally hate frozen or pre-packed food but this specific one is a definite exception. The taste is subtle and not too spicy. When you are in the mood to have a light meal, this packet is perfect and you have the hot food in 2 minutes.Definitely worth the price.
A1CTVR2MDJHTT5	0	0	Book arrived on time and in execellent condition. Unfortunately, this is not my kind of book, so I wll not write a biased review.
A1CTVR2MDJHTT5	1	1	Book arrived on time and in excellent condition. The narrator details her experiences as a transported non-Jewish child placed in the protective custody during WWII. Far from being a story of Nazi atrocities, the book concentrates on the relationships formed between a loving "adopted" family and meaningful friendships with the hidden bonus of unlikely, but devoted friends and their mischievious youthful adventures. After the first few pages, the story grips your heart with details about a survivor in hidden by apolitcal French and ethical people putting themselves in danger to save an innocent child. A great book for book clubs of all interets.
A1CUGODMVM13NJ	1	1	I cannot express my love for this book enough. As soon as I downloaded it, I sat down and did not get back up until I'd read the book and pondered it for several minutes. It's easy to see how some modern movies and video games, such as Starship Troopers and the Halo video game series were influenced by this book. It's got a steady pace, which slows down just a bit at the end, but quickly regains its steam. There aren't any parts of this story that strayed from the overall tone and plot, and you get enveloped into Mandella's world very early in the book. HIGHLY recommended!
A1CUGODMVM13NJ	1	1	These books were required reading in my 7th grade Reading class, and I remember them quite fondly. I was hooked from the first novel, and traveled on the journey to the climatic end. These books are unlike anything you'll find anywhere else, I guarantee that. Nor will you easily forget them either. The characters are lovable, weird, distasteful, kind, and overall unique. The plot is unpredictable and different, which makes it a particularly refreshing read amongst the has-beens and copycat authors of today. Highly recommended for middle school and up, though to fully appreciate it you'll probably need to be a high school level reader. Very well-written and memorable.
A1CUHDEDD68Q1I	1	1	I have always had a weakness for Dada, and within this quixotic movement a special liking for Schwitters. So I visited the Dada-exposition in the Paris Centre Pompidou last year, and there bought both the Dickerman catalogue of the American exposition, and the (French language) catalogue of the Centre Pompidou itself, which differ in many ways. The exposition was wonderful by the way, and one of the best I' ve seen in many years. Thinking that a morning would be enough to see what I wanted to see, I changed my mind, decided to take dinner in the Pompidou, and stayed for the rest of the day. The immense amount of material was stunning. And the same thing really goes for both impressive catalogues. The American (Dickerman) version (520 pages) follows Dada by way of the cities where Dada developed, and does so in a more or less chronological fashion. Essays are excellent, photomaterial looks great. It is the sort of catalogue you would expect from an exposition like this. The European catalogue, more than thousand pages, printed on very thin paper, treats subjects, artists, and everything else connected with Dada according to alfabet. It seems to me that the catalogue has just about everything that could be seen at the exposition, with exception of the films of course. Although I felt a bit silly after buying both catalogues (spending some 100 euros), I was in the end very glad that I did. Everybody who buys catalogues now and then, know how disappointing these sometimes are. Well, these aren't. They are both superb, knowledgeable. And the people who made them have done a terrific job. In the end you wind up thinking: Hey, these guys (and girls) must have loved Dada as much as I do.
A1CUHDEDD68Q1I	1	1	Simenon's pipe smoking detective Maigret is so well known, that writing about him might be considered a waste of time. But then, I have to make amends. When I was young - sixties, 20th century - it was very fashionable to read Simenon. And although everybody around me did, including my own brother and father, I didn't, and I have no idea why. I wasn't much of a detective-fan in those years perhaps. And I didn't care about being &agrave; la mode. Anyway, I read an enormous amount of literature, but never Simenon. I was perhaps also a bit of a snob. And I was wrong.A few years ago I bought a few Maigrets, just for fun, and liked them. Some weeks later to my surprise there appeared in the (French-language) edition called Pleiade - which is the French equivalent of the American Library, but much more expensive, and a sort of ultimate crowning for every writer in it - two volumes with 20 novels by Simenon, half Maigret, and half non-Maigret. Because, apart from his 75 detectives and 28 short stories, he also wrote 117, what Simenon himself called "romans-durs": hard novels. I bought both volumes. The fact that Simenon, who in essence is a detective-writer, was taken up by the Pleiade really means something. In the thirties, when Simenon had just started writing, he was published by Gallimard, under the imprint NRF, and that is still the best you can do as a French writer. To which should be added that Simenon is from French-speaking Belgium. He was very proud of his publisher and of the writer-friends he got to know by publishing there. In the end I have also bought and read the ten volumes which are called in French "The Complete Maigret": Tout Maigret, and which contain all of his Maigrets in chronological order, including, in volume 10, the 28 short stories. I am pleased to see that Simenon is becoming fashionable again, as he should be.I think "Maigret and the Saturday caller" (Le client du samedi) is one of the very best. The novel demonstrates why it is not correct to call Simenon's Maigrets murder-stories, because murder is not what they are really about. The Saturday caller, (written in 1962) is largely situated in Montmartre. It is a very simple, but also very efficient, and at the same time a very credible and sad story, with a plot that is breathtakingly natural. When Maigret arrives home after work on a Saturday, at Boulevard Richard Lenoir, there is a man waiting for him, one Planchon. Maigret vaguely remembers his face. Planchon has been at his office quite a few times before, always on Saturdays, but without succeeding to meet the inspector because of his busy schedule. Planchon is nervous, and smells of alcohol. He explains that he will commit murder. He says: "I am not mad, inspector. I beg you to believe that I am not mad." Simenon then writes: "Generally this sort of thing was a bad sign, but Maigret was already half convinced." Convinced that the man is not mad, that is. Yet, Maigret is irritated. What can he do? He is the law. He cannot arrest someone for planning to commit murder. And then the story unfolds. The victim to be is Planchons wife, by the way. In the end Planchon won't commit murder, but somebody else will. What I especially like about the book is its economy, and the way in which the plot you expect, is turned around, and in a very natural way.Simenon is very good at creating atmosphere, but he is not a great writer in the literary sense of the word. The beginnings of his novels can be fascinating, but his plots tend to disappoint. Some of his books are real potboilers, especially the ones from his later years, after 1965. His style now and then is clich&eacute; ridden. He was not always a very pleasant man and it sometimes shows in his novels: he is a homophobe, and a bit of an anti-Semite. During the Second World War he didn't mind rubbing shoulders with the Germans, the way many French intellectuals did. Immediately after the war he left for Canada and the United States, only returning to Europe in 1955. And yet, a writer should be judged by his work, and he has in the end written an inordinate amount of good books. And this is definitely one of them.But there are many more. Read of his romans durs "The man who watched trains go by" and "The engagement". Read: "Maigret sets a trap" (Maigret tend un pi&egrave;ge), "Maigret in court" (Maigret aux assises), "Maigret in society" (Maigret et les vieillards), "Maigret and the lazy burglar" (Maigret et le voleur paresseux), "Maigret and the black sheep" (Maigret et les braves gens), "Maigret on the defensive" (Maigret se defend), and as far as I am concerned, his last good Maigret, from 1965: "The patience of Maigret" (Maigrets patience). And that is just a selection. Some of his short stories are great too. Henry James wrote: The house of literature has many doors. Or words to that effect. So it is.

A1CV3P3463ARD6	1	0	Fascinating twists & turns and you feel as tough you are part of the story...Continuous conflicts between warlords and non-stop invasions from the vikings made life very insecure in those days... if you're lucky, you win and plunder your enemy and keep his women & children as your slaves but if you have a bad day, you're killed savagely and only God knows what happens to your family...And they didn't have radar technology in those days, so an attack could be sprung on anybody at any time... and women & children sold in slavery and/or prostitution and never knowing where the next meal will come from...What a life and described so realistically... 5 stars...I bet some of them wished the Romans would come back and keep the peace???
A1CV3P3463ARD6	1	0	I keep referring to it as Dr Hamer's book but he didn't write it...it's about his work but it was written by a French guy named Patrick Obissier and the book is titled "Biogenealogy - decoding psychic roots of illness" I don't think the title even comes close to doing justice to the contents of the book... it will be one of the few PERMANENT books in my library... I read it 3 times and I will read it again... until I master the material and I can comfortably teach it... I see it as an expansion on the concept of shock & trauma... his concept of trauma reaches far back into our lineage and includes various illnesses as a way of resolving it... for me, he completely turned the concept of illness upside down to the point that I now welcome it because it is the final repair phase where things come back to normal...FASCINATING...
A1CV3P3463ARD6	1	0	I've been trying many different products to control my chronic stress and related high Cortisol levels. I'm not interested in loosing belly fat/inches because I don't have any. I've been disappointed by all the products I've tried because they all contain stimulants [caffeine, guarana, epeherine or their derivatives...] and that drives me up the wall and prevents me from sleeping. I tried Relacore because it contains vitamins that are directly related to stress management [vitB] by acting on the adrenal glands. Also the formula contains herbs that calm the nervous system. I just finished my first bottle and I noticed in the last month that I was calmer, I slept much better, my appetite and digestion are working very well, my energy is much improved [without any over-stimulation] and a lot of anxiety and tension has left my body... I couldn't ask for more... Thank you!
A1CV3P3463ARD6	1	1	I've had one of these in my bedroom for over 10 years to contain dust & smog in California and dust & vog in Hawaii... the unit is efficient and very quiet and takes up little space.

A1CV3P3463ARD6	0	0	what can you expect from an MD except a rehashing of the praises of conventional therapies and total ignorance & negativity about alternative therapies of which he has no knowledge or expertise in...he talks of healing cancer with the different modern conventional therapies... but surgery, radiation and chemo are not much more than amputation, blasting [WMDs] and poisoning of the patient... this is gambling at best with the [quality of] life of the patient...The inquisitors of the catholic church in the middle ages did the same thing when torturing their guests...most of these therapies originate from military technologies and are downsized to treat cancer... what a concept... nothing more than a scam to create a civilian commercial outlet for military technology... most of it paid for by your taxes...and remember that several states have enacted laws that prohibit treating [or claiming to] cancer any other way than with conventional therapies... what a way to protect your interests and business model... just create a legalized monopoly and keep everybody else out...there will never be a cure for cancer... to many [medical, insurance, politicians, researchers, corporations] people depend on it for a very good living...so this book amounts to nothing more than towing the conventional line, reciting the same old BS and perpetuating the fear mongering...if you're looking for real healing solutions, look elsewhere...
A1CV3P3463ARD6	1	1	this toothbrush does a great job on/between your teeth & gums and it's as light and easy to use as a regular toothbrush... the original battery lasted a couple of months of brushing twice daily and I was able to replace the AAA battery last night... I highly recommend this product.
A1CV4KUVXP53KH	1	1	this movie is probably one of my favorites. Screenwriter Stephen Phillips (albert brooks) falls out of favor in the production studio. He hits a wall in his career. His friend (jeff bridges) refers him to the muse (sharon stone) who will inspire him to write the best script he ever wrote. Sarah, the muse, demands many things from Stephen and she is very picky and irritating. His wife Laura(Andie macdowell) becomes very suspicious but then also becomes inspired by the muse. there is also a twist at the end that will make you think! this movie is very smart and very funny. The picture of the DVD isnt as clear as you would expect but it is only a minor flaw. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good comedy. two thumbs up!!!
A1CV4KUVXP53KH	0	1	I really liked the Exorcist. In fact it's probably my favorite movie ever! But it's the kind of movie that doesn't need a sequel! That's probably why a lot of people don't like this movie. But I have a different reason for not liking it: IT WAS CORNY. I mean come on people. Did the people who made this movie think that it was good? Here's how the movie goes: Reagan is still traumatized by her exorcism so she sees a psychologist named Jean. Sweaty Father Lamont shows up to find information about Father Merrin (from the first film) but ends up staying to help Reagan fight the eee-ville (which is how he pronounces it) that's still inside of her. The rest of the movie is so corny you won't believe. They use a flashing light thing to hypnotize each other. Father Lamont takes a trip to Africa to find out about Father Merrin's previous exorcism. It takes away the scariness from the first movie. I thought she was possesed by the devil, you know, Satan. but it turns out she was possesed by an african demon Pezuzu. Pezuzu takes the form of a swarm of locusts (is that really scary?). Reagan is supposed to be 'the good locust' and that's why Pezuzu wants her. they go back to the house from the first movie and try to get rid of Pezuzu once and for all. The "special effects" really suck (well... what did you expect?) and some of the dialouge doesn't make sense. "If pezuzu comes for you, i will spit a leopard" What does that mean?? But I gave it 2 stars because Linda Blair looks good and I like the whole Exorcist thing. It wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, but what can you do... it's a corny movie from the 70s. This movie does contain my favorite corny moment: James Earl Jones hawking out a cherry tomatoe onto a bed of spikes ! (it's funny to watch that part backwards) Check it out if you're really into the Exorcist or Linda Blair. ...
A1CV4KUVXP53KH	1	1	Did you like the 'Sixth Sense'? Did 'What Lies Beneath' make you jump?! Well this movie is better than both of those. The Others has this atmosphere of tension and creepiness. It keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Nicole Kidman plays an english housewife named Grace who is raising two diseased children while their father is at war. The children have an allergy to light so everything is very dark and candlelit. The children say they see other people in the house... but Grace and the servants find nothing. There is a twist at the end that's very good and suprising! The cinematography is excellent, the acting is outstanding, the plot is believable and very good also. This whole movie is first-class! It's going to remain one of my favorite movies of all time! I recommend this to everyone and especially those who like tense horror movies! Two thumbs WAY up!!!
A1CV4KUVXP53KH	1	1	After seeing both Ringu and The Ring, I had to read the novel that inspired it all. It's the same basic story from the movies: people watch a strange video and die exactley seven days later. The beginning of the book should be familiar to those who have seen the movies. However, as the story continues, it proves to be very different from either film. It's intricate, creepy, mysterious, captivating and often quite disturbing. The translation is very smooth despite what you may have heard and it was an easy read. It's such a great modern horror tale that's written so well, you'd think it could actually happen. If you've seen the film, read the book to see where it all started. Can't wait for the next book in the trilogy: SPIRAL
A1CV6LWZMDWR3Z	0	0	I got this video in an attempt to learn some new things and some new views on things. Bad plan. For me, anyway. This video didn't present anything at all new. Talks about women needing to feel loved, wanted, nurtured, etc. I was hoping for more elaboration on specific practices, techniques, etc. This video is more of a porn flick with a doctor legitimizing the "documentary intent" between scenes.I didn't give this a 1-star rating because it can give some ideas, and maybe a starting point for coming up with your own. It also might not be too bad for those men that have had no prior training or counseling, and straight up have no clue.
A1CV6LWZMDWR3Z	1	1	It's unfortunate that people MUST buy THIS one for the 360, however it is worth it in the end to get rid of wires and such. If you can spare the extra money, I highly recommend it!
A1CV6LWZMDWR3Z	1	1	This book is certainly not a comprehensive item, but for those relatively new to Asian thought, it's a great start. As a matter-of-fact, it acknowledges this expected shortfall by providing suggested reading to expand on ideas presented in the book. It very directly presents and addresses key points and concepts within each of the major systems. I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants a little insight and a basic starting point towards understanding our Asian counterparts.
A1CV6LWZMDWR3Z	1	1	I bought it for my niece and my sister tells me it's great and my niece loves to play with it in the tub!
A1CV6UVFU998DI	0	0	I bought this CD after I heard a few of their songs on an internet radio broadcast. My computer speakers aren't the greatest, so I somehow missed the electronic drums that are used. Boy did that throw me for a loop when I slapped this CD on. WTF?!?! Electronic drums in Black/Viking metal?!?! Completely ruins this album. I really tried to like it too, 'cause it'd be a darn good CD (hence the 2 stars instead of completely demoting it to 1) if not for the stupid electronic drums. I just couldn't get past the fake tic-tic-tic sound. I don't know if the rest of their stuff is like that, but jesus guys, this doesn't work out, get a real drumset.
A1CV6UVFU998DI	1	1	"Welcome to the Orgy of the Dead,Through the Isle of Doom and the Village of the Damned"This is one of my favorite albums. These guys ARE Gothabilly. Like the Meteors, but all gothed out. Oooh... spooky. Reverend Doom's got a seriously cool voice, Ghastly lays down some wicked rockabilly guitar licks, Lord Erik's base is thick and krunchy and Markus Dark ties it all together like the The Dude's rug, man. Definitely influenced by the Meteors (duh), the Cramps (yup), Demented are Go, not to mention old-school rockabilly and scores of B-rate horror movies.Great stuff. Get it? Got it. Good.
A1CV6UVFU998DI	0	0	Angels could be a cool album, but it's just not. I was looking forward to hearing the old Amorphis singer again, in a new forum. He's still awesome, but the rest of the band is just bad. The riffs are unimaginative and the drumming is simple and entirely too bare bones. Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album. Quietus is intense, atmospheric and amazingly complex doom metal. Go buy Evoken's album instead.
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	0	0	sucks. save your money. (now i am just satisfying the word minimum...la de da...doo be doo be dooo. oh man!!! so twenty words, or more? YIKES.)
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	1	it is a beautiful film, skillfully executed. Christopher Thornton is a revelation! Lewis is purely authentic, as usual; Bloom carries off one of the most intense characters, in the most beautifully perfect way, ever.
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	0	simply put, this is a different film, from the theatrical release, and had the butchers allowed Sir Scott to release the film in tact, they would all have been swimming in golden statues. i won't write that the original is not great--it is, but any questions raised, and left unanswered, the first time 'round are all very neatly, and beautifully answered, by the director's cut.there is nothing i can think of, that would have possibly made this a better film. beautifully executed, with great skill, and craftsmanship.
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	1	this film is excellent. well crafted, and skillfully executed. beautiful people, and a beautiful setting, but entirely fluff-free; an absolute heart-breaker. (p.s. i HATE chick-flicks. this is no chick-flick.)
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	0	it is my understanding that the effort expended, in the pursuit of this project was phenomenal. seeing even the first few minutes, one can understand why they were all willing to face the Wrath of Gods, in order to complete it.
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	1	for everyone who thinks this is a place to complain about amazon prime--suck it.for anyone who actually loves this series, this is a truly cool story; i don't want to SPOIL anything, but it is not often that anyone gets one over on the doctor.
A1CVEWQPW4KFJG	1	1	at this time i would like to say that i am crushing like crazy on Captain Jack Harkness. i have NOT yet seen Miracle Day (it is due out on dvd tomorrow--FINGERS CROSSED!!!), but i am truly sad that the TINY MINDS of the world might let Torchwood die, without closure. i PRAY (c'mon, pray with me.) that the 50th Anniversary Doctor Who season will include Jack--it really should.John Barrowman plays Jack, and is a really lovely person--i hope nothing but happiness, for him, and everyone he loves.
A1CVJNL3Z0J3RP	1	1	The ink is barely dry on her employer's contract with Drip Not Paint when temporary worker Kyle Shannon finds herself having coffee with a corpse. And you thought starting a new job was tough! Hired to sort out problems with customer service, Kyle soon discovers irregularities in the family-owned business aren't limited to the inventory. She investigates, only to learn that, chillingly, the murderered man had been following the same trail and now his killer is stalking her.This is Mickey's(Greased Wheels)second novel and she knows her territory. Filled with authentic police procedure and fascinating glimpses into corporate life where sexual intimidation,internal politics and greed become a deadly mix, Defective Goods is the ultimate "outsider-on-the-inside" novel.
A1CVJNL3Z0J3RP	1	1	This is one hell of a read. From the title, I was expecting a yawner romance, a ripped bodice, maybe an understated murder or two. By the time I finished the opening scene,however,I knew I had badly underestimated what is actually a chase/thriller with pacing and wild action that makes The DaVinci Code seem like a day at Grandma's house. The plotting is deft as Brod weaves the excitement and honor of Arthurian legend into modern times. Drawn to the characters, grabbed by the premise, I was hooked. Brod has pulled the sword from the stone with this one.
A1CVJNL3Z0J3RP	1	1	Nigerian swindlers promise us untold millions, all the while trying to stick their greasy cyber fingers into our bank accounts. Armed with his wits and a Hotmail address, and with an outrageous cast of American icons to back him up (even Mr. Potter of the Bedford Falls Savings and Loan takes a turn), Siegel fights back. Larry King should read this book. Oprah should FEATURE this book! Bottom line, Rich Siegel deserves a medal as the John Wayne of counter-spammers. I was hoarse with laughter after the first few pages, shared the first section with a friend by phone, and finished the entire thing in a ninety minutes. If you're sick of spam, there's no question you'll enjoy this as much as I did.
A1CVW4C02Z6YS1	1	1	Very good CD. I burnt most ost the songs I prefer. I think this was best for me as it seemed to have the main songs I prefer.
A1CVW4C02Z6YS1	1	1	This is a very talented group. This Images and Words album is really the only one I like with them.James LaBrie - Lead Vocals, tambourineJohn Petrucci - Lead Guitar, Rhythm GuitarJohn Myung - Bass GuitarMike Portnoy - DrumsKevin Moore - KeyboardAfter Kevin Moore left I didn't care for next one's style. It's just not the same. Bass Guitarist doesn't always stand out and to get credit but this bass guitarist really play many notes, he jams probabaly more then any I heard I'm thinkin.
A1CVW4C02Z6YS1	0	1	I bought these once for older car and it took longer crank over time to start and not as much power as the orignal platnum plugs Mercury Mystique 4 banger I had. I did try to find the one with just the one ground one straight shooting spark because I thought the gave this older 1977 chevy nova 6 cylnder more power. I think with four floating grounds, sparks are weak, but I'm no mechanic, just a weekend warrior.
A1CWP65SVRXQ2N	1	1	If you can get over (1) that a middle-aged out of shape guy is beating up everyone and (2) the show is a lot like Lost and risks leading nowhere, it's a great first season. Lots of action and a good-enough storyline to make you want season 2.
A1CWP65SVRXQ2N	1	1	I have nothing negative to say about this movie. A must see if you like action. You don't need to be a big comic book guy or have seen any of the other movies with these superheros (Although I'd recommend the Iron Man movies) to enjoy this movie.
A1CWP65SVRXQ2N	1	1	unless you're really freaked out by zombies (which I am), just watch this show. Two days after buying season 1, you'll buy season 2.*I don't understand, however, why they can steal and wreck really nice cars, but they drive around full-time in cars that keep breaking down and they can't find parts.
A1CWP65SVRXQ2N	0	1	i'm spoiled watching good History Channel footage. If you want raw footage with little cohesiveness to glue the footage together for you then this is for you.
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	After you finish this book, you will wish you had read it a couple years earlier so you could have had a chance to meet this great American. I have known for a long time that Sheldon was a great author but had no idea that he had lived the ultimate American Dream before he started writing so late in life. The book inspired me to read his fiction and he is now one of my favorite authors. In his fiction, you will see many of the characters from his life. This is a great rags to riches story!
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	This is one of the best books I have read lately. Somewhere between an expose, history lesson, and memoir, the book provokes many thoughts as to where his past and future meals come from and their effects on the world. Reading it made me contemplate buying a place in the country and raising my own food. Particularly pertinent at this time of increased ethanol production and consumption, that section is equally informative in explaining how we are awash in a big government subsidized tidal wave of corn.
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	A great book. Surprising that it is not more well-known. Author has a humorous way of showing the good and bad of both sides. Through this process of self-discovery, the author comes to the conclusion that he is in the middle of both sides. Such an enlightened viewpoint is a breath of fresh air from the many extremists who don't want to be confused with the facts. Highly recommended no matter your political persuasion.
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	Like all the other Bryon books I have read, this gem will make you howl with delight. It also has a more serious side than his other works I have enjoyed. In addition, don't be surprised if you finish inspired to take a long hike of your own...
A1CWR5CPF5J747	0	0	The walker is advertised for 4 months and up. Our little one is 5 months old, normal height and is still not close to reaching the floor. Maybe it should be call the hovercraft- because that's all baby can do on this. To add insult to injury, it was difficult to fold up when we realized we had to put it away for a couple more months. If your 4-5 month old baby is Wilt Chamberlain Jr., go for it, otherwise hold off. Boo!!!
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	This is a wonderful book detailing the life of Dois Rosser and what God has done through his life. Dois is a brilliant businessman who has used His God given talents to literally change nations. To date, his organization has helped build nearly 4000 Christ centered churches around the world.I also recommend reading Dick Woodward's "Four Spiritual Secrets" immediately before or after this book. Dick and his "Mini Bible College" are the inspiration for ICM. Whether you are into good writing (with the assistance of Ellen Vaughn), inspiration on how you can use Mr. Rosser's insights in your own life to help others or successful church building ideas, this book is a well worth it!
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	Awesome documentary in the line of Super-Size Me. I just bought a juicer after watching it. Hopefully such films will enlighten our population about the harmful effects of most of the foods in our restaurants and groceries!
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	"Into the Wild" is an awesome book. If you like, I would also recommend the newly published book and DVD titled "Back to the Wild". They show many more photos that Chris took on his journey and explain more about his life and adventures. They are also available on Amazon.
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	This is a great book to read at bed time. Instills good calues and it has stood the test of time. I highly recommend it!
A1CWR5CPF5J747	1	1	Great movie. I wish there were more family and Christian movies like this. Very inspirational and highly recommended for all dads out there!
A1CX3XD8UF5VUS	1	1	My daughter got this for her third birthday and she loves it! We have a birthday party nearly everyday, followed up with ice cream (another fabulous Melissa and Doug set). I love the storage boxes that these toys come with. She doesn't have trouble cutting it or anything and loves to decorate it with the candy. Great, great idea!
A1CX3XD8UF5VUS	0	0	I am by no means giving the story a poor review. I love the book and so do my kids. I highly recommend it. But, get the Board Book version instead. This particular hardcover book is so small it would be terrible to read to a child. I returned it and plan to use my refund to get the board book version.
A1CX3XD8UF5VUS	1	1	My almost 4-year-old daughter loves this show. I was so happy to see it here and for this great price! It is a cute show, but a guaranteed hit for a horse-loving kid.
A1CX3XD8UF5VUS	1	1	I'm so shocked that these have negative reviews that I had to give a good review. These are the best mousetraps out there! I have to catch 1-4 mice per year in my kitchen, and I've found that the traditional mousetraps are not sensitive enough. I'll have 2 or 3 traps licked clean before I get a catch or even a trip. I love these with the fake cheese because you can set it on the sensitive side and just barely catch the trigger so that it won't let a mouse on it without snapping - ever! Everyone else must be using it wrong. I'm here looking for them because I can't find these in a local store anymore and I need more! Play with - you do have to find the right balance of sensitive enough to trigger on the mouse, but not snapping while you are setting it down. But, it beats 4 rounds of resetting it because your smart mouse figured out how to lick it clean without snapping it! FYI, I always smear a little peanut butter on it even though these say they don't need bait, I have never tried it without bait.
A1CX8R8NRKCW7P	0	1	While it is capable of producing an exciting "sound," Williams' music lacks the depth and originality found in truly timeless work. His fanfares provide the listener with a certain Pro tem, but as time passes so has Williams'. He gave us something inventive in the 70s, when he was at his creative peak. Today, is it difficult to discern which is more indifferent, the music or the listener? What about the many fans of Williams, myself included? He is my reason for studying music. Nevertheless, like the composer, we should stop screaming from center stage. Fellow music lovers, if you keep buying albums, they will keep hiring the same composer. Allow a newer composer, an unheard "voice," to speak.
A1CX8R8NRKCW7P	0	0	This film had good intentions, really it did. It's not like those typical horror films of present day, which tend to rely on hyper-gore or sadism to make you cringe. This one clearly wants to spook you, old-fashioned style, and it makes a real attempt to develop its characters, its atmosphere and the suspense before the big payoff. Unfortunately, it does all these things so poorly that it fails on every level, at least for this reviewer. The characters here are so poorly written, I don't know where to start. This movie is about 95% attempting-to-be-witty-dialogue, so how is it possible that after all that talking, I still don't understand what makes them tick? These aren't believable people, they are caricatures of themselves and we never really get to know them on a human level. The pacing of the story (or lack thereof) and editing between shots is tedious and aimless; I started to feel like I was working the 3am shift at this hotel. And as for the last act? A completely underwhelming payoff that relies on genre cliches, and anyways it comes as too little too late. I'd lost interest by then... in the characters, in the ghosts, in why any of this was happening. The fact that nothing is explained after all is said and done is fitting... I'm not even sure the director knows.This feels like a student film. Which would be fine, if it were a school project. This movie feels like an afterthought, as some semblance of a feeling that the writer/director had but never really took the time to flesh out. The fact that this is $10 to rent should make your choice easy... skip this one.
A1CXY4X4KRHN69	1	1	My whole family loves this game since it has levels from the down right simple for the younger crowd to the tough to conquer for the advanced skills of the most practiced gamers. Love the rabbits and all the funny stuff included in the game. Even the people in the room watching us play got a big kick out of it. You can always go back to previous levels that you really enjoyed without losing your top skill level or creating a new profile. Great fun and great laughs.
A1CXY4X4KRHN69	1	1	I love this phone case. Its easy to remove my iphone using one hand. The first horizontal phone case I purchased for my iphone did not have deep enough cut outs making it impossible to hear my phone ring, plug in the headphones, and push my phone out one-handed using the bottom finger hole. This one is perfect. I prefer the horizontal style of holder since it doesn't get in the way when sitting. The clip is strong enough to clip onto my pocket, belt, or purse strap without sliding around. There is a pocket inside the holster that makes a great place to store credit card, drivers license, or the cleaning cloth that came with my iPhone. The velcro style closure is my preference although it can be noisy in a quiet room. I've been told that the magnetic closures are not safe to use with the iPhones, not sure what effect they have but since the iPhones are not exactly cheap, I don't want to take the chance of messing up mine. Besides quiet is not the norm in my world with 2 young kids. I will say that I am concerned about scratches to my phone once it is removed from the holster but I feel perfectly safe otherwise. Really like the fact that people can't see what type of phone I have until I remove it from the case and hopefully reducing the chances that my pretty little penny may be stolen.
A1CXY4X4KRHN69	1	1	I can't get enough of this show! I am not fond of sitting down to watch TV, but this show has me hooked. I started watching it on Netflix & once I exhausted all the episodes on Netflix, there was a small amount of panic building up that the show may not have a 4th season. So happy that I found the 4th season on Amazon!!
A1CY3T4E1XJ1MX	0	0	This product made my prescription lenses WORSE. Have tried everything to get it off. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO GET THIS STUFF OFF?? PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO AND REPLY TO THIS THREAD.
A1CY56EMMGYP15	1	1	The story of an adopted girl seeking her real mother is only the beginning. Stanley Gordon West explores what it means to be adopted, and what families are about, in such vivid, tender, emotionally rich prose that this book simply glows.
A1CY56EMMGYP15	1	1	Doris Meredith's understanding of human nature, and her grasp of the difficulties of detection and prosecution of crime, add up to a splendid mystery which absorbed me and kept me guessing. She has assembled some marvelous characters, all bookish by nature, who end up doing some amateur sleuthing that shames the cops. This is a tender story, filled with empathy toward people in trouble. I cherish these books, and believe mystery readers will love them too.
A1CY56EMMGYP15	1	1	I titled this book The Worth of a Man, which goes to the heart of my story, but the publishers changed it. It is a study of the power and beauty of conscience, and how two people transformed their lives by doing what they had to do to make themselves whole.The hero, Truman Jackson, is a former bank robber who, with his wife Gracie, has lived an exemplary life for many years. And yet, they both know that their secret past keeps them from the happiness and peace they yearn for. So they decide to make their past known to the small frontier community which has embraced them, and begin the process of repaying everyone they can find who had suffered loss because of the robberies. The results are shocking. Far from welcoming the reformed pair, most of the citizens shun and condemn them, and suddenly Truman and Gracie's lives are torn apart.The book explores goodness and evil, forgiveness and hardness of heart. It is also about how the vision and courage of one sterling man and one sterling woman can transform the world.
A1CY56EMMGYP15	0	1	I leave it to others to rate this novel, but I believe that this, my 45th novel, is the finest short fiction I have written. It is about a courageous editor, Angie Drum, who discovers that her own son, the mayor of a Kansas cowtown, is corrupt. She chooses to expose him and his cronies, at great anguish to herself. Her moral courage and determination lie at the heart of the story.The cover depicts three armed gunmen, but do not be misled. There are no gunfights in this story. The Hollywood West does not exist in this novel. It is simply a story of a woman of great spiritual beauty wrestling with her conscience, and in the end, doing what is right, at terrible cost.I am grateful to Amazon for letting me provide an accurate description of the novel for the benefit of readers and customers.
A1CY5ISF2ZWO45	1	1	I have never had one problem with this monitor. It works great. Occasionally (once a month) you'll hear a cb radio come over the frequency for a second, but it doesn't wake the baby or anything and it's gone as quickly as it came. I highly recommend this monitor.
A1CY5ISF2ZWO45	1	1	These bottles are great if you have a colicky baby. People complain about the extra pieces being a pain to wash. If you put them in the dishwasher, it's not that big of a deal. Even washing them by hand is not difficult. These bottles get rid of the air bubbles almost entirely which helps when your child has reflux or is really gassy. My child had reflux and we had to put rice cereal in these bottles as well...if you have to do that, then you need the Y-cut nipples as well. Great bottles.
A1CY5ISF2ZWO45	1	1	My mom bought this table and I bought a Fisher Price table. The kids love the Leap Frog Table and hate the Fisher Price one. The Leap Frog one is awesome! It has two options, words or music. So for the little ones to whom words don't mean much, you can use the music reinforcement and my toddler (age 2) likes the word option now. Great for around age 8 months when they start pulling up to stand. Love Love Love this table.
A1CY5ISF2ZWO45	1	1	Everyone says that all car seats are the same...I think this one is worth the extra money. My second child is in this one and my first is in his original Cosco one. The Cosco is adequate but the Britax is 1. easier to install, 2. easier to put straps on, and 3. probably the most irritating thing about the Cosco is trying to adjust the straps and tighten them and Britax is a piece of cake. I have had so many less frustrations with the Britax and it even has little velcro spots to put the straps on when you are not using them so that when you put your child in, you are not mussing about trying to find the straps from underneath them. Great car seat!
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	0	1	A little pricey for a carrier with little to no versatility. We used it perhaps 15-20 times in her first year. By the time she reached ~15 pounds, the pull on our shoulders was dreadful.I vastly prefer my MUCH less expensive slings and wraps for ease of use, comfort for both mother and baby, versatility and variety of carries, and proper ergonomic support for the baby's spine. For the price, get a wrap /and/ a sling instead, and still save a few bucks, and use them well into the third year!
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	1	1	When attempting a book review, reading comprehension is very important. Without picking on individual reviewers, several of the bad reviews pick things out of the book to complain about, obviously without having read it very carefully. That's a shame.Yes, the nut issue should probably be revisited. However, this is still a subject of debate amongst doctors and scientists, and this book hasn't been revised since 1998. Her recommendations are still quite cautious, if you read them all and read them carefully. Use your common sense.The author does not recommend home prepared carrots for newborns. A section clearly states they (and other nitrate containing vegetables) be withheld until a certain age. This is in line with current recommendations.Yes, the book could be condensed and better structured, and that would probably help the impatient people who don't want to read the whole thing carefully. With any book, you do have to do your own fact checking to be sure it meets (constantly changing) current recommendations. I would also like the author to revise and include more information about breastmilk and how extended breastfeeding fits into the toddler diet. I would also like to see typos fixed. More citations would be great.Yet, this book is still a powerhouse of useful information. I've never seen infant nutrition so thoroughly and practically addressed. The recipes are creative and useful. The book also helps you learn to pump up the nutrition in standard recipes, and gives you practical methods for making and freezing baby food and other foods. Health and santitation information is also extremely useful. This is a must-have in my kitchen.
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	1	1	This really should be required reading for every expectant parent. It provides a nice, reassuring counterpoint to hysterical fear mongering books like, "What to Expect (to go horribly wrong) When You're Expecting."
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	1	1	I use this cookbook quite a bit. Lately, my schedule has been such that I'm almost never home in the typical "dinner prep" time frame, but still have a family to feed. I've been using my Crock, and this book, nearly 4 times a week.I love the huge variety of detail. There are extremely long cooking recipes, and quick cooking recipes. Some days, I forget to throw something in in the morning, and I can still find plenty of recipes that I can throw together in the early afternoon and will still be ready by dinnertime. I've found that it's not only important to pay attention to the cooking times, but also, to pay attention to the recommended slow cooker size for each recipe. Things recommended for small cookers, cooked in larger cookers, may scorch. Things recommended for large cookers, squished into a smaller cooker, may not finish cooking or come up to temperature. Those details are important.I've had a few recipes that I followed to the letter turn out strangely: the Hamburger Soup was way too thick, the Potato Soup way too thin. However, there's plenty of information in these pages about how to modify things, so I find I can usually adjust the consistency to my taste without adding a lot of extra cooking time, and if worst comes to worst, I know how to fix it next time.I love this cookbook. I can cook when I feel like cooking, and we can still eat when we usually would. Brilliant.
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	0	0	I'm here to write my third horrible review of a Rival Crockpot. I've had this for several years, but used it only for special occasions, due to its size. So it's safe to say it was not used heavily or abused.The handle of the lid snapped off the last time I was cooking in it, while the lid was steaming hot. I wasn't surprised, because just a few months ago, this happened to my smaller, newer model as well. My first Crockpot had to be thrown away for throwing sparks and shorting out for no apparent reason.I will not buy a Rival Crockpot again.
A1CYHSRHBDF1S1	0	0	I've had this Crockpot about two or three years. I've used it about 6-8 times per year. And the plastic handle on the lid cracked in two and fell off.I was about to accept this as a weird fluke, until the plastic handle on the lid of my larger Crockpot did the exact same thing a few months later. I'd had it longer, but used it less. WTF?I can't find replacement lids for both models on their site. They have no online support. So what am I to do with two Crockpots with lids that are useless? My last Crockpot, previous to these two, threw sparks and shorted out a mere year after purchase. I'm done with Rival.
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	1	I bought this bag at a Saks off Fifth because it was on sale. I hesitated but only because of the color. 'Coconut'. I'm pretty hard on my bags and I'd worry I'd ink up anything white right off.But I haven't yet and the bag is gorgeous. Pure luxury. Baby soft leather of the highest quality. I get an enormous amount of compliments. So much nicer than say Louis Vuitton bags and you don't have to worry about people walking up to you and asking if it's authentic. I also have a Mulberry Roxanne, and while I prefer the colour of it (a lovely warm mulberry colour) I prefer the style of this bag. Classic. Will never go out of style.
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	1	I can't say enough good things about this album. Up front, I'm a huge Jack White fan and his hand in it alone made me want to buy it. I grew up on Loretta and like most mountain girls "Coal Miners Daughter" was a song I began singing in the shower when I was five. So I was eager to see what the partnership produced.I waited on this for a year (after hearing it was in the works). Lynn is as magical as always and that she chose to go in such a different direction, especially at her age (my grandfather is sorely disappointed) and at this point in her career was a brave move. But it worked. I don't do album reviews, and I'm no music guru. But I like what I like. White Stripes fans will love the album. So will country music fans who can appreciate the new twist.
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	1	I'm not a big perfume girl. I mean, I love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones. But I generally prefer essential oils over perfume. That said, out of the dozens that I own, I keep three on hand at all times. (Four if you count the little mini I got from SpaceNK)Santa Maria Novella for rubbing on my ankles. I know it's a bit mature but it reminds me of Italy. And monks.Chanel Mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love Chanel and I just prefer that scent to the others.And Marc Jacobs because, to be honest, if I had to choose the loveliest, this would be it. It's lovely and light. Not too over powering. Affordable. And gets tons of compliments.Also comes in cute bottle. :)
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	0	Best weekly glossy on the shelves. I buy it every week to peruse over smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. The articles are deliciously light and there are loads of fashion photos and pack shots. Yeah, I know. But let's be honest, if you're buying a glossy for enlightenment or any real understanding...you're doing something wrong.I'll stick with wonderful product pics.
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	1	I'm a huge fan of Flannery O'Connor so when someone asked me to name my favourite novel I picked a little bit-of-a-book and said "Wise Blood".Partly because the characters are, if not wholly understood, at least wholly familiar. Despite growing up around an assortment of Evangelicals and Foundation types I managed for the most part to maintain a pretty superficial view of them. Things like snake handling and female oppression were odd but ordinary and because of this ordinary I never spent too much time thinking about the misguided spirituality that a lot of it sat upon. Through a glass darkly, and all that.Mostly, I'm moved to recommend Wise Blood again and again because it's such a brilliantly layered and grotesque comedy with powerful and appealing themes of integrity, the disaffected young and redemption. It's just one of those books you never really walk away from. Not really.And that's a good thing.
A1CYQH3WEVZXUK	1	1	"No Country for Old Men" was cheerful by comparison. Never watch "P.S. I Love You" unless you plan on feeling like you've just bottomed out. If you're okay with that sort of feeling, if you like a good tear jerker, then you'll probably love it.I gave it four stars because it really was a good movie, but I wouldn't watch it again unless I was looking to come down from an insane happy-high.
A1CZ1EI4XZA1YE	1	1	The first feature worth mentioning in Clive Barker's newest child targeted exploit, ABARAT, is the wonderfully detailed color illustrations that fill the pages and really make the story come alive. However, at times the story seems to merely present a medium for the art to be displayed. The characters, at most times, are hardly three-dimensional, including the main-character Candy Quackenbush. Her name in itself is far more of a distraction than an asset to the entire plot. However, I do greatly admire Barker's way of displaying the antagonist in the story and will be reading the next addition to the series when it comes out to find out how his life continues.All in all, this book is hardly the masterpiece that The Thief of Always is and will probably always be but is worth acquiring for the pure artistic "oomph" that this book packs. It makes it well worth that price.
A1CZ1EI4XZA1YE	1	1	Mario Pei, I must admit, started my studies in linguistics that began in high school, followed me through college, and have shaped my career. The first book that I read of his was his solo work &quot;The Story of Language&quot;, a work of art in the linguistic field. While this guidebook for beginners in the field does not enjoy some of the wonderfully fluid prose that Pei uses in many of his works, it retains the same attention to detail. Despite many linguistic advances that have rendered some of the references obselete, this book come highly recommended and a must-have for students and teachers.Robert Goodhue Woodruff
A1CZ1FYWT9KZ3P	1	1	Set in east LA about a gay Latino man, Diego, and his coming out who has hidden furtive encounters with Pablo, a successful real estate broker who lives in denial and loves roleplaying. Anglo homo's are moving in and gentrifying the neighborhood to the concern of many folks. Bianca (formerly Blanca) breezes in from Europe and everything is in place for the free-for-all.It was interesting, and frustrating, to watch the back and forth nature of the plot: Two characters get together...break up...back together... There is some tension between one GWM (a twink from Mississippi) and a hilarious moment with an AA group meeting in his house. Even with the predictability of the plot several characters grew on me, notably the sister who I was ready to kill at the beginning and hug at the end.The movie could have used a better lighting engineer, there were many scenes that were difficult to see because low light was ill aimed. However, it wasn't a deal breaker.
A1CZ1FYWT9KZ3P	1	1	An Israeli movie about finding love in an era of conflict. While Noam and his roommates find a way to keep Ashraf in the country they are trying to navigate their own romantic challenges.There were scenes that really illustrated the tit-for-tat nature of the situation and the depth of anger on both sides. "Have you ever had the leg of an eight year old bombing victim fall on you?" One Israeli woman shouts as they organize a "Rave Against The Occupation" and the wake Ashraf's family sits for his sister killed by soldiers chasing terrorists. Or establishing shots of Nablus with rubble and broken down cars contrasting with the lively streets of Tel-Aviv.There were parts that were difficult for me to watch just because of the dramatic suspense. The ending is distinctly bittersweet.
A1CZ1FYWT9KZ3P	1	1	This album first made it's way into my collection in the vinyl format in the mid-80's. It's a witty and funny cabaret style performance. Ms. Gulch is a device for the show, she was actually played by Margaret Hamilton, a professional in the truest sense of the word. But in the hands of Mr. Barton she becomes a cynical but humorous character I love to spend time with.It was such a joy to find this available on CD and be able to return this to my playlist.
A1D0DP3QWJL8JZ	1	1	Came on time, sturdy, easy to use. It's a dustpan, what else can you say about it?I need to use it more?
A1D0DP3QWJL8JZ	1	1	Simply brilliant; the interviews are great and you learn new things about Bob that you never knew.Plus his music plays the entire time!
A1D0HXH03X2A5M	1	1	A great book! If you only half believe that Jesus wants to heal you, read this book. If your faith in divine healing is wavering, read this book. One of the best ever written on this subject.If you want to balance it with someone else's teaching, grab The Real Faith for Healing by Charles S Price and read that as well.
A1D0HXH03X2A5M	1	1	Not the sort of book to power through. It is profound and needs to be digested in small portions. Even if you are not interested in the prophetic, if you seriously want to hear from God and have a love for the Christian church, you would benefit from the content of this book.
A1D0HXH03X2A5M	1	1	The story of two men - an ambitious white surgeon and a gifted black carpenter turned lab technician - who together pioneered the field of heart surgery. Great movie. Really well done drama. There's a little bit of swearing and don't watch it if you don't like watching surgery because there is a little bit.
A1D0MUZRGCT8B1	0	0	I love Indiana Jones and I wanted to love this movie, but it is so poorly written and so cheesy... I had heard the buzz that it wasn't great and I went in with low expectations... and for the first twenty minutes or so, I was pleasantly surprised... yes, there was way too much superfluous dialogue, but the tone was serious and I was hopeful... but then they're in South America and the pointless dialogue starts to bog down the action and I feel boredom creeping in... then they reach the Russian camp in the jungle which is where the wheels come off... boredom increases with the poor writing and then Karen Allen pops out of a tent, as a prisoner mind you, and may as well have waved at the camera... this sets the tone for the rest of the movie with stupid, bad sitcom dialogue, absolutely no suspense, no characterization, no character arch, and set pieces that give our hero nothing to do, but move around and wink at Shia. There's no emotional connection within this film at all, no danger, no pain, no wit... It's passing entertainment of the mediocre kind... the National Treasure movies are better then this... which isn't saying a whole lot, but they are better written and nothing can save a bad script... not hundreds of millons of dollars of amazing special effects, like some embarrassing prequel movies you might have seen...This movie is such a wasted opportunity... a fantastic cast and Harrison Ford still looks amazing, but if he thinks this movie is good, he should retire. Lucas should have retired a long time ago and we (the generation that grew up loving his films and paying for his empire) will hate him for ruining are beloved heros and adventure films. Spielberg will be forgiven... where on earth was the man who made Minority Report, War of the Worlds and Munich? He obviously went along with George and he did like Last Crusade the best with it's cartoony action, undermining all suspense and coolness of our hero. At least Crusade had a decent script that didn't violate basic rules of screenwriting 101.There are good ideas within in this film... It is a good premise and it could've been a great suspenseful tale about the missing link and aliens set in the atomic age of the fifties... but it never materializes... you'll here complaints that it shouldn't have been in the 50s and that there's too much CGI and that Shia is not Indy-like at all (he's quite good in this actually), but NOTHING will destroy a film more than bad writing. It took them 19 years to come up with this script, you think it would be note perfect, or perhaps at least fantastic, or maybe just good... but no, it's just bad... and it has you know who's hands all over it... Honestly, how stupid and untalented is George Lucas at this point? If you're going to make crappy films, please make them original and stop destroying past glories.
A1D0MUZRGCT8B1	0	0	We all know Casino Royale was a return to form and loved by most people. Everyone I know was excited for Quantum. Almost all were disappointed. Some have written it felt like a coda to Casino, not a film in its own right. The story isn't nearly as good (thank you, Ian Fleming) and the action pieces were all forgettable, though constant, save for the beginning foot chase (minus over-editing).But I also think the story doesn't really feel like a continuation, at least in any satisfying way. Casino was so compelling because something was actually happening to Bond directly and emotionally (and Craig is awesome). But Quantum's wrong from its inception. Here, we get a `parallel' story: Bond meets up with a woman who's on her own revenge course, a Bolivian whose parents were murdered by a third world General. And the General's tied in with a criminal organization with the main Villian whose not even shown as responsible for Vesper's death. Mr White is the tie with him and he disappears straight away. How much more thrilling it would have been for Bond to go after those directly responsible for her death while showing him as haunted by her memory throughout (not just the sleep inducing plane scene with Mathis). Remember how driven Bond was in Casino? He should have been possessed in this, a mad chase with all the supporting cast shooting off that...The director's, Marc Forrester, only contribution to Bond will be to help strip away all cheesy-ness and the fonts of the location names as they appear on screen. Otherwise, he's a Tool. Characteristics of his Toolness: His stark visual sense, trying too hard to be cool. Hint: the locations are suppose to be appealing... maybe they could get ugly girls for the next one to really break with formula? The crappy title sequence done by his "crew." They say they love the 60s and From Russia with Love, but they made it 70s and nowhere near as good as all the recent title sequences. Coupled with the amateurish title song (derivative, depressing, lame). That opera-thing scene where he went "artistic" inter-cutting shots instead of staying with Craig, substituting suspense with pretentiousness. The final "showdown" with that 70s (stark) lair being blown up in pointless and again, yawn, suspense-less fashion.Great filmmakers would have noticed a few things: the story isn't satisfying. The parallel plot is less compelling, not helped with there being little character development or chemistry between Bond and the leading lady. The action scenes rely on editing instead of suspenseful progression. The Villian's intro at the docks isn't memorable and goes on way too long, cramming in too much story "discussion" instead of progressive scene development. The boat chase that follows goes nowhere. Mathis' intro has two back to back slow (horribly slow) scenes, which he never recovers from, causing little interest in his unmemorable death scene. The opening titles/song are dreary instead of exhilarating (what Bond films should be from start to finish). And the finale is destructive, but boring. The final scene in Russia is good... coupled with the opening foot chase and the scene with M in the Grand Hotel, you have the best bits of the film... that's it, two years and millions of dollars, and that's all you got.Producers: Please start with hiring great writers (it's a big world, they're out there!) to come up with a great story and script. Haggis is great with dialogue, so you can keep him for that. Stay with the no cheesy-ness, but keep searching for a great director. Style and substance, not style over substance. And don't take a long time, recover the momentum from Casino!
A1D0SC30UZ0UY6	1	1	It saddens me to see people getting on here, purportedly to review a book, but really to make nonfunny "jokes" about the Word of YHWH. That is so disrespectful to the purpose of this part of the Amazon website, not to mention to believers in Yahushua."A fool hath said in his heart, There is no Elohim/God."But some fools eventually find out it's better to be loved by, and to love, an Almighty Creator than to laugh at Him. It ain't smart to laugh at Him, nope, ain't smart at all.This book is great - but would be even better, for some, if combined with What If Jesus Had Never Been Born by Dr. D. James Kennedy and some books on "irreducible complexity" - for example by microbiologist Micahel Behe in Darwin's Black Box.But by itself this Book keeps on keepin' on, though it has been assailed by innumerable people down through the ages in every imaginable way. The vast majority of "them" are now gone and totally forgotten on earth. The Scriptures of YHWH - hated and beloved as always - are still here! And they teach so much, so very much - like Who gets the last and best laughs. ;-)
A1D0SC30UZ0UY6	0	0	Early on the authors of this book let us know their extreme disdain for Christianity. This didn't bother me at first, though I am a believer in Yahushua/Jesus. It is always good to get more than one perspective. But the constant sarcastic put downs of Christianity, and the presentation of themselves as understanders of the Gospel and it's impetus in history, got to be annoying really fast. Baigent & Leigh think they are knowledgeable, they present themselves as objective scholars, but they are actually very biased.It appears to me that their operating principal goes something like this: "The supernatural stories of Jesus Christ are totally mythological [this belief they cannot resist emphasizing over and over, tiresomely] i.e., lies. We know this because we assume a priori that the supernatural as it is presented in Scriptures does not exist and because we are beings who have vastly superior intellect to that of Christians. Therefore...we don't have to be too careful about our understanding of the Gospels, and can with impunity present ourselves as if we are experts on it, even though we are not at all - because you see, it's all nonsense and doesn't matter anyway!"This type of intellectual dishonesty and sloppy thinking - like for example claiming that Paul was the first one to start worshipping Yahushua (hello, how about the first chapter of John, and the Apostle Thomas bowing before His feet and saying, "My Lord/Adonai and my Elohim/God" - duh) made me realize I couldn't take seriously any "scholarship" these two have to offer. When it comes to the Dead Sea Scrolls there is so much controversy. Why should I trust these sloppy, dishonest thinkers, to tell me the real truth? Answer: I didn't and I don't.There is some purely objective fact to be found in the book - most of it known very well already. If you haven't heard those parts already, you can find them on the internet and save the money.
A1D0SC30UZ0UY6	1	1	I am giving this book 4 stars, not 5, because though I think it is excellent in it's research and clarity of thought, really it is not just about the nephilim - as one would think from reading over the descriptive info on it. The parts that are not about the nephilim were quite interesting, though.Hopefully, for the upcoming sequel, the authors will not add another one of those hideous pictures. Some say demons are attracted to things that are related to them, or that picture them. Don't know if that's true in the case of the picture on the front and back covers of Devils and Demons - but I took no chances and got out the scissors. Didn't want to look at the horrid thing anyway. I'd really prefer not to have mangled book covers though! :-(
A1D0SC30UZ0UY6	1	1	These DVDs are exactly as I was led to expect. If you love the Bible and want it in audio with a clear and pleasant voice at a normal rate of speed, with text showing as the voice speaks, get it - you'll really enjoy it! :-)

A1D10GR8EYG1PL	0	0	I bought this book after I heard it described on NPR; I thought any first novel with a title that good was worth a look. Unfortunately, the execution fails to live up to the premise. The writing is often thin, as in the frequent fictional excerpts from newspapers and magazine or journal entries in which the author's tentative voice never adapts to the tone of the purported source. The plot, which proceeds briskly, never really goes anywhere -- there are hints of sinister secrets that are simply left hanging, foreshadowing of malevolent intentions that either never surface or are frustrated too easily. The novel ends up feeling like a story that gets by on an eye-catching premise and nothing more.As a footnote, the premise never really adds up anyway. Why would anyone think that walking, talking, intelligent dogs would be the perfect super-soldier? Why not robots? Or gorillas? Or chimpanzees? Or, or, or... robots?
A1D10GR8EYG1PL	0	0	Like C. Richards, below, my ball burst after less than a year of light use. I wasn't seriously hurt, but it was a fairly ridiculous spectacle. There's no reason the material should fail so quickly if it's not being misused and abused.

A1D1NPNDZY4N3T	0	0	Don't waste your time on this one. Get Ed Tufte's first two books. Wainer spends many pages regurgitating and adulating Tufte's previously published work--unfortunately with less clarity.
A1D1NPNDZY4N3T	1	1	For those considering a smaller home, this book will challenge your sense of size. Most of the featured homes are under 500 sq ft. While this may work well in urban Japan, I think most Americans would be very hard pressed to fit two people into anything under 700-800 square ft.That said, many of the design solutions are elegant with clever ideas for spatial layouts, storage, light, and movement.Brown does a very nice job illustrating each of the selected houses with a 2 page spread of photos. The photos are followed by another 2 page spread that clearly illustrates the floor plans in lovely, hand-rendered, axonometric views. Accompanying text describes the drawings and the key innovation / "big idea" of the design. The final section of the book discusses "small" design principles for specific areas of the house.I would have given this one 5 stars, but I found myself really missing an additional 2 pages of pictures for each house so that I could really understand the spaces better.
A1D1NPNDZY4N3T	1	1	Tjader's album is smoking hot. I read the other reviews here before purchasing and can't say I disagree. This is easily one of my favorite Latin albums.The vibes are awesome and the percussion is so fast and stylish it will blow your mind.
A1D1RW0LKY44KO	1	1	A great definitive album for a seminal emo/rock band. These guys are great with musical texture and guitar arrangements. One of their downfalls is the occasional sleepiness they feel inclined to interject on their albums. There's nothing inherently wrong with pop songs or digressing a bit here and there from good ol' rock. It's just that the quieter moments don't hold my interest very much.But these moments of filler don't really bring the album down. "Lucky Denver Mint" is instantly catchy and memorable. "Believe In What You Want" showcases the band's talent for creating an engaging, anthemic melody while making it even more captivating with great harmonies. "Blister" and "Clarity" are good examples of how the band can really show their teeth by pounding on their guitars and fraying their vocal cords. It's clear that this album was a less reigned-in mile marker on the evolutionary path to their breakout, and in my opinion, superior, "Bleed American" album.When all is said and done, my main contention with "Clarity," really, is that "Goodbye, Sky Harbor" is not nearly long enough. I think I need another 25 minutes of redundant guitar arpeggios and weepy organ, and I'd be satisfied.
A1D1RW0LKY44KO	0	0	Great songwriting? Check. Great guitar-work? Check. Rockin' rhythm section? Check. Sounds like a great mix of Elvis Costello, the Clash, and Franz Ferdinand. So why the lower rating? Sorry, Ted, it's the (attempt at) singing.While parts of the album weren't so bad or perhaps even enjoyable, I just cannot get past the plethora of botched pitches. Now, heaven knows you don't need to be a great vocalist to sing rock n' roll (see any of the above mentioned bands (except maybe Franz), Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Tom Petty, Johnny Rotten, dare I even say Robert Plant, etc.). And it's not even that Ted has such a terrible voice. It's just that he sounds like he is attempting more than is possible with what God has given him. Maybe if he was more in touch with his vocal limitations it wouldn't be so bad. I know singing styles are subjective; I like Billy Corgan, but don't like Counting Crows. I don't understand why. But I am just not digging Ted's singing.On the Ballad of the Sin Eater, he sounds kind of like Weird Al covering Franz Ferdinand, but I don't think he's trying to be funny. The key change(s) in "Tell Balgeary, Balgury is Dead" assaults your ears with sounds that could only be endured by a loving parent sitting with a camcorder in the audience of a middle-school musical. In the song "Dead Voices," Ted sings "the streets are deserted, the bars are the same." Well, one of the notes he is about to kind of hit sounds like he is in one of those bars, having ingested about 10 beers, and singing karaoke to Ted Leo and the Pharmacists.
A1D29F9VPTPRL8	1	1	Finally, a down-to-earth dog training book that avoids both extremes: the jerk-'em-around/hang-'em-high approach and the stuff-'em-with-treats/lock-'em-up approach. The author explains the importance of communicating with the dog, using both reward and punishment, and adapting the training method to the dog. She even has the guts to describe the use of a remote collar to safely give a dog something she wanted with all her heart: the freedom to run, chase, hunt, and play in wide open spaces. Reeves understands that confinement (aka "management") is often far more cruel than appropriate punishment. Her book is an immensely practical, humane guide for the pet owner struggling with an ill-behaved dog. As an added bonus, she provides an outstanding explanation of Schutzhund training. Training books like this come along once in a blue moon. Grab it before the extremists try to put it out of print!
A1D29F9VPTPRL8	0	1	This book is immensely appealing to those with little experience with dogs and little knowledge about them. It makes everything so simple. All the dog needs is some really hard cracks under her chin, enough to make her scream and later cower and tremble at the sight of you. And best of all, one method fits all dogs! You never have to think about a thing. What works for an aggressive, hardheaded dog that barely notices a solid whack is exactly what you use for a sensitive, confused, frightened dog. The monks are not bothered by fine distinctions. Nor do they feel obligated to waste their time by studying and understanding different breeds and different dogs, or by carefully adapting their training methods to the dog. By throwing in a dash of smarmy psychobabble about the joy of relationships with dogs, they even manage to get credit for being "sensitive." People who understand dogs know better. Different dogs require different methods, and no dog should be brutalized into cowering and trembling at the sight of her "best friend." But many dog owners desperately want a quick fix to the problems they have created through their ignorance, neglect, or outright mistreatment of their dogs. If the dog gets hurt in the process, so much the better. Revenge is sweet. Therein lies the enduring popularity of this grotesque piece of garbage. However, before you begin to sample the pleasures of smacking your dog around and hurling her to the floor, be forewarned: Plastic surgeons have made a bundle from this book. Alpha rolls and chin bashing are an excellent way to have a sizable chunk of your face removed, which does rather take the fun out of it . . .
A1D29F9VPTPRL8	1	1	This book is a godsend for researchers and students who are struggling with complicated statistical methods like loglinear analysis, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, linear mixed models, multidimensional scaling, and many other complex procedures. Where most statistics texts are obscure, this one illuminates. It is such an unexpected pleasure to find clear writing instead of gibberish in any statistics text, but especially one that concerns advanced statistics. This book will be immensely helpful to researchers who need to use these methods in their own research or interpret published studies based on these methods. It will be equally helpfully to students in advanced statistics courses who despair of ever figuring out what the instructor is talking about. Although the book is oriented to SPSS users, it is also extremely useful to people who use other statistical software packages. I don't know of any other advanced statistics text that would be even one-tenth as helpful as this one--it's in a class by itself.
A1D29F9VPTPRL8	1	0	No, this spray won't stop every aggressive dog, but it sure stops a lot of them. I once used it to stop a bloody dogfight between four dogs, and it worked like magic--the dogs just all turned around and walked off in separate directions. No method will solve every problem, which is why backups and a variety of training tools are needed. But this is one tool that consistently works extremely well for me as a dog trainer. The spray is excellent for stopping bratty nipping, cat chasing, counter surfing, and other misbehaviors in many dogs. It does not hurt the dog at all, and often creates instant respect for the owner in the dog. The dog seems to think, "Wow! What a stink! Maybe I'll start listening better!" It often takes three or more sprays to have an effect, since a smart dog will frequently repeat the misbehavior to see if the stink will really happen again. I don't know of anything else that works so consistently well in so many situations. This spray has literally saved the lives of dogs that were so out of control that the owners were ready to dump them at the dog pound. And, again, all without hurting the dog. An outstanding product.
A1D29F9VPTPRL8	1	1	In the flood of recalled, defective, and downright dangerous products, it's a delight to find something that works as fabulously well as this pump does. It gives water the boot in a hurry! And it arrives good to go right out of the box, with no assembly required. All you have to do is screw on a regular garden hose (not included with the pump) and plug it in. It's small (mine fits in the sump pit right next to the old feeble pump), so it's a cinch to move to wherever you need it.A few things worth knowing before you fire up the pump.1. There are some instructions about starting the pump without the garden hose to avoid an air block. This is not a good idea, especially if you are inclined to hover over the pump while starting it to see if it's going to work OK. Do not ask me how I know this. (It's called "geyser" for a good reason.)2. The first batch of water that comes roaring out of the pump is oily, presumably from the well-oiled mechanism inside the pump. You wouldn't want this water dumped in your garden or on other living things.3. What about the noise? I can't imagine a pump working well without making noise, but I found it quite tolerable, perhaps because I'm so happy to hear the sound of water rushing out instead of seeping in.I can't say anything about durability because I haven't had the pump long enough, but it's been put to very hard use for a week without a single problem.A final note--bless the kind person at Amazon who overnighted the pump to me even though it was officially too late for an overnight ship to happen that day. She/he must have figured that anyone who wanted a pump overnighted really needed it. I did. The pump arrived in the nick of time and prevented a basement flood.
A1D2BCVJH74CL	1	1	Let's be clear: this is not a work of serious scholarship. It's best to see it as an extended riff on the culture and social fabric of the late middle ages. It reads like an brisk and extended (and at times distracted) conersation that uses the plague as a jumping-off point and gives a broad impression of late medieval life. It's a one-sided conversation, sure, but it's one you'll learn a lot from, even though at times it's too snarky and off-handed to be taken entirely seriously. But those qualities also work in favor of the book, making it a fun read if you don't get too distracted by the overused catch-phrases ("biomedical devastation," for example) and the gratuitous speculation. Drink a glass of wine and enjoy!
A1D2BCVJH74CL	1	1	I am biased because I saw this opera produced live in 1992, and that experience is seared in my memory . . . until William Christie and Les Arts Florissants decide to stage the opera again or release a video recording, I will have to satisfy myself with this wonderful, precise and beautiful recording. Is it possible to wear out a CD? I am not sure, but I bet I am coming close! With every listen, I can vividly remember scenes from the live production.For the listener who is not familiar with Les Arts Florissants: this is one of the truly outstanding recordings of Baroque opera. It may not be as accessible as Handel or Vivaldi, but the French Baroque composers will reward attentive listening. The length of the piece and the chromatic harmonies may be daunting, but there are some moments in the final acts that come as close as you can get to real catharsis.For some, this music may not be easy listening, and so I might recommend the recording of Charpentier's Med&eacute;e, recorded by the same group at around the same time.
A1D2BCVJH74CL	1	1	Now that Ms Hunt Lierbeson has died, it is difficult to listen to these profound recordings without feeling acute pangs of heartache, especially during the first aria of Ich Habe Genug. If you have read anything about Peter Sellars's staged versions of this cantata, where Hunt Lieberson appeared dressed in a patient's hospital gown, attached to IV's, that image will haunt you as you listen to this sublime recording. Ms. Hunt Liberson's voice is clear and supple, able to express subtle and grand emotions with small vocal inflections, gestures and delicate phrasing. A revelation of a recording that will likely bring tears to your eyes
A1D2IC4KGS8N2H	0	1	I liked that's why I gave it 2 stars. Nevertheless the documentary has obsoleted and out-of-date content. The price to me seems too pricey for the quality and the narration content; I enjoy the imaginary of the insects, you will be able to see close enough many insect, but the resolution its blurry thus details are left out.
A1D2IC4KGS8N2H	0	0	The guy pretend that he lived in the wild, well not too fast you dumb dumb, or in another words like another customer said: A "hippie" more likely it's what this is, living in the area where there's a lot of snow (where in the wild will you find a school bus and a matress to sleep- that's not wild) and a film crew with a lot of life support does NOT qualify an individual to say it's the wild where he/she lives. To me these are spolied rotten grown-up kids that had nothing better to do with their lives(and money) othar than wasting their lives, what a shame. At least they should had gone and be enlisted in the military to do something meaninful.Save your time don't watch it, even for free for the Prime Members its not worth-it the time you'll spend.
A1D2IC4KGS8N2H	0	0	the narrator uses a lot of form of speech adequately for novel and romance. Indeed my 7 years old son could not understand most of the narration because the stupid story goes like if where a Robin Hood tall tale; the music is alright if you where in a classical concert, not quite right for a "documentary" such as this one was supposed to be one.Thanks God I got this video free since I'm a premium member, otherwise I would it be mad to pay for this time waster.One star is too much rating but the system here will not allow me to rate it less than one star.Now i will have to order (since I'm already here in amazon)some Tylenol for the freaking headache I got for watching this "documentary".Don't buy this!
A1D2IC4KGS8N2H	1	1	The seat feels comfy, really like it, but looks too girly - so if you are interested in the look more than the way it feel, then consider this item to be more for a girl than for a man.Also the quality it's okay, not top of the line but decent quality, like anything else sold in USA this is a MADE in CHINA item, really affordable and good quality.I recommend it.
A1D2JN1SQJLERL	1	1	A required reading book for Asatru, Heathens, Neo-Norse and the like who want an accurate picture of the state of what we know and don't know about the northern world.The author's mastery of diverse and abundant source material on the subjects, coupled with a slightly ironic flavor of wit is quite engaging. Although not written to a audience of high school level, and needing some relevant background in the area to be understandable, the read is really enjoyable. Some common pitfalls are avoided in northern research; others pointed out and elaborated on. I especially enjoyed a bit of a rant on sociological "science" interpretive culture fictions, and the clearly well thought out critical comments on university, tourist and sociological aspects to capitalizing on northern myth and legend. Not a book for those wishing to have a light read on blood drinking sea dogs, but a serious study of all information about a long ago time and region.
A1D2JN1SQJLERL	1	1	This album caused instant street dance partys on boom boxes, BEFORE breakdancing! Yeah it dates me - but I wore out 3 cassettes of this album in collage. A dreamy, almost lucid vision of the path not ultimatly taken by the band, haunting tri-tonal evocations of vocal and synth tracks done on primative equipment. A MUST have for the 80's fan..
A1D2JN1SQJLERL	0	0	This is better used as firestarter paper. It has NO basis in any history of man on this planet, certainly. Proof postive a sucker is born every minuite is the authors rent payments being made.
A1D2JWZQZYTCVJ	1	1	Well first off, let me say that this is a FLOODLIGHT and it is advertised as such. It outputs a coarse, even beam that spreads into an evenly lit circle. It will NOT produce the typical "bright dot in the center and dim spill on the edge" beam you might expect out of a maglite or similar reflector-based flashlight.The X5 gives you a lot of great usable light for its entire beam radius and is great for close-range navigation or searching for things in the dark, but it will NOT be like a reflectored tactical light that can produce a beam visible a football field away! It was never designed to do so.What you will get is 6-hours of full brightness runtime and then another 6 hours or more of dimming light on top of that. In fact, if you have a camera or other flashlight that uses CR-123A batteries, you can even stuff their "dead" batteries into this flashlight and it'll still light up brightly. This is a great flashlight for sucking every last drop out of those expensive CR-123A cells.The use of 5 LED's also means you get a pure consistent-white beam unlike the "luxeon lottery" effect where with single-LED flashlights you can buy 5 white ones and they actually have strong blue purple green red tints to it due to manufacturing variance. The use of 5 LED's means that this all balances out. The overall color of the beam is white with a bit of a violet/blue corona, "cool white" as lightbulb manufacturers call it.It's comfortably sized and easy to hold in the hand and the momentary-on push function is effortlessly depressed , not tightly loaded like some Inovas.As with every Inova, it's made here in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty. Anytime this thing breaks, contact CS and they'll simply ask you to mail yours back and they'll send you a brand-new one.I do not have a single complaint about this device -- it's great. And I don't ever worry about this expensive investment failing in the future -- it's backed by a solid manufacturer who stands by their product.
A1D2JWZQZYTCVJ	0	0	The specs for this device indicated that it outputs DC 12V up to 1A, but that is a gross overestimation. I bought this device to power some low-current car devices, radar detectors to be exact, with current ratings around 250-300mA. Plugged one in, as soon as the thing finished initializing it shut off.Being an electrical engineering student at MIT, I took it down to lab and tested it, and found that whenever I exceeded 200mA the voltage would pulse and a bit over 300 the device cuts power entirely.This device is only good for low amperage devices, if your device is rated over 200mA I do not recommend it. I'm giving it a 1-star for its purposely deceiving specifications that describe it as capable of 5x the current draw it actually supports.
A1D2JWZQZYTCVJ	1	1	I must admit, I originally bought this as a joke with the full intention of returning it. I recently got a $100 Amazon gift card and wanted to take the opportunity to buy something crazy. I previously had a $50 multifunction shower head that I spent an hour choosing at Home Depot, so I thought I was already an extravagant shower-er if there's such a thing.The construction of the unit feels very solid. It is a solid two pound chunk metal, and makes my old shower head feel like a pathetic fisher price toy. Turning it on, I am impressed with the water pressure. Compared to my previous 2.5gpm shower head, this Speakman just feels like it is spraying so much more water. The claims of "Infinite" variability are a bit exaggerated, and even the dialed-back claim of 3 modes is a bit of a hyperbole. In reality, there's a "needles of water" mode and a "relaxing spray" mode. The so called "flood" mode feels like showering with a garden hose -- I'm not quite sure what to do with the splotchy splashes of unregulated water flow. With that said, the "infinite" variability does let you fine tune the exact amount of sharpness or flood-ness you want at the two useful modes. Coming to think of it, my old shower head had 5 modes, and several of them were close to what I wanted but either too sparse or too weak.Another difference worth noting is that each of the 8 jets output 8 separate streams of water in all directions, and this combines to make a criss cross pattern of streams that produce an even cover at any height. I've yet to experience another shower head that spreads water so consistently.I tried it with and without the flow limiter, and I think even with the flow limiter, the pressure is more than enough to make my skin tingle and rise away shampoo and body wash.As far as negatives, there's only two that come to mind. The first and foremost is the hefty price tag. This is definitely an awesome shower head, but the 6 jet version costs less than half as much and probably will be just as enjoyable. Other than that, I do miss the pulsing massage mode of my previous shower head.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	Nice model, and if you are careful, you can play with it a little. My son pretends when it falls apart that it was hit in battle. Lego's do a nice job with there Star Wars toys.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	0	1	I only received this magazine a few days ago, therefore I feel that I can not give it a proper review as of yet. What I have read was interesting. The articles are short to keep the attention span.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	0	1	I only received this magazine a few days ago, therefore I feel that I can not give it a proper review as of yet. What I have read was interesting. This Mag is a lot thinner than I remember... To be honest, the only reason I purchased this Mag is because Amazon had it on sale for $1.00!
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	Normally I am a Big Explosion, Car Chase, Adventure, Shoot 'em Up, kind of guy...This was the movie that made me rethink my movie tastes. I found it very powerful! It had a great message! Everything I received from the action movies plus more! It had control of all of my emotions! Happy, Sad, Angry, Suspense, Anxious! I will watch this movie OVER AND OVER. The best part of the movie is the credits. Most people getup and leave during these. This movie was small budget. Almost all of the help was volunteer. Grocery stores and restaurants supplied food. Babysitters, so the families could stay together during filming. The actors are common people like you and me. The acting might not be the most polished, but it is a fantastic story. I like it... I went and purchased the rest of the directors movies. "Flywheel" and Fireproof" Loved both of them too! "The Ultimate Gift" is a nice Big Budget film with the same type of message. I checked out these movies from my local Library first, then purchased them from Amazon. Thank you for letting me ramble... Hope this helps.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	The worlds greatest John Wayne movie ever produced In all of its Technicolor glory! The fires are great. It is really a great "Period" movie. Classic like Airport, or Towering Inferno, it used the latest technologies of the time to deal with the danger, yet it is way out dated for today's standards. Like Shag carpet, avocado appliances, and dark wool paneling.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	This is a fun Action/Drama. I look forward to watching it every week. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	A little close to real life for me... I found it real entertaining. Action intense. The amount of "Jiggle cam" filming is tolerable.
A1D2S1C6MRV445	1	1	Quirky Fun! This series is a fun Sci-Fi/Comedy that is light and potentially believable. It helps lighten the mood after a hard day of work. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
A1D3539CNJY0VX	0	0	I was dissapointed in Icebound. This may have been a fair book for many writers, but I expect more from Dean Koontz. This was a mild and boring attempt. Not what readers have come to expect from Dean Koontz.
A1D3539CNJY0VX	1	1	These are a great looking pair of boots and they are extremely comfortable. I put them on and they fit like a glove.
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	0	0	Great learning tool my 3-yr. loves - but the screen stopped responding after only 2 weeks completely! Luckily, I'm still within my exchange time frame - this toy is potentionally so neat - why can't they make it last??
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	1	1	My daughter loves Teen Titans and this is one of the better toys we've bought in the series. The figures are rougly the same size as the other figures (Scooby Doo People, Batman, etc.) she has so they all work together for pretend play. The car transforms easily after I showed her how to lift the hood to find the driver's seat. The legs, arms and heads can pull off on these figures so I super-glued them. Well, except Robin's...she liked him better without his head so he's the headless specter now. A fun toy overall & great for imaginative play. This set includes the car, Robin & his motorcycle. When I purchased this I had to buy two sets to get all of these items at more cost, so a good value.
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	1	1	It is true that none stand except Scooby and a couple can sit well and the others not (oh, and I also know since the are my child's bathmates too that some float and some don't). Yet, the arms and legs bend on all of the characters and they have been my daughter's constant companions for over a year. She has a ton of fun role-playing with them. She has carried these everywhere (and the traditionally-clothed set of the same). They are the perfect size to tuck into a purse or pocekt or go for a ride. They play well in Barbie's house, always on their best manners and get along quite well with all of the Teen Titans people. If your child is a fan of this series and especially if they are into imaginative play and smaller hand-size toys, they will surely love these too. Once they do fall in love with their new friends, buy a second set for safe-keeping. (and if you ever see Daphne at a rest stop in Georgia, please let me know; we've been missing her).
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	1	1	This is a cute book for a younger Disney princess lover. It is not very long and is not set-up as stories to read (other than a short synopsis introducing each princess)but rather random facts about each character. For $10, it isn't so much for a large hardcover book your toddler will love to flip through on occasion. If you are looking for princess stories to read together, try another book.
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	1	1	My daughter enjoys this set. The small books are sturdy but the box is a bit weak. The stories represented are: Aladdin, Cinderalla, Beauty & the Beast, The Little Mermaid & Snow White. Be advised that if you little one is a major Sleeping Beauty fan like mine, that she is not included.The stories themselves are rather wordy, not the shorter versions you would expect from the small books. They are too long & detailed for my 3-year old, but I just shorten it to my own version as she looks at the pictures.Because they are slim and small, my daughter has enjoyed toting these around with her as they fit in many of her purses, etc.
A1D3NBGL55L8P7	1	1	There are bright, colorful pop-ups that are sturdy on every page of this book. The pops perform an 'action' on most pages to by moving a tab or moving the cover. My preschooler loves this book and the stories are appropriate length and vocabulary for the under 8 set.
A1D3Z734MF1OJL	1	1	Godlike. A landmark metal album. I wholeheartedly disagree with the negative comments about "Christ Illusion". This is as solid as thrash gets. Every song here combines brutality along with prime songcraft. The end result is one hell of a release. Possibly the best metal album EVER. Slayer forever!
A1D3Z734MF1OJL	1	1	"Terminal Area" is a best-of, of sorts, from this occasionally great Denver band. I couldn't have felt stronger about it 1995, and today it still holds up. Loud guitars, melodic riffs, heavy drumming, mumbled lyrics. Stylistically the band showed quite a range here (indie rock/thrash/experimental), but with a noticeable concentration on hooks. Worth your time.
A1D3Z734MF1OJL	1	1	The ZZ Top grunge album, of all things, and it's fantastic. Overall, I find this to be one of the most appealing albums the band ever made. Saturated guitar tones, royally overdriven bass, superb drum sounds - "Mescalero" is a bigtime treat to hear. The songs are very groovy, very fun, and very, very distorted. This album is awesome, and kind of f**ked up, actually. Texas has had its share of ever-unique musicians, and here's another fine example that proves you never know what they'll do next. Recommended!
A1D3Z734MF1OJL	0	1	This DVD starts strong. Discharge, GBH, and The Exploited all demonstrate why it is that you're watching this (the history of 80's U.K. punk) by turning in some strong performances. Unfortunately, that's about all the video has to recommend itself, and the quality of the music pretty much jumps off a bridge after that. I must admit that I think much less of Toy Dolls, Peter And The Test Tube Babies, and Anti-Nowhere League after watching this - and those are some pretty big names. The lesser-known bands here range from uninteresting to incompetent, with some moments of Benny Hill-inspired punk that are just about unwatchable. I have listened to Crass compilation albums from the 80's, so I know that there was good stuff going on in the U.K. at the time. This DVD not only doesn't capture it, but had me squirming to turn off the TV most of the time.
A1D3Z734MF1OJL	0	0	Gross! Whatever happened to William H. Macy? I guess ever since he displayed his buttocks in "The Cooler" he has just gotten increasingly unseemly. And the hag who plays his daughter on this show - yuck. The whole program makes me gag. Something about it actually smells from the TV. If it weren't for "Homeland", Showtime would be totally worthless. Hate this show.
A1D469V68X9PFL	1	1	I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara
A1D469V68X9PFL	0	0	I am an avid adventure story reader. I was looking forward to hearing about Alaska and living on the land, instead this book is about a young idealistic man who is pitiful. I was disappointed to hear of this person's total disregard for the forces of nature who actually allowed himself to starve and perish through his own non efforts. Everyone dreams of an adventure,luckily most of us are more realistic in pursuing it. I could not even finish this book.
A1D4DDXJRZKXEG	1	1	Well What can I sayMy little boy says every time he comes in the room he wants to watch DinosaursSo im not the only one who likes this one
A1D4DDXJRZKXEG	0	0	I have watched this 2 times in 3dAnd yes I thought I would give it a second chance , But yes like the first time I wasent impressed
A1D4E8SDPRJTVF	1	1	A good thriller/mystery. The 1970s slang is entertaining. By the end of the novel you will want to try the red pill.
A1D4E8SDPRJTVF	1	1	Asimov matches Agatha Christie in writing mystery. Combine that with science fiction and you get a superb novel like The Naked Sun.
A1D4E8SDPRJTVF	1	1	A majestic novel, the type that you hope will never end. IMO the best historical fiction ever written and one of the best novels period.
A1D4E8SDPRJTVF	1	1	These are plenty big for my 75 lb dog and he craps a lot. They are about a thousand times better than the dollar store bags!
A1D4EUIF3LEFR4	1	1	It is a great book that is well written and has factual information that is amazing. If you are interested in quantum mechanics or a more factual explaination of metaphisics, Get this book.
A1D4EUIF3LEFR4	1	1	I really liked the information. I wish she had focused more on the information vs. her struggles as a scientist in a male dominated field. When she did share information on the evolution of findings on the subject, it was very interesting.
A1D4EUIF3LEFR4	0	0	Very disappointing because I never received it. When I contacted the supplier they never responed either.
A1D4J7D91LSXZ4	1	1	I bought this book on a whim as we started the PT-process, mainly because it was cheap. Little could I have known it would be the leading help in my daughter getting the idea! She loved the book, loved that Hannah was independent with some things and learning some things (just like her), and sometimes had accidents while learning, also just like her. We read it so many times my daughter memorized it, and even though she's been potty-trained for nearly a year now, it's still one of her favorites!
A1D4J7D91LSXZ4	1	1	What can be better than Cinderella? It's remastered, brightened and beautified, and I still get chills when Cindy pulls the glass slipper out of her pocket and says "But *I* have the other slipper." Magical!
A1D4LOBQFWWWCH	1	1	This English-made chamois far exceeded my expectations. The overall quality is excellent. The thickness is just right -- not flimsy at all. Comparably priced chamois are thin and ragged. The 4 sq ft size is large enough to absorb plenty of water but not too large where it is difficult to manage.Thanks to Meguiar's for bringing this product to market. And thanks to Amazon for selling such a great product at an unbeatable price.
A1D4LOBQFWWWCH	1	1	These pillowcases are big, soft, thick, and luxurious. And at this price they are a great deal. I bought both the white and the cafe. Thanks, Amazon.
A1D4LOBQFWWWCH	1	1	I purchased this filter sight unseen for my 2009 Honda Civic based on the Denso reputation for good quality. This is a good oil filter. It feels substantial. The canister is thick and the rubber gasket is pliable. I purchased this filter along with the Purolator PureOne oil filter and I am impressed more by the Denso filter. I will purchase more Denso filters in the future. Thanks to Amazon for offering this product and at a great price. Cheers.This filter fits all Hondas that take the Honda filter Part# 15400-PLM-A01 or AO2. The fit chart at the Denso site shows this but Amazon hasn't updated its fit chart. This fits all cars that the Purolator 14610 filter fits.
A1D4LOBQFWWWCH	1	1	This is one heck of a deal from Amazon and Wiha. German products are top notch and at this price this set is a no-brainer. The grips fit my small/medium hands perfectly. The soft texture and ergonomic shape keep my hand from slipping. The tips are precise and beautifully finished. This is a wonderful set that is made in Germany by a quality-driven company.
A1D4R48PJPSUUV	1	1	My 9-year old grand daughter loved it. I loved it when I was nine. He doesn't just talk to the animals, he talks to the loving impulse in all of us, especially kids.
A1D4R48PJPSUUV	1	1	A Hannukah present for my 9-year old grand daughter. I love the Dr when I was that age and hoped that she would too. She devoured it. We all have something to learn from the human and humane Dr. D.
A1D51KOTL80VOY	1	1	for those of us who've followed Barry Manilow throughout his varied career, HERE AT THE MAYFLOWER is a homecoming in every sense of the word. This is barry's first original album in ten years, and it was definitely worth waiting for. Each song is a peek behind the door of one of the residents of a fictional apartment complex called The Mayflower. The musical styles on this album are as varied as the residents themselves--from wistful ballads such as BORDER TRAIN and SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE to the humorous and upbeat COME MONDAY and FREDDIE SAID, to the broadway-like NO ONE IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE and I MISS YOU, HERE AT THE MAYFLOWER offers something for everyone. and through it all, Barry showcases his stellar songwriting with a voice which is as fine and clear today as it was thirty years ago. I greatly enjoyed the retrospective and tribute albums he's put out in the last ten years, but this is barry at his best!!!
A1D51KOTL80VOY	0	0	This album is without a doubt the most repulsive thing I have ever heard. These poorly executed renditions of Carpenters songs blatantly spit on the memory of one of the greatest singers who ever lived. Shame on anyone who had anything to do with this travesty that calls itself a tribute! If you loved The Carpenters and were thinking of buying this album because you thought it would do justice to their legacy, don't bother. Hearing the butchery of their music will only break your heart, or make you so angry you can't see straight. If you've always hated The Carpenters and enjoy making fun of them, then, by all means, buy this album and revel in its awfulness, get out your guitar or your kazoo or whatever, learn the songs, and see if you can possibly perform them any worse than the artists on this album do. (Odds are pretty good you can't.) And, if you have an eating disorder and wish to get better, don't buy this album; once you hear it you'll probably never eat again. The only place this album belongs is in a landfill.
A1D51OAY297HW	1	1	Love this powder. I start my day with it every day. I prefer plain, no flavor powder because I add my own flavor with fresh or frozen fruits. Everyone should start their day with Vega.
A1D51OAY297HW	1	1	I need to understand the numbers of our companies, though I am not directly involved with them. This book gives me the understanding I need to look at the basic numbers and know where the finances are heading.
A1D51OAY297HW	1	1	Love this book. I have 11 employees so I love to read about leadership. This book is full of fundamentals that are important in everyday communication, not just with employees or employers, but with anyone.I highly recommend this as a very easy, very informative read.
A1D56FZH2GMVGA	0	1	As of this writing, the slipcase shown in the picture at Amazon for the Blu-ray essentials edition has the words "30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition" printed on the slipcase, which of course implies that the Blu-ray you would receive has the same content as the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition. This is NOT correct! The disc I received did not have the 30th anniversary text on the outer or inner cases, and does not contain any of the special features included with the Ultimate Edition. Very deceptive, and I will be returning mine.This edition does appear to have all three versions of the movie (theatrical, special edition, director's cut), so if all you want is the movie itself and if you can get it at a significant discount to the Ultimate Edition, then it might be an option. Otherwise, I would definitely opt for the 30th anniversary edition which at the moment is actually quite a bit cheaper than this watered-down edition!!!
A1D56FZH2GMVGA	1	1	For the sale price I paid, I wasn't expecting this to be as nice as it is. Very sturdy. I haven't had the opportunity to use it very much yet, but out of the box and after one night of use it clearly is a great product that works as advertised. Pointing the binocular up and down could be a bit nicer (some sort of fluid-damped tilt mechanism would be perfect), but panning and, most importantly, adjusting the height of the binocular for different viewers while staying trained on the same object are both buttery smooth as-is.A couple things to be aware of:It is *heavy*. I had planned to use this with a fairly heavy-duty tripod I already had (rated at 15lb capacity). On paper, this mount plus my 3lb binocular should have been OK on this tripod. Well, it sort of works, but the tripod is at its max rating and the result is an image that bounces for quite awhile after you let go. So I've had to buy another tripod to provide good support. I went with a heavy-duty video model rated at 25# that has crutch-style legs. I was able to find an inexpensive, lightly used one on ebay, but if I had it to over again, I'd have just purchased this with the XHD tripod that Orion pairs it with. That one looks very similar to the one I purchased separately and to me it would be worth it to have the matching set.It is *big*. Storing this when not in use should factor into your consideration. Portability also - this thing weighs a lot and carrying it around in the box is not ergonomic. I'm thinking of building some type of box with two built-in casters that allow moving it around like a dolly. Also the heavy-duty tripod required to support this will not fold down to a tiny package like most camera tripods that people are used to dealing with.My only other "complaint" is that I wish it was rated to carry a heavier binocular than 5lb. Some people do this anyway, but after seeing what happened when pushing my tripod to its limit I am not inclined to do the same to the mount. But Orion doesn't mischaracterize its capabilities, so I can't mark them down for wanting more from than they advertised. Especially at this price point.
A1D56FZH2GMVGA	0	0	I was swayed by the low price and many good reviews here, which caused me to ignore the advice of astronomy experts which were pointing me to better-quality options from Oberwerk, Orion, and even Zhumell.If you are lucky, you might get a good pair of these that stays in collimation for awhile. If you are lucky, you might get a good pair of these that allow you to bring both tubes in focus at the same time. If you are lucky, you might get a pair of these that doesn't have horribly horrible chromatic aberration in one tube. I was't lucky. I sent mine back. I should have listened to the experts. I bought a Zhumell 25x100 instead, which is significantly better than this in *every* way, except that it cost and weighs twice as much. But it works.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	Other reviewers have said everything to be said about the sockets themselves. But, the size of the carrying case is beyond ridiculous. Most of us would expect to put a 14-piece socket set into a tool-chest drawer. Not these. They come in a case that could easily hold a 140-piece socket set.The quality of the carrying case is quite good. However, it's so large that I plan to remove the sockets and cut the molded part out and use it as a tool box for larger tools. As for the sockets, I plan to buy a socket holder and store them in my tool-chest.By the way, if you need a good 6pt 1/2 drive socket set that's not "impact" class, consider the Pittsburgh set at Harbor Freight. When on sale, it's under $20. However, that set excludes some sizes such as 21mm that are incomprehensible.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I have this knife and like it very much for all the reasons most others have already posted. However, I also have the "Bessey DBKPH Quick-Change Folding Utility Knife - PVC Handle with 5 Blade Storage Compartment" knife and prefer that knife even more.Granted, the DBKPH knife does not have the more durable and nicer looking woodgrain. But,it does have a rubber thumb-rest that the woodgrain version does not. Plus, the 5 blade compartment is convenient when you need to change a blade out.You won't go wrong with either. However, if I had to buy another, it would be the DBKPH model.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	0	0	I am an IT professional who has purchased many hardware items for over 30 years. This may be the most surprising for two reasons:1. The number of good reviews it gets.2. Logitech, generally known for good devices, would brand its name on this unit.Construction - is poor however on par with the price point.Keys - very poor and a cheap feel to them.Range - now here's where it falls flat to the unacceptable level. I contacted Logitech about the range which is only about 4 feet. To my shock and amazement, Logitech states this is the acceptable operating range of this unit. This was confirmed by their own website:[...]Now, if someone needed a max range of only 4 feet, wouldn't a corded model do?Conclusion - Logitech should simply be embarrassed of putting it's name on this one. It tarnishes an otherwise good reputation.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	0	I have had this product for years. I store it in a plastic sealed jar and it's always ready when I am to use it. Mixed evenly, you have about 10 working minutes to use it and it sets up in about 20 minutes with a minimum curing time of about 24 hours. Pretty good stuff although I would never buy it again from the off-the-wall hardware store in NY (can't remember who) that originally sold it.I bought a case and they send one package. They claim there was a listing error and didn't offer a refund. Poor customer service, although you can't say that about Amazon.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	Ok, it's not every day that you think to provide a review on boots, but, after the snowfall we've had in the Baltimore area this past winter of 2010, I was able to think about many things I had never thought of before. One, of course, was how much I appreciated the boots I had been wearing for at least the past ten winters. They aren't exactly like these shown, but, the closest match I could find.1. over 10 years, the boots have held up and held up well, albeit I haven't worn them that much.2. the fit is excellent. I slip my foot in these with no hand help and they feel snug. I'm able to take them off just the same; no help from my hands. This may seem trivial, but, when you're going in and out of the garage this is a plus.3. they are totally water proof; hard to question this since they are one piece rubber all the way up (or at least it seems to be).4. most importantly, they are incredibly warm. I have stayed outdoors in these for as much as 6 hours straight and can only say that my feet sometimes feel too warm if anything. I have no idea how they do it, but, it's the way it is.I highly recommend these boots. I think I bought them at Dick's Sporting Goods back in the late 1990s and am ready to buy a pair for my two adult sons. Good product. I only wish I could find a pair of gloves that I can say the same about. If anyone knows of any, please leave a comment.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I have both this and the GB 65' snake. Both are very well made and work as advertised. In comparison, the Klein version sold at Home Depot is junk (I had it and returned it).Whereas the GB works well within its case, the Klein version will jam before you can unwind 6 ft. of wire.Get the GB; you'll be glad. By the way, the 65' GB has a thicker wire (needed for longer pushes) than the 25' which is a little wider and thinner. Well thought out designs on both.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	Not much more to add that others haven't already said. I bought mine refurbished and although not cosmetically perfect; close enough and once used you'll never know. Good purchase and CPO provides good customer service.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	0	0	This is made for a youth portable unit held down by sandbags. The backboard is made of flimsy plastic that easily gives when impacted by a ball. If for child's use, you'll likely be satisfied although the components are cheap. The net is made of poor quality string and the rim fits sloppily within the spring-loaded break-away bracket.This is not for an adult court and it should have been better described.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	0	No complaint about the product; I only wished I had purchased the reverse-able version which I thought I was buying based on the picture (which seems to show the reverse-able switch; however, it's actually a shadow). After looking closer at the picture, it was my carelessness and fault.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	Excellent quality; thick nylon rope that lays very nicely. The quality is as good as you could expect. You won't be disappointed.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	0	I bought a few sets of these and the "Moving Men" version.These out of the box appear a little thicker and well-made than the Moving Men version. However, the Moving Men version appear to be a bit more pliable. The Waxman version, after being used under heavy furniture, appear creased after use.My suggestion is to buy whichever costs less. These are great if you're replacing carpet; they work great on carpet. One side has a slick plastic surface (floor side); the other has a dense foam rubber (furniture side). The two pieces are glued together.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	Nice shower head; just note it is about 6 times the size of a standard shower head. When you receive it, your first reaction will be, "wow, look at the size of this thing!".With that said, the shower head works great, the spray is evenly dispersed over a large area that will cover most large body people (I am 6'1", 225lb and the shower works perfectly for me). My wife is half my size and likes even more than I do. I find I never have to adjust the shower head as I had with the original standard unit.I removed the water-saver cog and although it dispenses more water per minute, my showers take 1/2 the time than they used to. Installation is simple and requires no plumbing tape or sealant; it simply screws onto your existing shower arm by hand and seals with a washer (you may want to tighten 1/4 turn using a pair of pliers to prevent future leaks). The most difficult part of installing this shower head is removing the old shower head, which generally can be done with a pair of pliers (note, you may need a second pair of pliers to prevent the shower arm from loosening).As for the predictions of some that this won't last; based on my observation and experience, I see no basis for such statements. Provided you simply turn the shower on and off, and, you don't have calcium in your water that will clog any shower head; this unit should provide years of trouble-free service. If not, I'll be the first to post an update.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I used these with kiln-dried 2x12 from Home Depot. I suggest you be patient and look for light-weight, well dried lumber. It will make it easier for you to handle. Pressure treated boards will be quite heavy after you've added the end pieces.For easier handling, you may want to cut 1" x 5" handle holes near the center of the boards (leave 1-1/2" of material on the outer edge). I say near the center because you should temporarily afix the end pieces on the lumber first and then determine the true center based on weight. Then you can cut your handle holes. Otherwise, the boards will not be balanced when carrying them.If this doesn't make sense, just cut the handle holes about 1" from board center toward the heavier end piece - that should take care of the weight balance. You may want to sand the handle hole edges for a smooth handle finish.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I have a 1975 Schwinn Continental bike. Yes, old school. However, compared to bikes being sold today; not far off the competition. So instead of replacing the bike, I decided to replace the tires and tubes. The original tires on this bike were Kenda 27" x 1-1/4" tires. I up-sized to the 27" x 1-3/8" tires and tubes with the hope of getting a little softer ride now that I'm 35 years older than when I bought the bike. The old Kenda tires (exactly the same composition of the new tires) never dry-rotted. One did develop a flat spot from sitting so long (and hence why I replaced them).I had no problems with fit, it does provide a slightly softer ride, and without any noticeable difference in tire size to the eye. The front tire change couldn't have been easier and faster. Of course, as with any bike, the rear took longer to deal with the chain and the rear wheel gear sprocket; still reasonably easy. Neither front nor back tire change required brake removal if you deflate the tires before removing the rim.Just a quick plug for the old 1975 Schwinn Continental; the gears are still as smooth as silk and the ride is pretty nice.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I bought this for the digital clutch. It works as advertised. I had to dismantle and reinstall a number of kitchen cabinet hinges and knobs. The digital clutch made this job quick, easy, and most of all took all of the guess work out of the torch. Perfect installation.If you need precision for tasks such as mounting brackets, hinges, ..., this is the impact driver for you. I have another a Hitachi driver and although it has power, it will also driver a screw through the wood if you're not careful. Not the Panasonic; once the clutch is set, it takes care of the rest. It also has a handy feature of being able to provide a little extra torch if you need it. The device won't let drive a screw beyond the set point (unless you turn off the clutch mechanism).Tool is recommended.
A1D57TSKTBBBJN	1	1	I like these a lot. The quality control of the tips coming together is not perfect, but, pretty close. Still, a nice plier.
A1D5C8NRF7PS2P	1	1	This season was so fantastic! The writer really made me want to reread Revelation just to see how close he was making this story line. The new characters were funny and annoying (ie. "bad" angels) at the same time. Castiel and Chuck are the best! Sam and Dean have really developed their characters to a level I never thought possible. This is worth the investment. In fact, I purchased the download last season and then bought the box set this year as a gift for my daughter! I do recommend you start with Season 1. There is such character development between Sam and Dean through the seasons. I love this show!!!
A1D5C8NRF7PS2P	1	1	I finally broke down and purchased this movie. I have to admit, if it weren't for Patrick Dempsey I might not have ever watched it. WELL, this movie is great! The music is wonderful, the cast is superb, and the comedy is really funny. Both kids and adults alike will enjoy this movie. I am very happy that I bought Enchanted and will watch it over and over for a long time to come.
A1D5C8NRF7PS2P	1	1	I had to watch this movie twice before I understood it. I really enjoyed it...the acting is great and it is a wonderful thriller. Just be prepared to pay attention. No getting up for a drink or trip to the bathroom. You need to stay focused...or watch it over again. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that play with your mind.
A1D5C8NRF7PS2P	1	1	Really like Amanda Seyfried and she does a wonderful job in this mystery thriller. Worth the watch for sure!You will be glad you did.
A1D5C8NRF7PS2P	1	1	I really love the cast and think this is a great edge of your seat movie. Have watched multiple times and never gets boring!!
A1D5F0L4HYKCX1	0	0	This was, without a doubt, the grossest shake I've ever tried. I used their shaker, and after nearly five minutes of vigorous shaking it STILL had chunks in it. Don't even think of trying to drink it out of the shaker's drinking spout... it's so thick it won't move... and not in a good way, in a like-the-stuff-you-clean-out-of-the-tub-drain way. To add insult to injury? It's GREEN! I'm not even kidding... it's a chunky, bubbly, thick mess of green that is totally gross. Waste of money.
A1D5F0L4HYKCX1	0	1	Not that any of these shakes taste great, but this is just nasty. They say it 'dissolves instantly'... I'm not sure how they define instantly because I put it in their shaker with skim milk and shook for nearly five minutes and it was still chunky. It was gross to start with, but with chunks it made me gag.
A1D5F0L4HYKCX1	1	1	I've had this a full year now so I thought it may be about time to write a review... I've been through A LOT of feeders claiming to be squirrel proof (ha!) this is the only one I've ever had that deters them. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because the cardinal ring perch is poorly designed, mine keeps falling off even though I assembled it just as directed. Tired of fishing it out of the yard, I finally left it off... kind of a bummer, because now the cardinals don't come to that feeder very often because the pegs aren't quite long enough for them. But... it definitely stands up to it's squirrel-proof claims. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. Happy birdwatching!
A1D5F0L4HYKCX1	1	1	I hesitated a bit on this after reading some of the less enthusiastic reviews... glad I went ahead and purchased it. We've always had at least three cats at any given time and this thing is awesome! Not just because it has a large capacity... but it's also big enough for them to get in, move around and find a spot without getting crowded and doing their business on the side of (or worse, outside) the box. I thought the holders on the side would be more of a pain than anything... but they work great for holding the scooper I bought (can't remember the name... it's a large metal one, don't buy anything else... the plastic ones are awful!). The litter box area is generally cleaner since I set this up... I'd definitely recommend it to another cat enthusiast.
A1D5JP77PYCUAA	1	1	These bags allow you to quickly sterilize your breast pump and/or bottle accessories easily using the microwave. (Plus anything microwaveable -- pacifiers, sippy cup tops, etc.) Each can be used about 20 times, so a box feels like a good value.
A1D5JP77PYCUAA	0	0	My husband bought this for its digital presentation, given that standard timers often make a slight buzzing noise that annoys him. Unfortunately, this product never worked -- we charged it per the instructions and still never got any sort of screen read-out. We returned for a refund; husband is determined to live with the buzzing of our low-tech timer.
A1D5JP77PYCUAA	1	1	This book is good for little ones learning colors, practicing identifying animals and their sounds, and understanding how not to wear clothing (a coat isn't worn arms first, for example). There really isn't any narrative -- each page contains just four examples of an item of clothing in four different colors, one inevitably worn incorrectly ("Blue hat, green hat, red hat, oops!) -- and I miss the fun of Barnyard Dance, but this is still a fun, educational book.
A1D5LPG3IJ6AK0	1	1	We have had this for over a year and my son still loves the sounds. It soothes him when he goes to sleep. It still works as it did when it was new. We have had no problems with it. We will be buying another for our daughter when she is born.
A1D5LPG3IJ6AK0	0	0	This thing has not worked correctly since we opened it. It does not open the cans all the way. Would have done better getting one of the old fashioned manual one. This thing will be placed in the garbage. Don't waste your money on this. It might make a some what useful paper weight.
A1D5LPG3IJ6AK0	1	1	The Bears football I received is not the same as pictured. The one pictured is all blue and mine is blue and orange. I still like the football, but thought future buyers should not you may not receive the one pictured. My son loves it too. I bought him a plain brown football and he would rather play with the Bears football.
A1D5PZJY0DWBP9	1	1	This book has songs and rhymes from years ago that even my parents remember. What a resource for preschool teachers!
A1D5PZJY0DWBP9	1	1	My grandson loves books and the repeating pattern in this book is fantastic for teaching pre-literacy skills. It is the first thing Tony does when he comes to Grandma's,ask for "Dum ditty dum".
A1D5T8VGA4ZLIJ	0	0	do not pay ANY amount of money for this CD. It is like listening through a wall.
A1D5T8VGA4ZLIJ	0	1	I have been using it coiled up for the meantime behind my HDTV setup. Currently I don't need to use the full length, so I am only running about 6 feet of it. That said, it gets some pretty annoying signal noise, so I have taken to not using it. I guess you get what you pay for.
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	1	1	I had been looking for this CD for a long time. I had it in cassette form but I wanted to switch over plus I just bought an Ipod so Im glad that I was able to find it. The music is has very good spiritual messages and upbeat. Also listen to this music while working out at the gym.
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	1	1	I love the whole album. Anything Journey puts out it is always good to me. The first song really fast pace you can hear the words very clear "Message of Love". The best song on the album and a lot of radio play "When you love a women". Like the other song you can hear the words on this song. Well the whole album is great the sad thing is if I am correct this was the last album of the former Journey. So at least I will have something to listen to for years to come. Thanks Amazon!! :-)
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	1	1	I had the first Volume of Led Zeppelin which I had bought from another company long ago but when I was able to see this on Amazon I just had to buy it. I was so happy because I had been looking for the cd about a year I would say. So THANK YOU AMAZON for having this available so that I had could add to my collection of CD's.
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	1	1	I had been looking for a product like this for years but I hadn't seen one in the regular stores. Just happen to be on Amazon (as always) and I found the stocking organizer. it fits perfect in my closet. I totally was really really happy and it has a lot of room for my stockings or I can put my scarfs in there also if I want. Thank You to the company that was selling it and Thank You to Amazon for being the BEST SITE to buy anything that you need or want. :-)
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	1	1	Really enjoy the songs that is on this album. I love Montgomery and Gentry it is real quality of music. Also the CD very good condition no problems at all.
A1D5VMDK4J8PHK	0	0	I bought a cassette(Happy holidays to you by The Whispers) and thought I was getting a cd but I bought the wrong item. Tried to contact the seller but to no succcess. So the customer service rep. has signed me up for the a-z program. So this experiniece was not good. ButI will be paid back the amount owed.
A1D5XWA4PRTJ73	1	1	Good vs Evil in Mexico. A great ending to the El Mariachi Trilogy! DVD was in great condition, thank you!
A1D5XWA4PRTJ73	0	0	Was disappointed with this hat, bought it for my amazing costume and not only did it not fit, it doesn't look like it could even fit a child's head properly. Flimsy and poorly made. I agree with another comment I saw, &#34;Death Frisby.&#34; Not worth the price. Might work on an ugly scarecrow thing, maybe.
A1D6FEBWIM4EPB	1	1	Best Episode EVER. I know, I've said that before, but now I can't remember when. :)But this one is priceless!!!
A1D6FEBWIM4EPB	0	0	Offensive use of media to enrage the ignorant. There is nothing credible about this film. It is typical political extremism and if you or any of your cohorts believe this, you are already sadly misinformed. Find a legitimate source of information and start over.
A1D6FEBWIM4EPB	1	1	I loved this movie. Understand, I am not a devotee of the genre, it was sometimes a little hard to follow (totally expected that), and now that I find out it was cut, gee that explains why an entire battle was missing. LOL!!!But the story is a Classic Tragedy in every way, the film was beautifully made, the acting was superb. It's heart wrenching, but well presented and I understood the nature and motivation of each of the main characters. General Pang was brilliant, driven, at moments a little mad, but he had a vision. The tragedy that eventually came from his actions was oddly a lesson for today.The poor reviews I've read here on Amazon made me think that a lot of people just didn't understand what they were seeing, they somehow missed the real struggle. The characterization of General Pang (Jet Li) a villian is not accurate. He was obsessed with being right but terribly misguided, and you know that from the tone of the narrator from early on.There is a samarai movie called Samarai Twilight that a reviewer rated very badly, because it took him half the movie to realize there were no vampires. Funniest review I EVER saw. But that wasn't a reflection on the film, now was it? Same on this one. Yes, I guess it was cut, but the movie is supberb.(4 stars only because it was cut)
A1D6IX2FKJ6A0O	0	0	I have read Clives first novel "Dando on Dehli Ridge", and expected to be entertained with his second book on the Imperial British soldier Joseph Dando, what a disappoinment. The first novel was full of the daily life and routine of being a member of Her Majesty's infantry,the training, discipline, and weapons that help young British soldiers slaughter thousands of lesser equipped and trained combatants throughout the third world. This second work on young Dando is a "waste of paper". Please save your money.
A1D6IX2FKJ6A0O	0	0	Any one who purchase's this work of obvious fiction should be prepared to be extremly disappointed. As an avid reader of military history I found this work to be nothing more then a high priced rip off. This is a subject that is well hidden in French military documents due to political implications, but to tease those readers interested in what happened to those members of the SS who disappeared into the Indochina theater is nothing less then almost criminal intent.I had great hope that this would be a well written work on Legion incorporation of SS members, but this was not the case. Please save your money, this is nothing more then comic book nonsense.
A1D6IX2FKJ6A0O	1	0	Excellent work, very well written with a strong emphasis on Soviet Army criminal actions in Eastern Prussia and Berlin. For many years Americans have had to put up with the nonsense of the heroic Soviet infantrymen who saved the world from the Nazis.Truth be told the constant attacks on German civilians merited criminal prosecution. Some may say that the Germans got what was coming to them, but if that is the case let a world court decide on the collective punishment.This is a good read for those interested in the Eastern Front. Read Beevor's Stalingrad first then this.
A1D6NHB34ZUEZD	1	1	If you want to get a copy of Britney Spears' album, "Britney," then this is DEFINITELY the one to get. This is the ONLY version of "Britney" that includes ALL 3 of the following bonus tracks: "Before The Goodbye," "I Run Away," and "When I Found You." Plus, it still has the enhanced portion with the "Crossroads"-outtakes "Overprotected" video like on the original U.S. version. PLUS, I don't know if this version was possibly re-mastered, but to me the music sounds cleaner and fuller than on the original U.S. version. I even compared the two to make sure it wasn't my imagination. I definitely recommend buying this CD; and I also recommend accompanying it with the single of "I'm A Slave 4 U," which includes the other bonus track from the "Britney" sessions, "Intimidated," for the complete "Britney" experience.
A1D6NHB34ZUEZD	0	0	The one redeeming quality of this CD is that when you compare the tribute artist's singing to Britney's, you realize, if you hadn't already(unless you honestly DON'T have an ear for music), that Britney Spears IS a talented singer. It is an illegitimate assessment to state that Britney can't sing simply because you don't like Britney's original, quirky style, as ability and style are truly two different things. When you compare the tribute artist's emotionless, monotone voice (I'm quite sorry, whoever you are) to Britney's vocals, you realize Britney is quite talented, after all.
A1D6O5NRU8ZB4R	1	1	I purchased this mower 6 years ago when I bought my first house. I have a small yard (which has only gotten smaller as I have converted it to garden) and it mows quickly. I would not recommend the mower for large yards. I can't imagine trying to mow my parents' 1+ acre with it.I didn't want the hassle, nasty smell and sound, danger, and cost of a gas mower. The only hassle with this guy is that it doesn't cut as uniformly as a gas mower. You may have to go over an area multiple times to get an even cut, and if don't your will get too long causing the guard on the front will bend the grass over without cutting it. If you cut it carefully you should have no issues.The mower still looks and works great after 6 years. The only thing that is showing wear is the foam handle. I will either have to replace or improvise something to keep it together within the next few years. I sharpened it for the first time last year (although maybe it should have been done earlier) after I realized it wasn't cutting as well as it should have. Sharpening is easy with the kit you can buy. That's been the only cost and maintenance needed since I bought the mower, which I love.
A1D6O5NRU8ZB4R	0	1	I have been working through Jethro Tull albums for a while now, starting at the oldest and working my way to the most recent. This album, unfortunately, stopped me in my tracks for a few years. I have only recently been able to skip over it and continue into their discography. It was really that bad.I know a lot of fans dislike A. And while I too found it to be a bit of a curveball, I grew to love it. Under Wraps I just could not bear to listen to. I tried once or twice, but ultimately, had to shelve it. The only redeeming aspect that earned it 2 stars was the track Under Wraps #2. It is a quite good track and has earned itself a spot in my Jethro Tull collection.
A1D6O5NRU8ZB4R	1	0	I bought this item with the intent of sprucing up a cheap mirror we had. To do so it needed to be cut down to size. I tried this inexpensive product, figuring I wouldn't be out much if it didn't work. I haven't cut glass before, but it worked well. I scored the glass side, not the silvered side. It snapped, leaving the mirrored side perfectly intact.
A1D6O5NRU8ZB4R	1	1	Being a fan of technological dystopian books, I picked this up cheap somewhere. It did not disappoint. It is refreshing to read a book that has as its main surprises the details of the daily lives of its characters.
A1D6VLPRKV6CMW	0	0	Casey Donovan might have won Australian Idol, but her debut single has failed to please the fans nor the charts.Selling only platinum status after nearly 1 month of sales made her the lowest selling winner or even runner-up. The reason is the song is a remake of a relatively unknown american singer Cece Winans, and the song is just not good enough to make an impressive impact.Sorry Casey. Hope you release something better next time round. In the meantime, strongly NOT RECOMMENDED.
A1D6VLPRKV6CMW	1	1	When Anthony Callea sang "The Prayer" on TV Hit Series Australian Idol, he surprised everyone in Australia with his amazing rendition of the Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli classic. Dicko (Judge) called it the best performance on the idol stage and Mark (Judge) gave it the Grand Royale Touchdown, an honour that nobody in the series have ever received.Anthony's outstanding performances throughout the competition earned him fleets of fans. His amazing talent reached out to millions of people, not only in Australia, but in many other countries have well. He has fans in US, UK, Germany, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore just to name a few."The Prayer" is now being released as a studio single, and produced by the musical director John Foreman. The 40 piece orchestra that accompanied Anthony's outstanding vocals thoroughly brought out the intensity and depth of the song. Anthony's powerful rendition of the song has started to take the world by storm. In Australia alone, The Prayer is No.1 on ARIA Sales Chart, having sold more than 200000 copies in merely 2 weeks, and already shipped 4X Platinum, a record that has even overtaken Guy Sebastian (Australian Idol 1 winner) and outsold the winner of this year, Casey Donovan by heaps and bounds. This further proves that you don't have to be a winner to succeed, likewise in the case of Clay Aiken, another stunning talent from "Idol".Anthony Callea's "The Prayer" is definitely a must-by for all music lovers, especially people who enjoy listening to Classical Pop. Anthony is set to take the world by storm, causing Global Callea Warming.
A1D6VLPRKV6CMW	1	1	I've seen the movie for 8 times, and it is still super.Intro/Credits:As i've ventured in the spoilers forum, so i know the credits were made similar to the donner films. But watching it on the big screen for the first time in my life is really amazing. I have goosebumps all over, especially with the familiar John Williams score. FANTASTIC.Plot/Story:I really love how Bryan paced the movie. There is definitely a balance between action and plot.The start of the film where we see Superman returning, and Martha having the talk to Clark was just amazing. I could really feel the emotions.The relationship between Superman, Lois and Richard were cleverly crafted. I really wished Richard is an a*s*shole so Superman and Lois can be together. This is however not so. Richard is a human Superman. He and Lois saved Superman! I liked how they make Richard reaching faster than Superman to save Lois first. It shows to us that Superman has too many responsibilities and lives to save. And Superman is not selfish, not only thinking of saving his love Lois. I'm looking forward to what happens between them in the sequels.We all know that the biggest twist in the film is that Superman has a kid. I had my doubts about this earlier on but Bryan and the writers have played it really well. It really worked. Jason comes across as really cute. The last scene with Superman talking to his son is amazing.Acting:~ Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark/Kal-ElFor a movie debut, Brandon is really impressive. He managed to separate the character into 3 different characters. I loved his Superman, adored his Clark and sympathise his Kal-El. Brandon as Superman is really powerful, solid, selfless and fearless. Although being hurt by kryptonite, he still uses his whole strength to save the world. This is official. Brandon is my Superman. I do not see any Christopher Reeve in Brandon's portrayal of Superman. As for Clark, I can swear that certain mannerisms and poses is really the exact spitting image of Chris' Clark. I adore Clark alot, clumsy and cute. If not for how he differentiates the 2 characters, audiences would've felt Clark Kent = Superman. But I could really see them as really different people. Excellent. As for Kal-El on farm which is the real Superman, you can see he really ain't that happy. He has huge responsibilities to fill, i actually sympathise with him as he has to sacrifice alot for the world.~ Kate Bosworth as Lois LaneThis is the first time I'm catching Kate's performance. Her Lois is entirely different from Margot's Lois. She may look young for a mother of 5, but she acts really well. And I loved how she didn't smoke in the film (and how Supes and Richard disallowing her to smoke) because one thing i didn't like was Margot's Lois smoking in the film. I had doubts about Kate initially but she won me over.~ Kevin Spacey as Lex LuthorNeedless to say, Kevin is perfect as Lex. I finally have my Lex. He's evil and selfish, and not campy.~ Sam Huntington as Jimmy OlsenSam is really funny as Jimmy. He definitely steals alot of the show away when he's on. I also liked how he is the only one who really adores Clark (the others doesn't really care much about Clark). Another good casting choice.~ OthersParker Posey did her part well, and i loved how she threw away the crystals, showing she is actually not a bad person. Not alot of Martha scenes, but the first ones with Clark was great.Visual Effects:Stunning visual effects indeed. After Superman saved the 777 jet, it tells us Superman is back. Someone sitting to the left of us clapped. I seldom see this happen. It was obvious he was stunned by the great visual effects and Superman's return. However, visual effects were not perfect in this movie. Still could see glitches. Some scenes were quite obvious that it's CGI. That's probably my only complaint of the film. But apart from that, the effects are really good.Soundtrack:John Ottman is a genious. He managed to use John Williams score and compiled into his own score as well. His score is magnificent and emotional. It really helps to create the visuals as well.Final thoughts:Superman has returned. I can't wait for more films. Though the film is not perfect, it is really really good. I loved and adored it. there are quite a number of homages to the donner films as well which is nice.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I very much enjoyed this movie. I am a thirty-something with no kids, but I very much enjoyed this animated western love story. It had something for everyone: suspense, action, romance, and of course, great music. I've always liked Bryan Adams and these songs were right on target with his style of music. The expressions these animals showed through their facial features and gestures were very humanistic and you could relate to what they were feeling. This has to be one of the better movies I have seen this year! And one of the few summer movies I have been anticipating seeing.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	This book was a real flashback to my adolescent/young adult years. I always considered myself quite an 80's buff (hence my e-mail address), but after taking these tests, I found my knowledge was sadly lacking in many areas that I loved and thought I knew so well. This is a great book for taking a trip down memory lane.
A1D74VX59A98EX	0	1	Thank goodness I chose Taylor's &quot;First Love, Wild Love&quot; as my introduction to the world of historical romance and not this book. If I chose this book, I wouldn't have read another romance. Actually, I wish I would have read this recently instead of 10 years ago, because I would have thrown the book down in disgust and not picked it up again. There are just too many books and too little time to spend on books like this one. But as a last comment, I do have to say, I have enjoyed Janelle Taylor's other historical novels, though.
A1D74VX59A98EX	0	0	I tried, I really tried to get into this book. After giving up on this book, I tried to give it another chance. I tried reading some more of it, but it just didn't work for me.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I bought this CD mainly for the hard-to-find song, &quot;Desert Moon&quot; by Dennis DeYoung. Another hard-to-find tune on here is &quot;Farewell My Summer Love&quot; by Michael Jackson, as well as &quot;Hello&quot; by Lionel Richie. There are many good songs to take you back to the good old days of the 80s. It is now one of my favorite albums (do we still call them albums???) and one I'll never part with.
A1D74VX59A98EX	0	1	I have to agree with some of the others, this book was far from Georgina Gentry's better works. Although I liked the heroine, Emma, I could not feel the same way for the hero, Rider. I found him obnoxious and down-right disgusting at times. I never felt like I was reading a real love story. Had this not been by one of my favorite authors, I would have not finished it. The secondary characters were also obnoxious and rude and I could not find anything to like about them. I have read almost all of Ms. Gentry's books and this one is at the bottom of the list. It definitely is NOT a keeper!
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I loved this mini series, I finally was able to track down the last 2 episodes. I love reading about southern life in the 1800's and this was wonderful portrayal of it. I loved the all-star cast and that several of the actors are now well known names. I believe this was the first major role for Patrick Swayze. Back when this originally was on tv, I was in high school and didn't watch it at the time. But I'm glad I waited until now. I feel that I have a better appreciation for the subject matter and many of the actors, than I would have at the time. I can't wait to see North and South, Book Two and will even read the final story in the trilogy, Heaven and Hell, although many say it is disappointing. I would love to see this as well as the sequels be shown again either on network or cable tv.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I love this album. It has so many great songs. I bought this as a cassette back in the 80's and would love to have it in a CD. I haven't been able to find &quot;With You I'm Born Again&quot; by Billy Preston and Syreeta on any other collection. The only other place I've seen Charlene's &quot;I've Never Been to Me&quot; is on Volume 2 of Ladies of the 80's. They are both super albums and very different in music. I'd recommend both of these albums.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I absolutely loved this book. At over 800 pages, I thought it would take forever. Well, it did in a way, I'm planning a wedding and couldn't reserve the time I use to to reading. But in the past month, I just couldn't put it down. This book is just such a sweeping saga, you can't help but get wrapped up in the characters lives. It begins in the 1860's and covers over 30 years. I loved the fact that the end is a journal entry 20 years later. This book is definitely a keeper. Hopefully, I can find another copy, because mine is so worn from so long going in and out of my purse.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	0	I give this book 4 stars, even though I found some of the descriptions just too much. Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka look like the ideal couple next door, but the reality is far from that. Paul is a sexual sadist and it can never really be actually proven if Karla herself is just as sick as her husband or if it's all a result of the horrible abuse and brainwashing she has endured over the years by him. Although you can't help feel sorry for the unbelievable treatment and horror Karla has endured, you can't help and wonder if early on when the relationship started getting weird or when he first hit her, had she stopped the relationship then, if all three young women's deaths may not have been saved, if not all three then at least her own sister, Tammy's and Karla herself would not have had to endure what she had, as well as being sent to prison. I was actually looking forward to this book ending, cause the cruelty and depravity Paul exhibited was just too much. All though, you can see how Paul's childhood and adolescence led to this, how Karla's upbringing resulted in what it did, makes one believe she really may have been a victim just as Tammy, Leslie, and Kristen were. All in all, this is a good true crime story, but very graphic and violent. A heavy dose of romance novels are now in store for me after reading "Deadly Innocence."
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	Another great book by Rosanne Bittner. It takes place several years before the Civil War, when there was fighting between the abolitionists and the pro-slavery factions in the border area of Kansas and Missouri. It's a great story of romance, vengeance, and survival during that violent time in our history. Blake Hastings is a man bent on avenging his father's death and Samantha Walters is a minster's daughter. What brings them together is their common belief in the abolitionist cause. What these two go through makes for a pageturner that you just can't put down.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I very much enjoyed this book. It was a very sweet Christian romance. It is part of a series of 3 other books and will look into getting these. It is rather heavy on the religious aspect so that may turn some off and there is no sex in this book, which I found refreshing for a change.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I actually bought the bundle of Bentz and Montoya books. But I don't care to read six 300- 400 page books all at one time. I wasn't sure about this at the beginning, although it started with a bang right away. I just never really cared about the main characters. But the storyline was exciting and it was hard to put down and when I did I couldn't wait to get back to it. I continuously changed my idea of who did it. Although the story comes to an ending, it also bridges itself to the next book in the series, Cold Blooded. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
A1D74VX59A98EX	1	1	I loved this book and rarely give a book 5 stars. Rarely have I enjoyed a Christmas romance. This one was such an enjoyable read. I will definitely read more by Lisa Mondello in the future. Although I think, she is a Christian author (she has been published by Steeple Chase which I think markets Christian books), there is no mention of God or any other Christian aspects of Christmas (not that I would have minded if it did), there are also no actual sex scenes. I find that refreshing and a rare combination. In my younger days, I loved a good bodice ripper, but it is nice to read something more low-keyed, but still quite sweet and romantic. This really gets you in the Christmas mood.
A1D7RE2VAEL4M	0	0	OK. I'm on my 3rd Maxtor now...if not for the 1yr replacement warranty I would have gotten something else...but each time, it starts with a clicking sounds and then rusty drive sounds, and then it stops appearing as a drive on my computer...each time I had to send back the damn thing, I've lost EVERYTHING up to 500GB of data (eg. music collection, photo collection, movies collection, etc...). The return policy is efficient but who cares for that when you've lost everything that is valuable on that drive??!!it has become a moot point for me to store data on it now, knowing that it's only a matter of time before I hear the clicking sounds...don't get ANY Maxtor. I've owned previously 2 300GB OneTouch III...with the same problem and I can only say that I had hold out that perhaps I was unlucky...but now it's beyond doubt. You've been warned.
A1D7RE2VAEL4M	0	1	I've owned both kindles so far, old and the latest. I have also bought a few e-books for the Kindle...but nothing prepared me for the discovery of the fact that Amazon CAN and HAS deleted books without permission from people's kindles!!! WTF??!! I'm putting mine up for sale now...Even Apple with its myriad of cutting-edge products have not tried (although their full capabilities are yet unknown) to do such a dastard deed as Amazon!!totally disappointed with this news...
A1D7RE2VAEL4M	0	0	I'm renovating my house and wanted to have a clean look on all my outlets...so I decided to go with this...the cost difference between this model and the typical two screws plate was exponential--$3.59 to $0.60...of course, I also saw the Lutron comparable model at $3.89...my thinking was hell it should be the same at this high price range...how so wrong I was...the Leviton was a flimsy piece of crap that easily frayed off the bottom screw area...leaving the top screw hold the entire plate...ie. bulging out the bottom and side...but since my contractor was installing them after I bought around 30 of them...and discovered afterwards the pathetic condition of them all...I truly regret the purchase and cost outlay...the Lutron had two screws to hold the plate and one clean snap-on cover that hides it all...a much better design than the Leviton flawed and poor design...save yourself the money and either go with the cheap one or the best and ONLY the best, Lutron model. BTW, the single-gang, double-gang, or triple-gang are of the same poor design!!!
A1D7TFKISP00H9	1	1	Pseudo-Intellectuals think &quot;On The Road&quot; is Kerouac's...you know, &quot;holy grail&quot; so to speak. Wrongo! Tristessa (am I pronouncing that right?) is Kerouac at his finest hour. I wanted to go out, get drunk and high, and then go to Mexico and stumble around in the gutter to see if I could re-enact some of the book. Guess what, it worked! A real boink for the old peepers!
A1D807T2HQSMWX	1	1	The problem I have with most workouts that are dances is that the dances tend to not be very good. If they look bad on the professionals doing them, or at least are not interesting, why would *you* want to do them? The obvious answer is that you won't. So, when I saw the moves for these set of DVDs, I had to have them. They are feminine, beautiful, and leave me feeling like I'm elegant and fit when I'm done. The only reason they don't get five stars from me is because the moves are a little tricky (as in, if you haven't done them before, just watching the DVD you won't be able to get them on the first try because it isn't clear what's happening). If you really want it, the moves aren't *hard*; there just isn't any instruction of what you should feel if you're doing it right. She just says, "Do &lt;such and such> move!" and you're like, "W-what?" And everyone else does them, but you're left going, "Wait, what does that move entail?" Not only that, but by the time you think you've figured it out in a slow pace, she's already moving on to doing it at full speed, so there isn't really a natural learning curve that most DVDs seem to have. If you're an awesome dancer and need something fast-paced or are willing to put in the effort to figure it out and match their skill, this is for you. It's definitely not for the weak-willed person who just wants the DVD to solve all their problems for them.So, I was disappointed by the lack of instruction and by the boring interviews (boring because they looked completely scripted and unnatural to me), but otherwise absolutely LOVE this DVD set and would recommend it to any of my friends in a heart-beat.
A1D807T2HQSMWX	0	1	I guess I'm kind of a stickler for feeding my kitties ONLY food that I know is good for them *all* the time. There are several things in this book that are recommended by vets NOT to feed to your cats, such as processed cheese (not including cottage cheese). However, there are some neat things in there too, and the book does say, "in moderation." But, if you're a stickler like me, you could probably do better with the Whole Food Diet book. It depends on what you're after. Personally, I feel weird about feeding my kitties something that's bad for them even if it's once a year, and most of the recipes in this book are like that. If you feel okay with that occasional treat and don't worry easily, then this book is awesome!
A1D807T2HQSMWX	0	0	I like a variety of animes, but this just isn't one of them. I couldn't even get past the first episode. First of all, I always watch in Japanese with subtitles, as I prefer original format, so I can't speak for the dubbed version, if there was one on there. I found the story to be convoluted, the artwork to be shabby in comparison to other loved animes, and the characters not at all compelling or people I could become attached to (a critical hook for me). I honestly didn't care if any or all of them died. But, I'm also not a horror fan (except Resident Evil), and don't like action scenes that are violent for the sake of violence without tasteful combat, which is all I could figure out that this anime offered. I prefer animes like Witch Hunter Robin, or Trigun, so perhaps this is a genre more reserved for people with different tastes than my own.
A1D807T2HQSMWX	1	1	I was really worried when I wanted to order these because so many reviews complained about how "shabby" they are. Now that I have them, and I've read a great deal of the corresponding book that goes with them, I can only figure out that those reviewers didn't understand the intention behind the flash cards.So, I will explain! First of all, I thought the flash cards came in better condition than I could have dreamed! They come in their own little box with a drawer (so cute!) and an ingenious way to keep them organized; each set of 100 cards is separated by a little marker so that you can start studying right away without mixing them *all* up. Also, the box set comes with extra cards that are blank so that if you go beyond the book, you have tools for teaching yourself. And no, not just a couple, but TONS of blank ones. I was like, "Wow, they really trust my dedication to study on! Great!"Second, the condition of the actual cards themselves has been really ridiculed on here. The cards are intentionally NOT laminated so that you can write helpful notes on them in pencil. If you understand the premise of the book from reading the introduction, you'll know that each person may come up with their own story for a kanji to recall it with, so if the story from the author doesn't work for you, this allows you to scribble something in. And, there's plenty of space for that!Another weird criticism I read about the cards is how you have to flip them in a weird direction . . . :} You have to flip it, there's no avoiding it. I find that you only have to flip it *once*, despite some people's moaning and groaning . . . Perhaps they don't understand flash cards, but it's also very nit-picky. If you're upset by something like this, perhaps you should not use flash cards. :}Now, on to the brilliance of the flash cards and why you shouldn't waste time making them yourself. I'm a very big DIY person, doing as much from scratch as possible (if I had the tools, I'd even make my soap at home), but the cards are so well-done that you'd be wasting your time. 1.) You won't get a pretty awesome box if you do it yourself unless you're a great box-maker. 2.) Since you're learning the kanji, you may make errors if you do it yourself, especially when you get to later kanji and realize that there's only a tiny difference between them. These cards are printed beautifully in typeset form. 3.) As mentioned before, the cards come with great separation tools so you can study one section at a time. 4.) The cost is excellent when you consider that you're getting 2040+ cards for $99. That's like a nickel a card. Could you buy this awesomeness for that much doing it yourself? 5.) The cards include Chinese compounds to show what they are like, corresponding to the Remembering the Kanji Book II. 6.) If you have Nelson's Japanese-English Character Dictionary, the corresponding number is on the card for your convenience. 7.) Information for the Japanese reading is on the card. 8.) The hiragana inflections of the kanji are on the cards. 9.) The number for the Remembering the Kanji I book are on the card. 10.) The Chinese pronunciation in katakana is on the card. 11.) The Japanese pronunciation in hiragana are on the card, set next to the English definitions. 12.) The keyword meaning from Remembering the Kanji I (most likely, the reason why you're getting the flash cards) is on the card. 13.) The pronunciation of the Chinese compounds (I'm not honestly sure what the difference is yet 'cause I haven't studied this far, but I'm sure at some point I'll be really happy these are there!) along with the English translations. 14.) The primitive elements of which the kanji is composed from Remembering the Kanji I. 15.) The cross-reference numbers for Remembering the Kanji II. And, finally, 16.) The number of the frame from O'Neill's Essential Kanji are also on the cards.This all means there's tons of information that you probably don't have, allowing you to cross-reference books for more information and study harder. You don't have to take apart the cards yourself (other than opening them up and putting them in the box with the little tabs separating them by each 100 characters), and again, the lack of lamination is so that you can write in notes in pencil if you need them, not because they were too lazy/cheap to it. In fact, it probably just would have made the set more expensive and less efficient for its purpose.My only criticism at all is that in the box, there are three rows, and the dividers do not go all the way to the end, so sometimes the flash cards that are on the end will slide into the wrong area if I shake up the box too much (carrying it in my backpack, so my own fault really). If you take good care of your box, this won't happen. Additionally, it's not a big deal if it does because the wandering cards will be right in front or right in back and it will be obvious where they should go because they are numbered.Good luck with your flash cards!
A1D807T2HQSMWX	1	1	I know this isn't necessarily the best product on the market, but it is the best for its price. Other reviewers have already given very specific details, but I am happy with the fact that I can link my own music in and play the Proteus sounds on top of them and vary the speeds and light effects to my choosing in addition to all of the programs that come with the system. The instructions are very clear and easy to use. If you enjoy things like hemi-sync or metamusic, then this is a must-have.
A1D807T2HQSMWX	1	1	I was a little worried when I saw this movie on Netflix. I thought that it might be cheesy or not very well-produced, but it's AMAZING. If you liked shows like &#34;The 10th Kingdom,&#34; then this is for you. Romantic, imaginative . . . this is a new holiday favorite for me. It's very long, but so great! I love the characters, the story, the music, the scenery . . . Great faerie tale, great costuming, great effects. I hadn't heard of it before, and I'm surprised. Really, snatch yourself up a copy before they're gone. &#60;3
A1D881T2KGSRUJ	1	1	I really like the features of this scale and find that it is a good scale for the price. Its good for up to 330 lbs, and measures to 1/5 of a lb. It has a nice sized platform, which accomodates my husbands size 13 feet just fine. I like that it stores info for multiple users and that I can enter a goal weight and track my progress. I can select which weight's I want to store, so on those days I feel like getting on the scale 20 times, I only have to keep the numbers I want or none at all!I didn't give it 5 stars though because it does have a few shortcomings. The display does not have a backlight, though I find that I can read it just fine once I move my gut out of the way and provided it hasn't blinked away yet. That is my only major complaint - the display goes off pretty quickly probably less than 15 seconds. If you do not click the button to save the weight, you'll have to re-weigh yourself and remember to watch it.I had a terrible analog style scale until buying this one, so my expectations weren't that high. Even still, I think this is a nice, accurate scale, and for the price it comes with enough bonus features to outweigh (ha!) the minor flaws.UPDATE 11/19/2009(!)This scale is working as well today as it was the day I bought it nearly four years ago. I can step on the scale mulitple times and get the same reading. I wish everything I purchased performed as well as this scale has.
A1D881T2KGSRUJ	1	1	We recently switched from an Evenflo Triumph to the Britax Regent. Our daughter is 33 months old, 33 lbs and just under 40" tall. She had reached the top limits of her old seat, but being less than 3 years old just isn't ready for a traditional booster. I shopped for several weeks before finally deciding to take the plunge with this seat. My hesitation was price and size.Ultimately price is easy to overcome, as what is more precious and worth more than the life of a child?As far as size goes, it is a large seat, no question about it. However, I drive a 2006 Honda Civic Sedan and don't really see how this seat is that much larger than the other seats I was seriously considering: the Evenflo Generations (hated the flimsy arm rests and adjustable head positioner), Graco Cargo (too narrow, not much room for a growing toddler), and the Recaro Young Sport (head wings were too big).This seat is installed in the backseat on the passenger side. It DOES indeed fit in my car and does NOT obstruct my view out the back window. In fact, the top of this seat is actually lower than the rear headrests are in their lowest position. It does take up the majority of one side of the backseat. We are only a three person family, so I do not have to consider space in my car for additional carseats. There is still plenty of space for one additional backseat passenger and the person riding in front of where the Britax is installed can still ride in relative comfort. I will take some pictures and post them for others to see.My daughter seems to really enjoy riding in this seat - I think her only complaint would be that it rides lower in the car and makes it a little harder for her to see out the side windows. As quickly as she is growing, I don't think that will be an issue for long. She often nods off in her seat and the side is just deep enough to allow her to do so without her head flopping all over the place. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend this seat to anyone who asked!
A1D881T2KGSRUJ	0	1	I had this on my Christmas list and was very specific that DH order this one BECAUSE of the included rechargable battery. Well, as with the other reviewer, there is no battery included. I haven't contacted Amazon YET, but I plan to. This is blatant false advertising - and I have been watching this item for MONTHS.It is a nice case though and I look forward to taking my printer on the go-go with it.
A1D881T2KGSRUJ	1	1	We received this platter as a Christmas gift a few years ago. While we only use it a few times a year, the presentation is always beautiful and it is always a conversation piece. The platter is very heavy and just feels like a high quality item. I fully expect that we'll be passing this one down to our daughter when she is old enough.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	This book is a very good guide. The thing I like most about it is its size. It is actaully smaller than "Birds of North America". It is a field guide not a desk reference like Howell and Webb "Birds of Mexico", that is about 3x larger or Hilty "Birds of Venezuela" 4x larger. These two books are actually too large to use as field guides. Many rip out the illustrations and bind them separately, because the books are too big to lug around. The only reason it did not receive 5 stars is because the range maps are in the back of the book. But "Birds of Costa Rica" does not even have range maps and it is considered excellent by many.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I spent 3 weeks in Costa Rica birding with this guide. There was only one bird in adult plumage that the illustration did not match the bird very well--peg billed finch. The finch is much much darker above than the illustration.The book has it limitations. No maps for one. Before I went I wrote beside each picture the places where it might be found of those that we planned to visit. That was a great help.We saw many juveniles that we had to carefully read the descriptions of the birds in order to assure ourselves that we had gotten them correct. There are very few illustration of juveniles.And the book is BIG.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	0	This is a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting stock and commodity charts. It covers the subject in detail from point and figure charts to candle stick charts.Every investor should own a copy of a book on Technical Analysis, if not this one, then a comparable volume.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	0	I bought this map for a trip to Ecuador. There are several things I do not like about it. 1. It is made out of plastic rather than that super strong paper like material that I thought it was made from. I fear that repeated folding and refolding is going to break the plastic. 2. natural features are not indexed--rivers. 3. no longitudes or latitudes are shown (this absolutely blew my mind. I had never heard up printing a map without these. Makes the map useless to use with a GPS.)What I do like. 1. nice scale 1: 1,000,000. 2. well printed 3. roads are well shown.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	The book explains the process of asset allocation in a clear and concise manner. There lots of examples and graphs that help the reader understand how asset allocation strategies can help improve his return and reduce his risk.I do recommend this book for investors and others interested in learning the techniques and strategies of asset allocation.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	0	After reading all kinds of reviews about how wonderful this book is, I had to read it. I could not get beyond the first 25 pages. Boring beyond belief. Maybe the story picks up, but I doubt it.During the 1st few pages it tells the story of this guy who buys a strong magnet from a Gypsy in an attempt to find gold with it. The magnet is so strong that it pulls the nails out of the walls of the houses and the houses collapse. See what I mean.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	Other than the fact that it can be a challenge to learn to use, this is outstanding. It actually might be better than outstanding if I could just figure out how to use all of the do dads that are in this software. What it can't do to a photo, probably does not need doing.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion. Suspense is outstanding. Story line is great. Acting is much better than average. And it has Grace Kelly. Most movies bore me to death--99.44% This is one of the very few that does not.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	0	I like Doris Day and I like Jimmy Stuart and I like Alfred Hitchcock. I do not like this movie. Boring, stupid, and trite. Buy Dial M for Murder instead. A infinitely better movie.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	0	I had read other reviews of this book that gave it high marks. I have no idea why. The book is nothing but generalities or suggestions the average investor can not use. For example, his point 10 in evaluating a company is: How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls? Then he goes on to say that the average investor has no idea. Brilliant! If you want to read a good book, get "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjemin Graham instead. Leave this one on the shelf.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I have used Lonely Planet Guides for all of my trips. They are invaluable. This particular guide has a few failings. One is the map of the underground and bus routes is way too small--almost unreadable. Another is that there is very little information about certain sections of London. It concentrates on the tourist attractions and neglects the areas of London where it would be nice to know of a decent restaurant or 2. The information on how to use the underground is lacking in detail, particularly on what ticket to buy and how much they cost. It covers the main points but there is little detail. It should say that the big problem with riding the London buses is knowing where to get off, but does not. It is easy to get on a bus, but knowing which stop is yours is a real trick. It should also say that the bus schedule is somewhat unreliable especially at night. The bus we wanted to take to Victoria Station at 1:00 am did not stop for us because it had on it a passed out passenger that had to be hauled to the hospital. Drunks have priority.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	0	This is a decent map although there is no insert for Lima nor Cuzco although there is sufficent blue to the west where an insert could have been provided. Very poor thought on their part. The map is made out of the very tough material that is extremely difficult to tear and latitudes and longitudes are provided. Don't laugh! I have had maps that did not provide these for some odd reason. Makes use of a GPS somewhat difficult. The rivers, mountain ranges and other geographic features are all marked but regrettably not indexed. The towns and national parks are indexed. Secondary roads are not shown. That is somewhat of a handicap. Jungle lodges are shown and named.Peru is a very large country, so there are a couple of tradeoffs. The country is shown half on the front and half on the back. The southern half is on one side and the northern on the other. The scale is 1:1,500,000. There is no milage (kilos actually) reference table between cities. You have to add up the kilometers along the way. A tiresome chore. Again that would have been exellent use of the vast blue space.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	The person I bought this gift for says that he thought it was great. One never knows how sincere such comments really are. But he is into tractors, so hopefully it was a sincere comment.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	1	This should perhaps be reviewed by those under 13. I bought this for my wife's nephew. My wife got a lot of pleasure reading the jokes. I myself thought they were too corny for my tastes.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I have been using Lonely Planet guides for all of my overseas trips. I would not think of traveling without one. The guide is shall I say more geared to the adventurer than the high end tourist. It does cover more expensive establishments but only as a part of the whole. I have not personally gone to Australia yet but I did spend a great deal of time planning the trip. Then fuel prices went throught the roof and then the stock market collapsed. Sort of put my trip on hold for a while. When I do go, this will be in my pack.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I spent 6 weeks birding Ecuador using this guide. It is mammoth. But it is also one of the best field guides I have used. The main complain is that the plates are separte from the descriptions. That does allow one to separate the two and carry just the plates. My birding buddy did that.One of the distinct pluses of this guide is it tells what species are similar to the observed species. The illustrations are well done though some are rather small, humming birds. The best way to carry it is to build a pouch that attaches to a belt. That way it is at your side ready to grab at a moment's notice. It is actually about the same size as Howell's Birds of Mexico or Hilty's Birds of Venezuela, two other tomes.My advice is if you do not want to lug around a large field guide, then don't plan on birding Ecuador, Columbia, Venezuela, Peru or Brazil.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I have read the other criticisms and they are valid. But when you compare this atlas to the competition, it has to receive 5 stars or the many of the others would not receive any stars. I used Goodes Atlas for years and hated every minute of it. It is so poorly done. The main problem you will have with this atlas is being able to pick it up. It is that large and that heavy.There are 125 plates. There is a graphical index (world map) to the map plates inside the front cover so with one quick glance at the index you can find the plate you are looking for. It even tells you the scale of the maps on the index. Most of the maps are at a reasonable scale, but unfortunately not all. For example Alaska is at 1:12,500,000 appended on to northern Canada and Greenland. Another criticism is that some of the feature names are very difficult to read, some rivers especially. They are printed in italics. The index indexes towns and also most geographical features. It does not index national parks though. The index is almost half the book.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	It took me a while to cozy up to this book. Some of it is totally off the wall. On page 81 for example it suggests a cruise through the northwest passage. Darn that sounds exciting. Where do I sign up? Searching the internet, I did find a cruise or two for 2009. Kind of expensive though $25,000+- for 25 days.Under the heading suggested big trips is included a trip to the space station at about 12.5 million. OK. If I start saving now, maybe in two hundred years I might be able to afford it discounting inflation.There is a whole page against drinking bottled water. I am 100% for that but does that actually belong in a travel book? Unless you have a taste for beer, many places bottled water is somewhat of a necessity to prevent diarea. Nothing worse than being laid up for 2 or 3 days on the toilet especially if you had a reservation on flight back home.But now for the good part. Discounting the off the wall stuff in the book, there is a lot of interesting information on places that the average tourist would never have even considered. Sierra Leone for example under the heading top 10 countries. There is not a lot of information provided on why this country is considered one of the top 10 other than a bottle of beer costs 85 cents. Maybe they have a point.The book is chocked full of interesting photos and information on a lot of places and things to consider doing that one would normally not encounter.In the back of the book there is a write up on each country of the world with a paragraph of why one might wish to visit that country. This section takes up about 50 pages of the book and in itself is a valuable resource.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I used this guide on a 6 week trip to Ecuador, and there were very few disappointments. The information on bus terminals in Quito could have been much better. It was misleading. We asked the cab driver where to get the bus to our destination. We traveled the entire breath of the country and that was the only failing worth mentioning. Hotel information was accurate.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	I used this guide on a birding trip to Uganda. This is an excellent guide. When you order the guide though be sure to order the soft back edition rather than the hard back if you are going to use it as a field guide. The hard back weighs more and if you happen to drop it the back is liable to rip off. If you do order the hard back be sure to reinforce the binding with shipping tape. Unlike some guides this one has a well though out index. The common names are indexed separately from the scientific names. The family name are in bold so they stand out and the font is a large size for we old time birders who have a difficult time reading small print. In the back is a map of the area with all the important bird sites noted and listed. Certain of the drawings are not accurate, the Mountain Greenbul being a prime example. The description says the underparts are yellow and they are in Uganda, but the drawing is not. The descriptions and range maps are opposite the drawings of the birds. This is the 2nd copy of this guide I have owned. I gave the first copy to my Uganda driver when he asked if I would sell it to him. Folks in Uganda have a difficult time getting birding equipment. If you do go there, take a couple of extra laser pointers, and an extra birding guide with you if you have room. They make great gratuity items if you do not wish to sell them instead. Also an extra pair of inexpensive binoculars.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	0	1	This is not up to being a quality guide. The maps are not on the pages with the birds and the maps are so small that for birds in limited distribution, one can not even find them on the map at all. The bird illustrations are very small. Finally, you most likely if you are over 40 to need a magnifying glass to find the bird in the index. My final complaint is that the colors used to separate breeding resident (sort of a blue-green) from winter visitor (dark blue) are so close that just looking at the map you can not tell if it is a winter visitor or a summer resident. Woops, I thought of another complaint. The index to common names is before the index to scientific names. When one is trying frantically to get to the index of common names to check on the id of a bird in the field, it should be contained in the last few pages of the book and not 6 pages before the scientific names. The book also does not have a quick index to bird families as does almost every well thought out bird guide published today.Now of the good part. It is compact.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	This is actually a selection of short stories about one character. You might say each chapter is a stand alone chapter. I think I might have read every book written by Harold Lamb. I have never been disappointed.The story is about an old Cossack warrior who has a set of adventures across the steppes and on into China and down into the middle east. A thriller.
A1D8XAMJ1W3Q5Q	1	1	This guide is great for giving you a sense of what Rome is like. It is not as detailed description wise as Lonely Planet, but the old saying "a picture is worth a 1000 words" applies here and this guide is loaded with pictures--every page.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	For those not familiar with the Cooks Illustrated books, they are a bit different from most cookbooks. Each dish is approached in a very thorough and rigorous way; different ingredients, amounts, cooking methods, etc. are all examined to determine the tastiest and most convenient recipe. Each recipe goes into detail on how to best prepare the dish, and many recipes offer variations to allow you to customize the dish to your particular taste. After having tried perhaps 20 recipes in this book, I can honestly say that they have all been very good to excellent. One of the most difficult parts about cooking a new dish is deciding which recipe to use- a quick search on the internet might reveal 100 recipes for, say, risotto. The editors of this book have already done the work for you combing through the recipes to find the best one. Highly recommended.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	My wife and I love our 2 shorthair cats (1 siamese, 1 tonkinese), but hate the hair that gets everywhere. I was a bit skeptical when trying this, as I've tried virtually every type of brush out there, including several similar rubber brushes. I don't know if it is the specific type of rubber used or the shape of the "bristles", but this thing is crazy effective. I just could NOT BELIEVE how much hair it takes out, and the cats enjoy being brushed with it. I do agree with some reviewers that the hair doesn't all stay on the brush- some will end up on your clothes and flying around in the air while you're brushing. However, if you brush the cat in the garage or somewhere else where the flying fur won't matter, you're all set. Fantastic!

A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	I finally got tired of the cheap, inaccurate pencil gages that you get at local stores. Purchased this is spite of some reviews complaining about accuracy and durability. Can't really address long term durability yet, but the gage does appear to be of good quality- looks sturdy. Also the manufacturer does warn against damaging the bourdon tube pressure assembly if the gage is dropped; it looks rugged enough to withstand regular use. I tested the pressure readout on this against a lab-grade magnehelic gage, and the pressure readings were spot on. The pressure release valve is a nice feature, and works well. Have ordered two more for my other vehicles.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	I purchased these for my wife to look through on a camping trip to Yellowstone and the Tetons. Decided it was time to get a nice pair of binoculars, rather than using the cheap ones I've had since I was a kid. When my wife took them out to use, the zoom wouldn't work. Sliding the lever around did nothing. Don't know what happened to the zoom, but the binoculars were not dropped, mishandled, or anything, and the box wasn't damaged in shipment. Returned to Amazon for a new pair, and they work fine, hopefully the zoom will continue to work. Optically very good, does require some care to keep a steady view at full magnification, but definitely usable. Also, it does include a tripod mount, which is a bonus.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	This is a great hitch which normally should install easily and quickly. As with others, I didn't need to move the exhaust to install.However, MAKE SURE YOUR THREADS ARE CLEAN before installing the hitch. I installed this on a 3-year old Odyssey, and the threads on the bolt holes were pretty well corroded and gunked up. Tried cleaning them with solvent, penetrating oil, compressed air, and a stiff brush. Nothing worked well enough, and as a result, most of the bolts didn't go in very cleanly. I was in a rush to get this done, and wound up with several crossed threads and even a bolt head which snapped off. What I should have done was run a M12-1.25 tap through the bolt holes to make sure they were clean and ready to accept the bolts. After my first installation, I removed the hitch and did just that- the reinstallation was effortless. Just make sure those threads are clean the first time, and you'll be OK.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	This little machine is a godsend for dicing vegetables. I've used it to chop up onions and peppers, and to finely mince garlic. I always hate dicing up veggies, it is such a chore. I have both full sized and mini food processors, but the full sized food processor takes too long to clean, and the mini processor doesn't do such a great job. This chopper disassembles and cleans up very easily, and it is very simple to use. Note that to get effective chopping, you shouldn't overload it. Chop smaller quantities, and it is faster and more effective.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	0	1	This software is not compatible with Windows 7- it installs, but will not run. Supposedly works with Windows XP, but definitely not with Win 7.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	0	1	Tried installing this on a new laptop with Windows 7, the installation program said that it was not compatible and stopped the install.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	0	0	I find it annoying and ironic that a book about a group of book editors is digitized so sloppily. Apparently, the publisher is too lazy/greedy to pay someone to read through the book to fix the numerous typographical errors. Really unprofessional; shame on you, Houghton Mifflin.As for the story itself, I loved it.
A1D90P78GKW5O3	1	1	After trying a number of different methods (shims, clams, etc.) to stop hitch rattle, I am very happy with this device. It took less than a minute to install, and it is very effective in nearly eliminating rattle. It also appears to be very solidly built.
A1D9217PNJUFVS	1	1	In this period of Elian Gonzalez saturation, I was very pleased to learn of the book by S.L. Price. I was in graduate school at the time of the Bay of Pigs. I visited Cuba in 1979 for a period of 10 days. I have been an avid reader about the developments on the Island, before and after Castro. I cannot imagine anyone, however one feels about Castro or the Cuban revolution, not finding a mother lode of delightful information, commentary, annecdotes, etc., in Price's book. If one happens to be a sports fan, as I am, the book is doubly rewarding; to read of the tidbits about people like Canseco (who played in my hometown), Ordonez, Stevenson, et.al. Plus, the book gives the reader the context and texture of Cuba since Castro: its sights, its sounds, its people, and the extraordinary complexity of the issues involved in evaluating the success or failure of the revolution, or in assigning blame or fault for what has gone right, and for what has gone wrong. If I have a fault with Price's conclusion, it is in the nonjudgmental tone of the Postcript, where he says, &quot;for me, the game is over. Castro's country is a place&quot; as the cliche is about New York, to be visited, but no place to live. After all Price has seen heard and observed, and after his prodigious research, one would have expected him to say something more trenchant. I would at a minimum have expected him to wonder, however wistfully, what might the Cuban revolution have accomplished but for the implacable hostitlity of the United States. But alas, in the end, I suppose we are all patriots, though writers like Price seem to not understand that citizens of Cuba can also be patriots, however wierd that may appear to an American.
A1D9217PNJUFVS	1	1	I am unfortunately not as familiar with Roth's earlier works and previous reviewers, though I have read him, knew of him, and respected him as one of America's great writers. I was nonetheless excited to discover this motherlode of observation, perception and wisdom that deigns touch upon such complicated and socially sensitive matters as race, academic culture, contemporary social pyrotechnics, vietnam, and simply surviving the murk of daily living. As an African American, it was a very pleasant surprise to discover the implicit wisdom of Roth's dissection of what it must be like, or entail, to cross the color line. Roth explores the subject matter with a wisdom and sensitivity and, more importantly, and insigtfulness that is rather staggering. Should I add, for an outsider? But perhaps that is the implicit lesson of the book; that though we may be positioned as outsiders in viewing arcane matters dealing with other races, cultures and societal segments, we may not be at all--that the human stain that brushes against all of us, gives us insight into the plight, the problems, and the possiblilities of the rest of us. Roth's novel is excellent, entertaining and rewarding reading.
A1D9217PNJUFVS	0	0	Like Dunne and so many others of us unfortunates, I spent an inexcusable amount of time on the O.J.Simpson triall. I knew of Dunne's involvement because of his outsized presence in the courtroom, and his many television appearances. I would never have bothered to read his book because of his unabashed bias for the prosecution; but when it showed up at my bookstore for a more than reasonable price--less than a Snicker Bar by a multiple of 5, I succumbed.I actually enjoyed the book, and hope other readers will. However, that pleasure is accompanied by a serious lament. You see, I happen to be an American of African descent. I have in my living room a large painting of two blacks, one male and one female, hanging from a tree: the pictorial Billy Holiday memorialized in the song, &quot;Strange Fruit.&quot; Dunne confesses, though confess he did not mean, in the book, this his and his colleagues' attitudes about Simpson's guilt had resulted in a &quot;white riot.&quot; And indeed it did!Yet Dunne, who professed his belief in Simpson's guilt from the first moment he heard of the tragic deaths of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, at no time ever entertained the thought that perhaps his belief was not well founded. In fact, his book is a constant repetition of this knowledge, without a scant acknowledgement that in the world in which serious and moral people live, it is rare that reality is that uncomplicated. And whatever one believes, an objective observer would have to conclude that the Simpsons and Goldmans live in a very complicated environment. I enjoyed Dunne's book for the same reason that some reviewers dissed it: his inveterate name dropping. But in conclusion, I assume that is who he is...which is sad, but not my problem What I regret, even as I understand his pain at the loss of his daughter by a thug who was inadequately punished, is that he lives his life with this blithe, perverse since of what justice generally, and criminal justice, specifically, are about. He used his book to ape ever fundamental racist attitude and notion I have ever heard in America--the stupidity of the jurors; his faith in juror #3, the white one; the presumptive criminality of blacks--if there is a racist canard in America, Dunne mouthed it at one time or another, lamentably, perhaps, unintentionally. Many people of my kind and color became &quot;strange fruit&quot; because of the presumptiveness of guilt--the alleged &quot;mountain of evidence&quot; that prosecutors like those in the Simpson trial promised, but when put to the test, could not deliver. White does not make right--always...Mr. Dunne might learn. Had he spent less time at dinner parties, and more time reading so of the 50 or so books written about the trial, perhaps he could have resisted the allure of the &quot;mob.&quot; But he knows &quot;OJ did it,&quot; and because he is white, and presumptively right, case closed. My advise: enjoy the book for what it is; despise it for what it isn't.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	1	1	I am a fan of the Timex Ironman series because they have the "countdown repeat" function, which is perfect for doing laps in pools - it chimes off every minute (or whatever you program) to keep you on a consistent pace. But I recommend getting one with a cloth strap rather than the rigid-ish plastic one here; I've had both and find the former much more comfortable.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	1	1	I recommend this publication because the stories are very good (although I had to keep a notepad beside me with Nostromo to keep track of the characters) and the quality of the printing and binding is top-notch. With re-printed books the paper/printing is too often rubbish (beware esp. Simon & Schuster), but this is a nice job.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	0	1	The story is terrific, classic Conrad. The printing is rubbish though (I am referring to the version published by S&P; with the sandy shore on the cover). The font size is miniscule - almost impossible to read - while the book's title is printed in an enormous font at the top of every page. It looks like a PDF gone wrong.Get the book, but from a decent publisher. There is no way I'm buying another S&P; product.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	1	1	I am not actually a Peter Sellers fan - but I was curious about him because of his impact. I found the book somewhat interesting, but not riveting. I am sure fans will get a lot out of it but for casual readers like myself I wouldn't put it at the top of the must-read list.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	1	1	The machine worked great first time out of the box. Feels sturdy and quick to set up/dismantle. Just need to work on the recipe though - the straight eggs and flour mix was surprisingly bland.
A1D97U0US5G7MA	1	1	Works well - bottle of red in fridge still fine after 4 days, mind you I'm not expert. Nice system where it clicks to tell you when you have achieved vacuum. Nothing not to love.
A1D990EJK9MMNV	1	1	Despite hopelessly dated references and slang, this Wodehouse classic is simply hilarious. A very entertaining read. When you are not laughing out loud, you are giggling. Each page has some new profoundly believable absurdity.If you want to lose yourself in a quick farce, there is nothing better than Wodehouse. I found this effort to be even more entertaining than the Wooster and Jeeves stories.
A1D990EJK9MMNV	1	1	Complicated story. Dozens of characters. Very detailed, plausible universe.Good read.Just a little too long and the ending was a little random.
A1D99KEPDG8ZUF	0	0	I managed to mix about 10 pitchers of Kool-Aid before the mixing mechanism broke. I feel like an idiot because I did read the reviews that warned about the fragility of the mixer, but I thought I'll just be gentle... didn't work. Buy the 2 Qt. Rubbermaid Servin Saver White Mixing Pitcher. Simple, nothing to break, just a better pitcher. Don't buy this pitcher, it sucks.
A1D99KEPDG8ZUF	1	1	I enjoy the feel of quality with this faucet. Valve has a smooth action, faucet head swivels easily but not too easily. Feels much more substantial than the faucet this one is replacing. Good finish. Installed without a hitch.
A1D9DFU85CPK4E	1	1	This is just a lovely album. Its been one of my favorites for years, and still just as moving as the first time I heard it. Esp "Je Serai La", a beautiful & poignant love letter from a mother to her child.
A1D9DFU85CPK4E	1	1	Fantastic. Cooked the chicken under a brick and bread salad recently (used a grown chicken instead of 4 babies). Fabulous! Pretty simple recipes, authentic and just delicious.
A1D9DFU85CPK4E	0	0	Don't waste your money. Bought my first one in June, and when I placed it on the faucet it clearly didn't fit right, and leaked from around the point of contact. So I returned it for another. Which did the same thing, but I both figured I'd just have to live with a little leak, and also couldn't be bothered to make another 20 mile roundtrip to the store. Since June I've gone through two filters. This second filter is fairly new, yet suddenly I noticed that the output was getting weaker and weaker...and the leak was getting worse and worse. Finally no water, other than a drip, made it out of the filter, as the water just pours out of other points on the contraption. Yes, I have taken it off, put it back on, tried to figure out the problem. The problem is that it is very poorly made, bad design, and just junk. Yes it is easy to snap onto the faucet, but at the cost of a tight fit.
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	0	1	Would love to review this item, much waited for but STILL NOT ARRIVED !!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure why some freight takes so long from this site !
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	0	0	Up until now many reviews on this site have been o.k as such, but I bought this DVD based upon the reviews and what waste of money ! The production is poor, the plans of action poor. For example who would travel half way round the world to explore something in no mans land and go out in the blue yonder without topping up the gas tank. They had this " almost " out of gas stunt a few times over and showing you the team boarding a small turbo prop aircraft to travel from the USA to a Pacific Island ! Leave it out, what a load of toffee. I figure the reviews came from the cast and crew. This just cannot be considered even amateur let alone serious. Oh and boys, if you want to catch something on film in the jungle, shut up !
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	1	1	Didn't expect too much but this DVD / Series, although a great image platform for Steven, is worth watching. It's entertaining, fun, well done and not OTT.
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	0	0	Must say I have watched this show for the " entertainment " value more than anything, but with the latest release totally over it. I am not sure how dedicated the " team " is to helping people, if they are at all. It seems they love certain phrases and for people that do this sort of thing they seem VERY alarmed if they think they find something. Notice how the show is more and more of them blurting out and NOT of any real event or pick up, notice how they " see " shadows but the camera's never catch a thing, notice how there are hot spots and they seldom watch these area's, notice how short the " dead " times actually are, notice how they always do things in the dark for effect when many cases reported have daytime sightings etc.. It may also be my feeling of disappointment but in this last series there are more and more mirrors, more and more shots of Ryan looking at himself in them, surely he has earnt enough money by now to buy his own mirror or is he just vain ????? Maybe the director is possessed by mirror's or his mother was attacked by one but something is strange here and it's not the filmed vision presented which is after all, why one would buy this ! Maybe the most Paranormal thing is why we all still buy this stuff when ...................
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	1	1	Fantastic show. Great down to earth presentation, well documented and some great insight and footage. The interviews are well done and the production really tops.
A1D9ICDD6D5ISO	1	1	It was well worth the money and wait to get this episode. Like always a great show, well put together but there were a few editing / out of sequence shots noted. However that is by the side, the contents, the show and the cooking excellent. Bit too many four letter words though for my liking, maybe if Chefs want to impress by lack of language skills they should be edited out of the show.
A1DA5B7A6618R0	1	1	This book is no different from any of Lindy Smith's other books. She has brillant ideas and easy to follow instrustions. A must for all cake decorators.
A1DA5B7A6618R0	0	0	The recipes seem simple enough but as you are reading through them, you realize that the instructions does not mention some of the ingredients listed. Also, the coconut shortbread recipe is missing the quantity of butter required.I also thought the book was a bit overpriced.
A1DA5B7A6618R0	1	1	Another well done book by Debbie Brown. A must for your collection if you are an avid cake decorator.
A1DANQVK2XS51T	1	1	This game is just what I was hoping it would be. A great way to pass the time in the car, or to use as a conversation starter during down times. I have 2 kids ages 8 & 5 and they love the game as much as the adults do! There is a board game involved with little chips, but we never even use them. We all enjoy just talking about the questions and making up our own. Great game!
A1DANQVK2XS51T	1	1	I love this thermometer! It is very easy and quick to use (although it may take some practicing to learn how to do it right) and as someone else mentioned, you don't have to buy those plastic head covers like you do with the ear thermometers. I used it for a week and then noticed at an appointment that it is the same thermometer that my pediatrician uses! I am very happy with it.
A1DANQVK2XS51T	1	1	I have 3 kids and they have all loved this book. They think it is so much fun to "feed" each of the little animals. There is a little box on the inside cover to hold the food when you're not reading it, and it drops into another little box when each animal is fed. Very cute, fun book.
A1DANQVK2XS51T	1	1	My daughter got this for her 9th birthday because she wanted to learn how to knit. It is a great starter set, with LOTS of yarn, long wooden needles & a cute carrying basket. My only complaint is that even after reading the instructions several times, neither of us understood or could get it to work. We may have to look somewhere else for more simple instructions. We've had the set for almost 6 months, and so far, nothing has been knitted!
A1DANQVK2XS51T	0	0	I bought this product and used it with no problems for 8 months to play my iPod in my car. Then it started having problems. It started making sounds like the tape was switching sides, but would do it several times in one song. That problem lasted about a month, then it stopped working completely. Less than a year later, I'm shopping for a new cassette adapter.

A1DB1ZQ2IVGT8P	1	1	I bought these blades back in 2009, and literally just replaced them.Silicone blades last a lot longer than rubber - the quality is worth a few extra bucks. Highly recommended.

A1DB351WVDZFBF	1	1	When I first got a whiff of Kouros, it was a total olfactory assault. I wondered who in the hootenanny would want to smell like a urinal puck?The test strip sat around, and I kept coming back to smell it, and as I did, it really grew on me. It doesn't smell like a urinal puck at all! If it does, then whatever! All I know is that it smells good and clean, like a gas station bathroom should, and I get nothing but compliments when I wear it. The sillage is strong, so a little bit will carry over a wide radius. It also lasts for a long time.There is a dual nature to the scent: on one hand it smells like clean laundry; on the other hand, it smells dirty, musky, and manly -- especially the bottom notes. This is definitely not a unisex fragrance. It's very unique, and definitely one of my top 3 colognes, if not my #1.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	0	0	Like Cool Water, this is one of those colognes that girls seem to like, but I can never understand why. I was disappointed to find that it smells like every third or fourth guido at a club, while the others are wearing Cool Water, Aqua Di Gio, or Axe. Although I didn't wear it around anybody else, I found the sillage to be strong, offensive, and I couldn't wash it off for the life of me. It also seemed to smell very synthetic, and more like an aquatic than a citrus aromatic. I couldn't detect the citrus, the cinnamon, and in fact, I didn't detect any change through the different notes at all. Perhaps it's just my body chemistry that it doesn't agree with, as I typically wear woody floral musks, or woody spicy colognes like 212 for Men, Burberry Touch, Amouage Reflection Man, or Terre D'Hermes.It has it's audience. I would personally classify this as a cologne for the guy in baggy pants, a track jacket, and a hat turned sideways who drives a supped-up Honda -- and that guy should wear it during the fall or winter. Personally, I plan to return my bottle or use it as a paperweight.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	1	1	Like most modern colognes, Terre D'Hermes opens with strong citrus top notes, but these notes are accompanied with a smoked wood aroma. It's like peeling oranges or lemons while standing around a bonfire. After about 30 minutes, it dries down to a very pleasant earthy, woody aroma, with a hint of patchouli, and there is little trace of the smoky, citrus opening. The fragrance lasts all day but is never too overpowering. Even when I no longer smell it on myself, I get compliments from others near by. It has definitely become one of my favorite colognes, if not my favorite.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	0	0	9 was one of the worst movies I've paid money to see on the big screen, and I'm glad I only devoted 80 minutes to it. Even so, it took every bit of will power I had in me to not walk out of the theater.Granted, I didn't hate it... it didn't offend me, although I felt gypped. The animation is not as mind-blowing as people have said. At least, no more mind-blowing than anything Pixar has put out.The biggest problem with 9 is the writing. Most of the lines in the film are cliche to the extent of being hilariously bad -- just as laughable as the cliche little personalities of the characters 1 through 9. I was literally laughing out loud when I think I should have been... I dunno... moved? Crying? Hiding my tears in order to seem tough?You have one character that repeats the same cryptic line, "Go back to the source! Go back to the source," like some kind of jerk. And that's JUST the thing with this movie -- without giving too much away about the plot or how the movie ends -- the characters are very one-dimensional. They each have their own way of responding to things, and they never develop, change, or progress throughout the movie. I feel as though the writer is trying too hard to emphasize each character's uniqueness, and it becomes overkill after not-too-long. Only at the conclusion of the movie does it become apparent why the writer wrote for each of the characters in this way. Until then, the movie is frustrating to watch. I think it would have been less frustrating if the "big reveal" at the end was part of the plot all along. At least then I could empathize with the characters instead of becoming irritated.Some people (either on IMDB or here on Amazon -- I don't remember) said that the viewer just needed to think about what was being said, etc. That's fine & dandy, but really, this is one movie that I just didn't find to be very profound. There is no gap in my understanding of the plot, believe you, me. I just think it could have been written much better.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	1	1	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just a hilarious movie. I've watched this movie several times, and each time I watch it, there is something new and funny that I notice.CWACOM is about an aspiring inventor, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), and his attempts to live up to the legacies of the greatest inventors in history. Flint is a grown-up child whose eccentric behavior is only bested by his enthusiasm to create the greatest invention mankind has ever known.So far, his inventions have only been notorious for ending in disaster -- either personally (the spray-on shoes he applied in class, only to find out they would not come off), or for the entire town (the ratbirds that escaped and bred at an alarming rate).His pursuit of this legacy is stymied by Earl Deveraux (Mr. T), a local cop who has his eye on Flint, and is half-superhero; and his Father, Tim (James Caan), a Sardine Bait & Tackle shop owner who is losing faith in his son's ability to invent anything meaningful, and wants him to work in the tackle shop. Tim is a very strong character, one of the funniest, and he does it without trying (he delivers some of the funniest "lines" in the movie without uttering a word.)For his latest invention, Flint is working on the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator," or FLDSMDFR for short (pronounced FLI-dis-m'duh-fur). Once the FLDSMDFR works, water will go in the top, and the food of your choice will come out at the bottom. Flint just needs a little more power, and the town will no longer be stuck eating the sardines that the world recently declared to be "super gross."Cloudy does not have a single dull moment. If you blink, you might miss one of the most hilarous parts of the movie, but there are so many of those instances that it's hard to say when that would be. It's chock-full of sight gags, wacky sound effects, stupidly great jokes & puns, and Flint Lockwood's nerdy attempts to impress weathergirl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) with his intelligence, humor, or his claim to have an allergy in common with her.The animation can only be described as Ren & Stimpy meets Warner Brothers, meets Muppets. You also have the hilarious Looney Tunes-esque sound effects, intentionally "lame" humor, ironic use of disaster movie cliche's (weather anchor Patrick (Al Roker) even observes that the storm is "following an unusual pattern of hitting all of the worlds major landmarks first, and then spreading across the rest of the globe,") and an awesome soundtrack by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh to give it the 80's retro-futuristic tone. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's purely entertaining from start to finish.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	0	0	When I purchased this movie, I had it in mind to watch it with my 3-year-old son, which I did. My son liked it ok, but I was put off by it. The coldness of the characters (especially the human characters) brings a whole new meaning to the term "uncanny valley," which traditionally means something intended to look like a human, but falls short in such a way that looks creepy. In this case, it applies to the emotional aspects of the characters, rather than the physical.(The following paragraphs contain SPOILERS for early scenes in the movie).You never really get to know Toby before he dies, so it's easy to emotionally detach yourself from his death. My son was not so disturbed by it as he is too young to understand much of the plot. Despite the cold, detached way the movie portrayed these scenes, I was disturbed. Not because of the death of Toby, mind you. I was disturbed as a father whose greatest fears are portrayed in this movie in a way I can't empathize with. It made me feel uncomfortable to be so detached. Add to that the fact that the writer/director chickens out on Toby's death and makes him just disappear, literally in a flash of light, so that it takes a few moments to understand that he died. Toby's father, Dr. Tenma (a very blah Nicholas Cage) doesn't react to Toby's death in a way that makes the death (let alone his reaction to it) seem believable. All you get from him is, "Where's my son? Where's Toby," spoken in a tone that reminds me of Willy Wonka's, "Don't. Stop. Come back." Then he forces himself to whimper over Toby's hat. There is no funeral; no semblance of actual grieving before Dr. Tenma is seen creating a robotic replacement some days later.After a couple of short scenes with Dr. Tenma and Astro Boy at home (not spending much time with eachother, though), and with no further character development, Dr. Tenma rejects Astro Boy for not being like Toby. His explanation being that something is different about him -- he's not Toby.What the heck?! They seemed the same to me! There was no way to know what was so different about Astro Boy that he could just throw him out like that. He was the same kid! Sure, he was modified with rockets for feet and machine guns that stick out of his butt so that he can escape death, but otherwise, Astro Boy seemed just as human and boy-like as Toby or any other boy in this celluloid universe. These characters have no soul.In the original comic book, Dr. Tenma was more harsh toward Astro Boy and chased him away with a shovel. I think I would have preferred that, because then you at least have some semblance of REAL EMOTION. When compared to coldly telling him "I don't want you," the comic book showed Dr. Tenma as a human who is suffering from his failed attempt to cope.In the movie, the characters merely react to their emotions, but do not express them in a way that makes their actions seem genuine.If you ask me what was good about this movie, it's the fact that my son loved the robots, the Astro Boy character, and I can't say he was distressed about any of the events in the movie. Ham Egg (Nathan Lane) was one of two characters that I felt had substance. He reminded me a bit of Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars. The other character of substance was Dr. Elefun, who seemed to be the only person with any real emotion or conscience, but no guts. There are also a couple of impressive scenes that exhibit the environment, as well as Astro Boy's powers, but other than that, the movie was just a dud.
A1DB351WVDZFBF	0	1	The show is great ; perhaps the best ever produced. Unfortunately, as so many others have said, some of the discs won't play. There is no visible defect, and no way to know if you will be so unlucky as to get a set with defective discs. Even the ones that load, they too will sometimes crap out in the middle of an episode, regardless of what DVD player I use. I have made many fruitless efforts to find a remedy, but it seems like I am stuck with these rather expensive ersatz, plastic mirrors. I am furious! This was not a cheap investment, and it pains me to have to give this show less than the five stars it deserves!
A1DB351WVDZFBF	1	1	The sixteen episodes on this disk are as great as you would expect from Adventure Time. It is not a complete season, nor does it claim to be. They're still 16 awesome episodes no matter how you slice it.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	1	1	This is one of the best romances that I have read, and believe me, I have read a lot and ALMOST HEAVEN definately created its mark in my collection. The summary at the back of the book does not do this book much credit at all. It is so much more than a predictable romance with a beautiful heroine and handsome hero. Despite the shallow summary, I had to get this book because I believed Ms. McNaught would deliver.And deliver she did! Although the storyline may seem like a churn out of the romance mill, but this one is definately NOT. A brilliant storyline with characters you actually feel you get to know and feel for. Their disputes are certainly within appropriate reasons and great fun to read. Elizabeth's character is a joy to read about: lots of inner strength, independant with an unorthodox childhood that makes her who she is. Also, I loved that for once at the end, it is the heroine that is not willing to give into, or propose a divorce between her and her husband. It just showed how much faith she had in him, and his love for her, if even at that time he was too enraged to realize it. The connection between her and Ian is written in a way that you actually feel they know each other very well and that the attraction springs from that charm other than first appearances, although the handsome hero and beautiful heroine fluff didn't hurt.Ms. McNaught certainly outdid herself with this book. It's an amazing piece of work. If you want a touching story with lots of emotion and an unforgettable ending, then do yourself a favour and purchase this book.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	0	1	The main flaw of this book is that it doesn't centre around the personalities two main characters! There isn't much introduction to them and throughout the story, you don't feel as if you get to know them or care about them at all. Christian and Brianna are either baiting each other with words or tearing each others clothes off. There is a lot of graphic sex scenes in this book that I felt isn't necessary for a 'romance'. And what is it with the erotic dreams?There wasn't enough focus on the two main characters. Christian was absolutely sure that Brianna was his destiny the moment he laid eyes on her, because of his erotic dreams he was having of her, before he even met her. Shallow in the most extreme, and not very realistic. It was likewise for Brianna, therefore scrapping out the ritual 'dance' that most male-female characters do in romance novels, the courtship, and the teasing or arguments that comes before the couple fall in love; there were none of that.However, there is one plus point to the book and that is the small romance between Prince Edward and Joan of Kent. This secondary romance was very sweet to read and unlike Christian and Brianna, you can actually feel the love between these two. You ache for them, but not for the actual lead characters.This was my second VH book and will be my last. If I had wanted erotica, I would have just bought one. Putting erotica under romance just doesn't work in big doses for me. Pass this book over, you won't miss a thing.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	1	1	I thouroughly enjoyed this book from front to back, it took me from start to finish in one read. A natural page-turner.This book is fast-paced, not lagging during scenarios or lacking in wit. The heroine, Victoria or Tory for short, is a rare delight to read about and it is very amusing to read her attempts to 'seduce' her husband, whilst being very innocent about the whole thing. This being because of years of witnessing her parents loveless, but happy marriage, she assumes that Jason will want to do the things that they had, such as play chess and read together. Her arguments with Jason are aplenty in this book, and range from being very hurtful, to simply teasing and humourous. A big plus to the story, it was very sweet and funny to read about. That said, the reformation of Jason was very moving.The downside is, there isn't much focus on Jason himself. His past is extremely heart-wrenching, and it definately did soften my attitute towards him, not to mention that it did sadly justify his actions and words towards Victoria. The other thing that made me rate this book with a 4 star instead of 5, is that of the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending is very touching and fitting as well, but it was too short compared to all the bumps in the road Victoria had to get over to get there.I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance with characters you actually feel for. It's a wonderful, easy-breezy read that you can't help but enjoy and delight in.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	1	1	This book is very sweet. I'm not sure where the 'liar' came from unless you think that holding things back from someone, is considered lying.Anyhow, this book is actually a great read. While I wouldn't actually say it's fast-paced, since it did get kind of winding half-way through; especially when Sam repeatedly pushes Mike away from her despite him being such an exceptionally sweet guy to her. Well, the reasons for those are revealed and they did satisfy me, but I felt that Ms. Deveraux took too long to get there. Mike is a dream as the heroine of the story, no tempers, no alpha-male arrogance or indifference. I seem to be using this word a lot for this book, but its fitting: sweet. Mike Taggart is very, very sweet towards Samantha. And that's something I always enjoy to read in a romance novel. How she treats him, is another matter and at the end is justified, so I can't grumble too much about that.One thing that bugged me was the ending. One thing in the book: Sam's gone through so much crap in her life that she cannot bring herself to cry anymore. I was waiting for a touching, moving ending that when she would, it would be a big part of the story. I was a bit dissapointed when it was short and rushed but not too displeased by it to be turned off the whole book. And the revelation of her grandmother's life was written poorly and it wasn't of much intrest in the book itself. It just seemed like a common interest to bring Mike and Sam closer, by way of more interaction if they had a base for it.Overall, this book was one of Deveraux's better books. Not by any means another one of her average 'nice' one or her very memorable ones, but somewhere up there. The storyline was just OK, but the interaction between characters and dialogue was delightful to read. Sweet, and infinately romantic throughout.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	1	1	I was a little bit sceptical when buying this book since I wasn't such a great fan of either Raistlin or Caramon, but I did want to read the continuation of Dragonlance so I did, and I wasn't dissapointed by half even. The start of the story drew me in almost instantly and I was immediately captivated and intruiged by the new main character, Crysania. She is the perfect counterpart to Raistlin. She complements his personality and has the role to stimulate Raisltin's character development and overall, she really made him a more interesting person to read about.The storyline itself is marvellous. IMHO, it surpasses the previous trillogy (Chronicles) in terms of character development, dialogue and most noticeably, the plot. The only weakness in this book (which earned it a 4 star instead of 5) is that between a fast-paced start and a cliff-hanging but exciting ending, it also has along with an excruciatingly SLOW middle. I really had to force myself to go on then. But, was worth the pain since after the plot quickened all the things I sludged through to read became part of a bigger , clearer picture. Worth the patience. I would definately recommend this book. It's definately worth the time spent reading it.
A1DB4HZ94PYCJC	1	1	THE BLIND MIRROR is definately worth a read. It starts out a little bit slow, and the beginning is very similar to other Pike books (mainly his teen novels): boyhood friends meet up after so and so time has gone by, followed by a brief walkthrough of their lives together.But after the slow start, where you're wondering where exactly the story is going; it suddenly gets very, very intriguing and will have you sucked in right up until the end of the book. This books also gave me the creeps. There is a sense of urgency, disorientation, confusion and fear that you can actually catch on to. The dialogue flows naturally, there is a good balance between words and thoughts while two characters are speaking to each other. Enough to stir up the atmosphere.The author does an excellent job of connecting readers with his characters. This book is a very natural page turner and is a pretty easy read for a horror/ mystery sort of genre.However, the only dissapointment had to be the ending. It spiraled down breathtakingly fast and had me thouroughly engaged, but it ends with an abrupt stop. It doesn't even provoke any thoughtful discussion on it. And you wonder, was the whole beat around the bush plot really necessary for it to end that way, which seemed inevitable whatever the lead character did about it.I can't hate the book however disappointing the ending was. I still thought that THE BLIND MIRROR had an amazing way of engaging the reader. You really want to know what's going to happen, what everything is really all about. Pick it up, you'll love reading this book. Just not the ending.
A1DB7N78RGLV5L	1	1	Yes, I am an idiot, but I am the type of idiot who can admit a mistake.This was the first dive watch I ever bought (a gift for the girlfriend, an avid diver) and I had never heard of a screw-down crown before. It's a watch, right? You pull the stupid thing out to set the time, you push the stupid thing back in when you're done. Turns out the stupid thing was the one doing the pushing and pulling.The crown didn't come out when I pulled, so I used a tool. It didn't go back in when I pushed, so I used a tool. Naturally it never felt right after that. After a while the entire shaft connected to the crown pulled out. The watch still ran, but after a couple more dives water got in and the thing stopped working. So I posted a 2-star review here and sent the watch back to Citizen with an angry letter.Eventually the girlfriend became the wife, and I became a diver too (a stipulation of the marriage). This year for Christmas she bought me a gorgeous dive watch. The crown didn't come out when I pulled, but this time I read the instructions. "Screw-down crown"? Oh *eff* me...Did I mention that I am an idiot?Despite the flagrant user error and being outside of the one-year warranty, Citizen repaired the watch, good as new, at no charge. I now know that Citizen is a company that you can trust for both quality and customer service.The watch itself is perfect. Perfect size and perfect look. It's a style in and of itself. I bought my wife another Citizen, a gorgeous dress bracelet with a mother-of-pearl face. Few are the days when one or the other isn't on her wrist. Now I'm starting to lust after a Citizen chronograph for myself...***Edited to give this watch the 5 stars it deserves. When I first edited to admit my mistake I could not change the stars. Thanks for not hating me too much.***
A1DB7N78RGLV5L	1	1	One day the Logitech Mx510 will be hailed as the greatest mouse of all time. I bought mine at Comp USA in 2004 when it was first released. It has been with me through a Dell desktop and two MacBooks. The scroll wheel gave out around 3am last night. I picked up a new Logitech this morning and I know that one day I will grow to love it just as much, but tonight when I get home I know that it will hurt to have to unplug my steadfast Mx510. I don't think that I will be able to bring myself to throw it away. Perhaps I will donate it to a library or church. Maybe there is a charity for donating home electronics to schools in developing countries. If anyone knows of such an organization, please leave a comment.Mx510, my friend, go now with God, and rest in peace. You will be missed, but you will be remembered.Yours,-tim
A1DB7N78RGLV5L	1	1	I picked one of these up on Amazon for $25. It has a great shape and they keys have nice, snappy action. It is far superior to the Microsoft Naturals, especially if you have larger than average hands.
A1DB7N78RGLV5L	1	1	You know how it is when you subscribe to a magazine and you have to click past a notice that says "You will begin receiving your periodical in six to eight weeks."? Not Concrete Wave. I subscribed last week and lo and behold this miserable rainy Monday afternoon I return home to find the latest issue (the issue that made me want to subscribe) waiting for me when I got home -- hand addressed, no less. They even included a 2011 calendar with longboarding girls on the cover (swoon!). Thanks, CW!If your wheels are 60mm or bigger, you need this magazine.
A1DBCHREMYNOVT	1	1	Received the sticks yesterday! They look and feel fabulous. I can't wait for my little one to get to drumming on Christmas.
A1DBCHREMYNOVT	1	1	Thank you so much to Austin Bazaar. The drum set looked wonderful and was received on time however, the crash cymbal was dented. I spoke to an Amazon customer rep and they gave me the number to Austin Bazaar. I left them a message and they promptly returned my call. They are shipping me a replacement cymbal immediately and told me to call back if I had any other questions. It made me feel wonderful about this fairly large Christmas present purchase. The drum set looks perfect otherwise. Our 2 1/2 year old is going to love it. I anticipate it will be a "hit"!***UPDATE*** The drum set is a hit with both my 2 1/2 year old and also his 6 year old sister. My brother is a professional percussionist and he was impressed with the quality of this junior drum set. I had another professional drummer assemble the set for us. He thought the set was great. It took him (a professional who has assembled MANY sets) between 30-40 mins. This included him professionally tuning the heads for us. If we had been left to do all of this ourselves it would have taken MUCH longer so be sure to set aside plenty of time for assembly. It is a beautiful set! Love the red metallic!
A1DBCHREMYNOVT	0	0	WOW, what a load of mess this is claiming to be for KIDS 9+. The directions are absolutely terrible. There are no numbers on the actual pieces so you have to mull over 5 different diagrams filled with teeny tiny numbers to find the pieces you need. They cheaped out massively on the instructions, not even explaining the correct positions certain pieces need to be in. It ends up being trial and error and if you are not mechanically inclined, like myself (a 33 year old WITH a college degree), it becomes a project of stress. A couple of the pieces split apart when I was trying to put them in. I was not rough with them. They are just very thin pieces. Before I felt like steam was going to come out of my ears I stopped the project and tossed it in the trash. My daughter was unable to do ANY part of this project on her own. I am going to research some other sets that seem more truly age appropriate and have been rated higher on quality. This is a terrible kit for a child. It's a terrible kit for an adult. I am so tired of buying products that look great but end up being cheap pieces of junk with inadequate instructions.
A1DBEISSI2AOKD	1	1	This is one of the first workout video's I've ever bought so I can't really compare them to many. But I do know that I love this! It is so easy just to pop in and workout for 10 minutes and feel good after! I found her very easy to follow and she isn't annoying to listen to. I've not gotten the time to put each segment together for a better workout but I know I will be happy. The main reason I bought it was for the 10 minutes of workout for my busy life.
A1DBEISSI2AOKD	1	1	It's always nice to read a first person point of view romance since I have found that they are rare. And for them to be enjoyable and sometimes funny is even more rare to me. Gena Showalter is really a writer that causes me to read like crazy! I just can't seem to get enough. I read this book in about 3 days. This is a keeper.
A1DBEISSI2AOKD	1	1	This is the first lens I have purchased for my Canon that was not the Canon brand and I have found it very good for the price! It has a very good zoom for the price I paid and it worked very well taking pictures at the Grand Canyon. The only con's I've found with this lens it that switching between the Telephoto and Macro positions can be frustrating. I sometimes need to switch to manual focus just to retract the lens to put it away. A small hindrance but it doesn't ruin my excitement!
A1DBHXOSIX94KV	1	1	Well, if he likes, give him this Video and extimulate him to try it out drawing !!! It's a great video and can definitivelly help him enter in this fantastic world.
A1DBHXOSIX94KV	1	1	Go to any lan-house in the world and you will see people from all ages playing Counter-strike or other first-person shooters. Well, this book tells the story of the people that created this concept and impulsionate the 3D graphics video boards market. But it's not an kind of "biography", this book is really well written, making you read just too see what will happens next. I also recoment this book to every father who thinks his son is wasting too much time in computers. Also, I highly recomend this book to every young that is considering build a career in Computer Science. You will understand how hard work and opportunity can change your life.
A1DBHXOSIX94KV	1	1	This is the 3rd book I got about the subject and I can say that this one in my favourite. Is short but covers everything very well. Also, the authors really show a lot of experience and very good writing skills. A really hope they write and intermediate book covering more stuff and using a RPG Toolkit like NWN2 one. You can't go wrong with this book. GRAB IT !
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	0	1	terrible, i hate this cd, they are all a bunch of Kurt wannabes screaming the lines of nirvana songs, they ruined every song on this album, the only reason any one should buy this is if you intend to burn it!
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	1	1	This movie has got to be my #1 favorite concert movie! Excellent songs along with excellent footage. I love nirvana, i think that they made the most interesting songs, i got the cd neveremind about two or three years, and my cd didnt have Endless,Nameless on it, but this did, so now do i not only know how it goes but i also got to see them smash their guitars. If you like nirvana, even the least little bit, get this, PLEASE GET THIS
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	1	1	nirvana kicked things off w/ an excellent first album, a must have
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	0	0	I am a hudge Nirvana fan but, where do people get off making stupid accusations when they have no real evidance to back up their stories????? The movie started off ok but then it came, the meaningless interviews, they had no real value except that they knew kurt and that they think that it was a murder, key word think! They even had scenes that were nothing but space-taker-upers, here are two for example, there are a million car scenes that all they do is film the road no talking no music, just the road and other cars, now the only thing that that accomplished was getting me dissy, anothere scene is where they go in to a building and they are told to leave, why did they keep that in? to stretch it out!!!!!!! To top it all off they showed a really grose scene from a music video that has alot of nude people in it, and they curse every other word! and why do they do this? to give it that R rating, so that Teenagers will be drawn to that becaus it is rated R. and to fill in some time spots they talk about their funds for making the documentary, and how they dont have much more money to spend! Of course I had to find this movie at blockbuster and had to get it, well that was time and money down the tubes, spare youself the agony, dont touch this film.

A1DBK6EMTZ979S	0	0	1)make really (...) music!2) act like losers!3) mix it w/ rap (...)4) stir it for 5 secondsand then you get the ultimate junk band in the world.and i call this home made dish &quot;SUM 41&quot;
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	1	1	since my other review of this album was so short and plain i decided to write another one analizing the entire CD, this time i hope you like it!1) Smells Like Teen Spirit: A+ this song is the most well known songby Nirvana and is very well written and has great musical skill put into it. Great way to start off their cd.2) In Bloom: A this song is a great Nirvana song in general. It has a great solo, like all of their work, and has pretty good lyrics. Yet again another good song.3) Come As You Are: B+ ok, i try to look at everything from different points of view. This song has excellent vocal power but the actual music is a little plain. On the 3rd day of guitar lessons i could play the entire thing through.4) Breed: B- this song can get a little on your nerves if youre not in th right mood5) Lithium: A+++ Best song on theentire album!6) Polly: B A ittle too morbid but still solid all the way through7) Territorial Pissings: A funny and vividly describes the way Cobain want thingso be and how things were in his life.8) Dain You: A great lyrics and very unique solo.9) Lounge Act: A Cobains mutters the F word in this song! a rarity for nirvana!10) Stay Away: B- the song was very good but the thing that brought it down was one of the last lines when Cobain says something Negative about God, however, i like to thik f it as Cobain calling God happy11) On A Plane: A+ nice song with good lyrics and a very happy sense in it, another rarity for Nirvana12) Something In The Way: A very mellow slow song that describes Cobains life &quot;Underneath the bridge&quot;13) Endless,nameless: A+++++ anpther favorite on this album. this is the hidden 13th track on the (selected) album(s). i do believe that nirvana was 1 of the first bands to feature a hidden track on their albums. very verygood track with ear spliting heavy feedback! if you buy the album for any reason do it for the hope of getting this song on it!Very good album a must have for any self respected music fan!
A1DBK6EMTZ979S	1	1	great CD! GET THIS CD I LOVE IT U WILL 2! the only good &quot;Rap Metal&quot; band out there!
A1DC9FHK52M2LC	1	0	An objective study guide to questions often asked about the Roman Catholic Church from those outside the church. It is a help in understanding what the Church truly teaches about its signs, sacraments, symbols and saints. It does not have a sectarian ax to grind, and leaves the reader with a choice to make after discovering the evidence presented. Its content may lead the reader to deeper investigation into the Catholic faith.
A1DC9FHK52M2LC	1	1	This study edition is an eye opener to those who are sincerely seeking an explanation of the meaning of the Holy Eucharist from a historic, Apostolic and Orthodox-Catholic perspective, back to our Jews roots as Christians. For the fist time many readers will discover the "Jewish Jesus", who celebrates the Jewish Passover with His twelve disciples, and from that celebration evolves our Christian Eucharist. Truly timeless, valuable information.
A1DC9FHK52M2LC	1	1	I first saw this movie on the Turner Classics on T.V. It provoked my deep interest in African-American history. It is the true story of an African-American family who crossed the "color line", and passed for "white" in an northern state. I purchased the DVD and have viewed it with select groups for discussion and dialogue. The material is very thought challenging .It is well worth the price. I recommend it!
A1DCA6GCPAFXY9	0	1	I believe that this movie will strike a chord with teenagers and people who believe that vulgarity equals humor. Since there is no real plot and the attempts at laughter fall flat for the most part, I found myself fast forwarding most of the movie. The best part of the movie is actually in the DVD extras which gives a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie. Other than that, it's just a bad movie, period.
A1DCA6GCPAFXY9	1	1	There are very few films that become instant cult classics such as Godard's 1960 Breathless and the less-than-brilliant Pulp Fiction by Tarantino. Run Lola Run in many aspects tops both these movies in its ability to take an incredibly simple plot and turn it into an exgtravaganza of motion, sound and film-making showmanship that redefines filmography and becomes a genre of its own.Run Lola Run is a brilliant combination of a very talented cast, extremely creative writing and masterful video and sound editing, which results in one of the greatest masterpieces in modern moviemaking history. I am not getting carried away!Although the movie is sparse with words, it does an incredible job at providing a unique perspective into the characters lives, sometimes with a single sentence or even just a sequence of camera snapshots:Lola's mother's only sentence in the movie while holding a glass of wine, talking on the phone from home: "clearly, I knew your ascendant was Sagittarius.... But you are married too".Lola's relationship with her father:Lola: "if I can't get the money, Manni will die".Father: "Who is Manni?"Lola: "My boyfriend for a year now".We also get a glimpse into random characters' lives through a sequence of camera snapshots, sometimes in a humorous way, all interweaving into the main theme which is the stage and play that we're all part of and how sequences of events change the outcome of the end of the play.Along the plot line there are several humorous winks and tributes to other movies and books which arguably provided some inspiration to parts of the movie. For instance, Lola's ability to shatter glass with her voice is a direct tribute to German author Gunter Grass's The Tin Drum. A silent scene at the casino provides a tribute to Apocalypse Now. The 3 tries plot may have been inspired by Fritz Lang's 1922 Der Mude Tod, etc.Regardless if you recognize these tributes, Run Lola Run is a captivating movie where every frame and every note of sound seem to be perfectly orchestrated by a maestro who is conducting this fast paced, brilliant symphony.Film making at its best! Savor it!
A1DCA6GCPAFXY9	0	0	I checked out Amazon reviews just to see if anyone was going to give this sham of a movie 5 stars. As expected, some people did. Apparently there is a market for every piece of garbage that Hollywood produces.This is a movie that Jim Carrey will want to forget quickly. It's almost sad watching one of Hollywood's most talented comedians turn into a pale shadow of his former self, trying to force some laughs out of this miserable script. The plot is obviously an attempt to replicate Liar Liar along the same lines but whereas Liar Liar was clever and funny, Yes Man is dumb and unfunny. Watching Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel read those trite script lines is almost painful.
A1DCA6GCPAFXY9	1	1	This is a brilliant collection of essays by Israel Adam Shamir, an Israeli journalist and ex-paratrooper. It has the same power of Dances With Wolves to change an entire generation's perception of the Israel/Palestine conflict and shed light on the machinations of Israeli apartheid. This is why Zionists and their apologists were quick to label Shamir an antisemite (he is a former Jew) and wield the ultimate weapon of excommunication - "Holocaust denier" (although many of his family perished in the Holocaust).Shamir does not mince words. He describes the Zionist enterprise in Palestine for what it is: a brutal project of ethnic cleansing of the native Palestinians, supported by many misinformed people throughout the West. He laments the Zionist transformation of the Holy Land from a land of olive trees and the people who tend to them, into a giant military base with barbed wire and walls and steel machines imported from the US to raze villages and confine the natives of the land in ghettos. Palestine, which for centuries embodied the spirit of religious coexistence and is central to Christianity, Islam and Judaism, is now a nuclear volcano at the hands of a supremacist state, ready to erupt and rain destruction on the entire region and beyond.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the forces that are shaping today's world, as Mr. Shamir makes clear: the struggle for Palestine goes far beyond the land itself. Whether you are a layman who was told that it is "a fight between Jews and Muslims for land" or an erudite who believes that a Palestinian "state" (as the definition of "state" varies widely) is the prized elixir, this book is bound to enlighten and inform and reshape your opinion on what is happening in the Holy Land.I highly recommend.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	1	1	If you have neither room nor can justify for the collectors edition box see the standalone blu ray has everything you need a wonderful sharp well presented transfer of the 1942 Classic and hours upon hours of extras from a Looney Tunes short (which does fall flat as it was done years after Mel Blanc had passed) to everything shown alongside Casablanca (news reels shorts ect) Documentaries, deleted scenes and more.Obviously the film is a classic and there is nothing I can say about that hasn't already been said in the 70 years since this film was made. I myself only just saw it for the first time and a second time just a few hours prior to writing this review.If you are on the fence about getting this film on blu ray, don't be pick it up you won't regret doing so.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	0	1	"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" Gal 6:7I open this review with scripture. Why you ask? WELL EVERY Christian movie ever made is a mockery of God. When Christians make a movie they never think of how to entertain they just try to drill the message in. The Point of Christian films should be toencourage people to live as Christ did. Not Judge others, accept people for who they are while not ignoring their sinful nature.Christian movies seldom give this message and it's made worse by drilling home personal opinions of the ministry behind these movies. Courageous is a fine example of this. The message of this film "BE A MAN BY FORCING CHRIST ON TO YOUR KIDS" This message is delivered through a melodramatic poorly edited sermon near the end of the film. It's less a Christian Sermon and looks more like when Hitler gave his speeches in Nazi Germany.Christians, some the mildness sheep with blind faith, Will love this others will see this as what it is. A Poor attempt to make a GOOD Christian movie.We have separation of Church and state...we also apparently have a separation of Church and entertainment.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	0	1	Whose idea was it to use white subtitles on a show that is mostly bright colors? Funimation that's who. My Eyesight is pretty bad but even if I Could see these white subtitles would be impossible to read. I've complained to funimation about this before but I guess my complaints have fallen on deaf ears.Everyone else in the world uses Yellow subtitles. Why not funimation? WHY NOT?You're better off with fansubs.That said the Blu ray transfer is a good one and the show it self is good from what I can gather. But the subtitles make this show almost unwatchable and I refuse to watch dubbed.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	0	0	Initially I thought this was a great movie and gave it 4/5 stars however as I looked though things to bring for trade credit at Movie Stop Harry Brown was the first Blu Ray to go in the pile.The good about this movie, it's is well shot and well acted Michael Caine acts his role as well as he always has. The Visual style reminded me of Oldboy. Also, Chavs get killed the violence is quite satisfyingThe Bad, Plot twists although they are hinted at at the begining of the film they are almost given away as a twist near the end of the movie as cop out to add balance between Caine and the British punks so as not to have him totally dominate the little brats.On one hand it's a satisfying movie but on the other the unnessessary plot twists, Bizarre pacing and unnecessary last minute plot twists hold this movie back.At best this is a rental at worst you're better off watching Michael Caine in something else.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	0	1	The Zietgiest movies are more a cult recruiting tool than anything that "we as a people must see" These "Films" and I use that term Loosely are full of factual errors anybody with even minimal education can debunk. The Opinions offered give no real insight into society and rely mostly on fear mongering and Conspiracy theory. Anybody with half a brain should steer clear of this trash.
A1DCC0WL0SYB1S	0	0	There are countless factual errors that you don't even need a degree in Egyptian mythology to find. There are hundreds of Debunkings of this film online. What this film is, is the first in a series of fear mongering propaganda that preys on the paranoid and weak minded. Anybody with half a brain would know within Minutes that this films assumptions are wrong even if they sit though the whole thing the lack of Citations or any real sources for the material presented is sheer proof the "Film maker" which is a loose term as this garbage was probably made on a 10 year old video editor, made every last thing in this "movie" up. Steer clear and if anybody says you need to see this have them committed only the criminally insane will get anything out of this trash.
A1DCSJ2J7EJL08	1	1	I've owned mine for over 2 years now, and it works great. It's a wonderful deal for the price.However, when no sound signal is present, a clearly audible hum can be heard from the subwoofer. This ambient noise will probably throw off a lot of audiophiles, even I can't stand having it on without anything playing.
A1DCSJ2J7EJL08	0	0	I've been using this product for years, and have liked it a lot actually. However, I recently purchased a bottle and found it defective. Normally, this hair product is like a gooey paste or glue (as the name implies). The bottle I had came out with a clear liquid, epoxy-like slime mixed with the glue. It's gross, unmanageable, and unusable as a hair product.After contacting Got2B through their website, describing the above... they responded 5 days later with an automated email saying I did not "provide enough information" and should call their phone support. Pardon me? After all, I went out of my way to inform them of a product defect. I sent them another email saying this is unacceptable and would return the defect. product to my retailer, and switch to another brand (I've had good experience with that ICE stuff)
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	1	1	What I liked the most about this book is that it did not take the stance against any religion. I'm sure most would be expecting this to be a Mormon-bashing session or Christian-bashing session depending on which side of religion the author is on. However, religion was never the focus of why this person did what they did and I commend Mr. Olsen on that. It would have been so easy to do that with this situation.This book was one of the best real crime books I have read. It kept my attention and I couldn't put it down. I love to read about all kinds of events in history that I had no idea about and this was an eye-opening one for me. Superbly written and displayed in events.
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	1	1	Wow, what an AWESOME experience to read this book. I couldn't stop reading, and then I would go back and read some parts again and again. This has to be the BEST book Mr. Lucado has written.I read this book while a friend was dying. It couldn't have been a better time to pick this book up and read. It gave me so much joy and hope for my friend that it didn't hurt so much to watch her go. It didn't take away the missing feelings, but it satisfied my urge of wanting to keep her here.I cannot wait to meet Jesus! It will be an awesome and joyful time for all of us. Thank you Mr. Lucado and God Bless!
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	0	0	Bill Maher's knowledge of the Bible is absolutely laughable. But who he goes to to answer his questions in the movie is even more laughable. Come on, Bill. Can't you do better than truckers to get your theological questions answered? I'm not a theology major, but I could answer the questions better than most of the people he interviewed. Except in the instance of Ken Ham. That was just creative editing.This film will appeal to anybody who is weak in their faith or doesn't believe at all, so in that case it isn't a true documentary at all. To be a documentary you have to state facts and since Bill doesn't even know the facts himself....well, ya know.
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	1	1	I just finished reading this for the first time. I'm so happy I did. It's a great read, albeit a long read but worth the time spent.
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	0	0	I hate this book. There is absolutely no point. It is so monotonous and tedious I'm about to pull my hair out. Luckily, I only have about 40 more pages to go. If I wasn't so OCD about finishing books, I would've chucked this one a looooong time ago. I seriously don't get what all the hype is about with this book. Just because it was controversial (ie. language, loose sexual references) in 1945?!?! I pity any child that had to read this in school, thank goodness I didn't or I would've flunked. We read real literature like "Where the Red Fern Grows," "Of Mice and Men, " "To Kill a Mockingbird," etc. I'm appreciating my English teacher's judgement . Booooooo to this book!!!!
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	1	1	This book is just wonderful. I'm 36 and just read it for the first time. I remember seeing it in the library growing up but never read it. I'm glad I waited. I don't think I could've grasped the language of the bood I read it as a child. It is a very sweet book that isn't just for children.
A1DCUGN2EGW7ZB	1	1	I thought this book was fantastic. I loved Little Women, but it was super long and took a long time to read. This book is so much faster and was so sweet. I'm starting the sequel, Rose in Bloom, now. Also, check out Under the Lilacs by Ms. Alcott because that is a great book also.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	It was all right, but the series seems to be going down. I hope Sweet Revenge is better.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book was so-so, no big thriller. It seemed in-complete to me. I think she forgot to fill in a couple of the blanks. I won't go any further, read it for yourself but wait for the paperback. This book was very disappointing, not well thought out and half done.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book was boring, the dialog was lackluster and the protagonist could not have been more weak and useless. This book was terrible.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	1	This books was excellent until the end. I think the ending could have been better. This could be a series.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	1	I did not enjoy this book as much as the others in the series. There was tooooooooooo much of the two reporters, their romance, their following the women in the sisterhoold, etc. they were annoying and not essential to the book and I hope they are not in the next book. I much preferred Mark from the previous book.The book was about Isabelle's revenge but she was hardly in the book, nor for that matter was the sisterhood, though I must say the character of Rosemary was the best villian in the whole series.I hope the next book is better with more of the sisterhood and their methods of revenge (and bring back the character of Mark and x-out the reports).
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book was terrible. Let's start with the lead character Andie. If she wasn't whining about being mixed (Native American/White) she was being weak, silly and chasing after her boss, mind you she was getting married in the beginning of the book. The romance had no place in this book, it just took up extra space. You know a book is bad when the best character is the 6 year old. And the ending was ridiculous, I was angry I wasted by money.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book was terrible. The writing was childish. This book would have been better if written with teenagers instead of adults. The story went round and round, and the situations she found herself in were ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book or this author's childish writing style to anyone.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book was extremely disappointing. I was wondering how much weaker could Paul get. His wife has an affair, he cries like a baby, he goes home and acts as though nothings has happened. When they finally discuss the affair its like a discussion from the dwilight zone, it made no sense whatsoever and in the end it was never dealt with (which he should have kicked her out of the house since she was with her lover just before he was murdered, but she was ending it, another large hole in the story which, no surprise was never dealt with). Another big irritation was Paul with his constant self-analyzing, he is the flatest protagonist I've ever read about. This book was just ridiculous. Anscombe is definitely no Stephen White. He was all over the place and he never really dealt with any of the issues that started the book, I won't even mention the ending, I mean how many times can you say ridiculous.I see this is going to be a series so I would suggest a lot less self analyzing by Paul, give Paul a backbone, more dialog and more realistic writing.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This was one of the worst books I've ever read. There was not one character who was not irritating. Dave was a whiny wimp, Lisa was a pain in the neck, Susan was an idiot, Lupe and Bruno ridiculous. There was basically no dialog in the book. The constant self-examination by each character was over-the-top. If this is this author's idea of good writing I don't see her with a long career. You need a lot more dialog and less self analysis. Like a prior reviewer, I forced myself to read through this book. A total disappointment. And the constant e-mails to Lisa from Susan were weird.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	1	I liked the book though a bit too descriptive. I would like to see a follow-up with Lauren, I found her to be the more likeable character. Hopefully this author will be writing it in the near future, I will keep a check on her book listings. Lauren was a complicated character who was extremely suppressed emotionally and the book, if written, would be a good one.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	1	I thought this book was great. I won't go into the story because most of the reviewers have already done so. I will say its a page turner and in my opinion a must buy.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	He lived in filth, he smelled terrible, he slept around and had a whole lot of kids he didn't care about not to even mention he couldn't remember her name. Also, the story of the Lady and the castle was never resolved, she just left it and never bothered to do anything with it. This was one sorry book all around. I could not get around the fact that he smelled and that she would even let him touch her. This book made me sick.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	1	I really enjoyed this book, but I thought his daugthers and brother should have had bigger part in the book. The fairy is the best part of this series.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	I have never read a book so full of useless babble in my life. This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. This book had potential but it was lost from page 1. This book was full of weirdos and misfits, including the protagonist. Each characters reflection was more boring and stupid than the one before. I can only tell you not to waste your money because it would be a big waste.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	This has to be one the most boring books I have ever read. I cannot believe this was published. The characters just rambled on forever about nothing. The only reason I finished this books is because I paid for this dreary piece of garbage. The sad part is when the child is the best character in the book, this book was a pathetic piece of babbling junk.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	I started to read Flashback and put that down because is was ridiculous. So since I had another one of Cait London's books, Hidden Secrets, I thought I try that one instead, what a mistake. I cannot believe these books were published. I have never read such terrible writing. I am literally forcing myself to read this book because I bought it. I can't seem to get into this book because of her writing style, something is missing. There is no flow to her writing, its like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing, wacky characters who make no sense, namely, Cherry. Marlo fighting her feelings and seeing the color red, Spence, tough guy whose so full of guilt over everything, enough with guilt trips. I can't think about picking up Flashback again, I just trashing it. I will never try another one of her books, she is a terrible writer.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	0	0	I will make this review short and to the point. I thought Fern Michaels' books were childish, which they are, but this author is right up there with her. I have never read a book so full of irritating characters, every last character in this book was annoying, the story was silly and the writing terrible. This book doesn't even deserve 1 star but that was the lowest I could rate it.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	0	I love my Kindle, but I wish I had waited for the Nook. Not only does B&N have over a million books to download but the prices are lower. There are so many books I want but they are not Kindle-ready, Amazon should have been better prepared like B&N. As Kindle owners' we should never come across a book we can't buy for our Kindle, or rarely come across one.
A1DD375RPAY6K4	1	0	This product is better than the toothbrush heads I buy in the store. The store brand always became loose and useless after a month. This product is stronger, more durable and lasting. Will definitely order from this seller again.
A1DDD8TR7W5HX	0	0	I bought the hardback at Sam's a few years ago. I invested waaay too much time and money.This book was so beautifully written - but the story sucked. The author is certainly gifted. But i hated the book.Don't know to this day why(or how) I finished it.The characters were so very unlikeable - all of them. Except maybe for the black servant. He was ok. Not a redeeming quality assigned to any of them.The history part (Napoleonic Wars) was on the verge of interesting, but wasn't.There's a reason this book is NOT a movie. Nothing happens.I was most uncharitable when donated this book to the Y for their quarterly book sale. God forgive me.
A1DDD8TR7W5HX	0	0	bought this as a christmas present, but decided to keep it. so just opened it today.will have to review this product later..as the 2 AA batteries were NOT included.one * for that great annoyance.
A1DDH5U33CSNBV	1	1	This peeler works great! Your hand doesn't get in the way of the work as sometimes happens with the traditional design. I haven't used the potato eye gouger and probably won't, but the peeler is ergonomic and well made.
A1DDH5U33CSNBV	0	0	Perhaps I just got a bad one, but it always read significantly (50 to 75 degrees) lower than my oven indicated. Over time it's gotten even worse and is now useless. Spend a couple of dollars more and get something decent.
A1DDH5U33CSNBV	0	0	This mandoline worked pretty well for me for a couple of years. Then the plastic handle broke off and I could not use it anymore. If I do replace it I will definitely get a heavier-duty model. I say "if" because the utility of these slicers is roughly offset by the danger they pose to your fingers. That's because the pusher-thingee that they include is awkward to use most of the time.
A1DDH5U33CSNBV	1	1	I have several of these GI type tool bags in cotton and nylon that I use for different purposes. This one has a heavy duty brass zipper and the nylon fabric that won't rot for a long time. Frankly, I like the standard heavy cotton fabric just as well, but this brass zipper is as good as it gets. Besides the bag's high quality, it's a very practical size for several uses. I use one for an extended motorcycle tool bag, with an enhanced set of tools, tire repair kit, electric air pump, etc. I use another for my other garage hand tools; another holds a full set of tie-down straps and ratchets; another gets used a range and ammunition bag for shooting. It's large enough to hold a lot of stuff, small enough to still be handy, practical enough to fulfill many different uses, and durable enough to last about a lifetime.
A1DDRWAV7VWCQN	0	1	this bluray will not play in my Sony BDP-S370 player. I tried 2 discs same result disc loads up and freezes, very frustrating never saw a problem like this with any other bluray title.
A1DDRWAV7VWCQN	1	1	just heard the sad news that Ronnie passed today at 64 years old, this album stands as a testament as to what Rock was all about back then and today and will live on..RIP Ronnie Montrose
A1DDTAFPTBXKO3	0	0	This book should not be available to children. Owen is/was Professor Emeritus at University of Alberta, but the book contains a &quot;Germany is the origin of all good people&quot; type of theory. It is fascinating for those interested in the origins of WWII or racism in general, but not recommended as history.
A1DDTAFPTBXKO3	1	1	Typical Sharpe fare-but reveals more about Sharpe himself than his usual. A Sharpe fan will find his understanding of the author considerably deepened. Henry Wilt and Commandant Van Heerden could have collaborated on this book. I was grateful for this, but some reviewers seem to be disappointed. Funnier than average. As many uncontrollable laughter moments as Indecent Exposure. Logical development of Porterhouse Blue. I will never forget how to make a Dog's Nose. Sharpe's understanding of American business practice may leave a lot to be desired, but I don't see why this bothers some people so much.
A1DDYJ2G4C2IKX	1	1	Great tracks by Pac, Kurupt, Snoop, Tray Dee needs to release a solo album, Ice Cube was off the heezy, and what about Storm? &quot;Mash For Our Dreams&quot; remains on my playlist. This was an album I was reserved about buying, but it always comes back into my deck to remain a must in my collection. A must buy!
A1DDYJ2G4C2IKX	1	1	This was a very consistent album. The beats from Khayree were amazing. I first heard &quot;Sic Wid Dis&quot; on a compilation, and I soon went and bought the album. It was hard to believe he was so young when he dropped this cut. The lyrics sound like he had been in the rap game for about five years. With the last line of the album being &quot;This is straight from Mall, ( ) y'all, sincerely&quot; it puts the perfect ending to one of the tighest albums ever.
A1DDYJ2G4C2IKX	1	1	This is off the heezy fo' sheezy. Some of the tightest beats around and that crazy rapping style that only comes from 40 Fonzarelli. With the Click in full force along with 2Pac, Spice 1, and the dopest Vallejo rapper, Mac Mall, this album is straight cavi.
A1DDYJ2G4C2IKX	0	1	When I first put this CD in the deck, &quot;Hello&quot; got me real excited. Unfortunately, the rest of the disc did not hold up. Sure &quot;You can do it&quot; is great, but the rest of the album seemed to fall off a bit. I still like every other album, from &quot;Amerikkka's Most Wanted&quot; to &quot;Lethal Injection&quot; to &quot;War&quot; as well as those in between, but the one bright spot was hearing a sneak preview of what N.W.A has in store.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	As I sit here with my latest haul of CD purchases, I realize what a wonderful little gadget this is. I probably got my Maxell CD opener before amazon.com even existed. It still works great and has opened hundreds of CDs for me. Blade still retracts properly when not in use. One negative is it may score cardboard CD cases if you're not careful.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	I need something to prevent me from twisting my knee, as well as provide light support and stability for the medial collateral ligament as I run around on my job or work with my dog. This brace does the job, is lightweight and doesn't annoy the back of my knee. One that's truly comfortable against my skin will get the fifth star, however it doesn't exist yet and this one is not too bad. I prefer to wear a brace on the outside of my pants anyway, so I can remove it easily if I'm just sitting at a desk. The beige one was difficult to keep clean, so I'm now ordering the black one.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	0	1	This jar works well, but keeping it clean is a problem. It's being used for non-fat milk and after several months, I am not able to keep what seems to be milk fat from accumulating on (in?) the gasket even with soaking it and scrubbing it daily. The only way I could get any of it off was scraping with my nails, and that damaged the gasket in short order. It leaks too much with no gasket. Since the jar is otherwise exactly what I needed, twice I've ordered new lids just for the gasket ($6 each + shipping), and the same thing happened. I've tried to contact the company about ordering just the gaskets. Twice. But I've gotten no response other than "we'll get back to you within 48 hours". Both times, 48 hours turned into weeks, and still no reply. So far including the purchase price it's cost about $35 in about 18 mos. It's getting too expensive and time consuming to keep using it, so I'm looking to replace it with something else. If you want to use this to keep milk for kids, or maybe even cereal with milk, look elsewhere.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	The band description in the Desolation Angels link is mismatched with this recording. "Anthem" is not from the band with David Wall on vocals. The UK band's boxed set, "Feels Like Thunder", is available through [...](Since I've never heard "Anthem", I've given it 4 stars only to maintain the current average)
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	This was the first package opener I ever saw and it made so much sense that I grabbed it immediately. I've now used an OpenX for at many years and it's rare when it can't do the job.Make about a 3/4" slice with the small blade then hook in the larger one. The trick to it, and the hardest part too, is to hook into only ONE layer of plastic. On some packages this is easiest on the "bubble" part of the package, not an edge. After that, its very easy to use. If you need to get documentation out, it's then much easier to get that single layer near the edges after you've cut out the item from the bubble. Neatness does not have to count.I've had three of these and eventually lost or misplaced two. On this last one, I broke the plastic on it's "lower jaw" after two or three years of use and abuse, but it seemed to be starting to getting dull anyway. After all, it's basically just utility knife blades in a fancy handle and they all will eventually get dull. It's still usable but not as safely, so I am ordering a couple more. Fortunately they're pretty cheap and well worth the price.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	Note: The 4000 and 7000 are identical except the 7000 is wireless and comes with a mouse I can't use.I managed to hurt the extensor muscles/tendons on the back of my hand and they are being very slow to heal. Typing has been very painful on a standard keyboard. Having not found any mouse/pointer I can use with my right hand (tried many different configurations of mice, touch pad, trackballs, wacom tablet, etc) I have had to learn to use a mouse with my left hand. After learning how very slow voice recognition "typing" is, a few weeks ago in desperation I tried the 4000 at work. Success! I now have the 7000 too, which I use at home.At the dis-ergonomic computer desk at work with the front riser on, or tilting it in my lap at home, I can now type again. I'm slower than before, gone from about 70-90+ wpm to about 60, but at least I can use it! It's much faster than voice recognition anyway.Finding the "home row" not nearly as automatic for me as with a standard keyboard so I have to pay more attention, and some of the keys I typed with my right are now on the left (such as "b" and 6), but all that is improving with time and practice. I am not having any problems with the space bar like some have mentioned. It is on the noisy side and I have a feeling my nails will make quick work of the stickers for the letters on the keys.It's not perfect, but it's really been an excellent solution for me.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	1	In my employer's infinite wisdom, the powers-that-be bought these instead of the higher volume laser printers we used to have. For at least a year, maybe closer to 18 months, this little workhorse has valiantly done it's best to keep up, usually printing 100+ pages a day, every day, if not much more. It's never turned off.I am the one called on whenever there's a problem beyond changing cartridges. Most of those are wear and tear, permissions problems on this computer with its 16 users, or someone "accidentally" changed the wrong option. Because of this, when we got new XP computers I left it as a plug and play device. It worked well until I needed more features. It's a plain printer with few bells and whistles, though installing the drivers will add a few more features. The flat top is convenient as a shelf until I need to open it to change cartridges. However, it seems wider than it needs to be.Only now is it having paper handling issues. It rarely jams, but on about half the print jobs at least one sheet will not load correctly. Only a few lines get printed and the rest of the page prints on the next sheet. The rollers prefer to avoid picking up the last few pages in the cartridge, easily solved by loading more into it. I suspect that is a wear issue, but then it is quite over matched for the job anyway. I have used card stock, cheap paper, and high quality photo paper in it, all without additional problems.I mostly use "fast draft" and that really helps keep the ink consumption lower. Otherwise it's about average and has worked well with the refurbished cartridges "they" buy. With regular color cartridges, it can make nice photos, more than good enough to hang on the office wall. I'd imagine with an actual photo cartridge it might be better. Loading the ink is a bit easier than in my old HP 990 since the opening seems a bit bigger. I particularly like the "Black Text" option, which many others don't have.I am now buying one for my home, which is a much more suitable environment for it to begin with. It's far from perfect, but it's the best I've worked with in a while.
A1DEB41ZPRF3I4	1	0	I am the eternal beginner who walks into a guitar shop and badly plays the opening bars to Stairway to Heaven because it's the fanciest thing I know. Yes I know I would be banned in some shops. After innumerous tries at improving my playing skills in the past 45 years, I recently decided to take yet another stab at it. The biggest reason I never got beyond basic chords was the awful soreness in my left fingers from pressing the strings. I'd want to keep playing and practicing, but I'd have to put it down from the pain. That gets old really fast. Last time I really tried was many years ago. What did I know about string materials and weights?A couple of weeks ago, a friend broke an ancient string on my 70's Ventura dreadnought. I looked around and saw these here on Amazon. Silk? Really? (no) Light? (yes) Martin? (made in Mexico) On Sale? (oh yes) OK!Well, I am not putting my fingers directly on silk as I hoped, They're are on silver plated steel and the four lower strings are "Slvrpltd Copper on Nylon & Steel". But still!I might be able to get all the way through a first level teaching book this time and I'm just thrilled. These have been on my guitar for a whopping two days and I am very surprised how well they're working for me already. Every time I've picked it up it's barely gone out of tune - which I've never experienced with new strings that usually seem severely out of tune in minutes. I can put it down for the session not from pain, but with fingers still able to play. That's a first for meToo soon to tell how far I'll get this time, of course, but now without that pain my chances are higher than ever before. If you're a beginner, buy these, really.=============================================Update 12-2-2012These strings do seem to be life changing, since they've gotten me to really start playing guitar more seriously than ever before. I can now say these seem to be the ultimate beginner's strings. They helped me get really going with minimal finger tip pain. I played on them for quite a while, started classical guitar lessons about four months after the previous post and I am still taking them. Due to other pain issues, I am now playing a Telecaster that seems to suit my hands better than acoustic and classical guitars. But if I hadn't tried these strings, I really don't think I'd have gotten this far.
A1DEE4JAWDR93E	0	1	I have read several of Mr. Hastings' books and enjoyed all of them except this one. I feel like I missed very important information especially in chapter three. Yes, I could have looked up the French, though translating whole sentences is difficult though in some cases I did. My chain of thought was constantly interrupted trying to translate the French. It is arrogant on his part and condescending to expect the average reader to understand French in order to read his book. The practice of using French was very prevalent in fiction before 1960 and always irritated me when I was younger. It still irritates me. Would a Frenchman ignorant of English enjoy reading a French history that used English frequently, I expect not. Mr. Hastings I am impressed with your command of French, alas I do not posses your fluency.
A1DEE4JAWDR93E	1	1	I remember arguing repeatedly with my cousin's husband about this race. I was for Johnson and he was for Goldwater. At the time I thought Goldwater was a lunatic that would plunge the country into a World War. At the time I also deplored his stand on civil rights, although later I came to understand that his stand was not as it was portrayed. I saw the TV ad of the little girl and the atomic bomb several times. I was surprised to read it was pulled after one showing. That ad made a big impact on me. Moyers' part came as a surprise to me. I can't view him on TV any longer with out thinking he is a hypocrite. Johnson was saying let Asian boys die for their country, not American boys. After the election it became apparent that the whole while he was claiming Goldwater would expand the war, he and McNamara were already planning on sending in more troops. I was a young man that would be drafted two years later. By the time I was drafted there were already a half a million Americans in Viet Nam. Johnson made the mistake of listening to the generals who have never met a war they didn't like. Obama is making the same mistake.In later years I came to admire Goldwater for his honesty. Whether you agreed with him or not, he was consistent in his beliefs, a trait missing in today's politicians. My admiration for him grew with his part in removing Nixon from office. His views on the military and the reforms he wanted to make were overdue. I was working at the Seattle Center when he gave a speech during the campaign. I remember a group of people in the stands unfolding a large banner supporting Johnson and the crowd booing loudly. This was done on cue when he repeated his "Extremism in the defense of liberty....".Having lived through this period made the book even more fascinating. The book details so much that the general public did not know at the time.It is an excellent book.
A1DEE4JAWDR93E	0	1	Before I bought the book I was aware of the problem the church faced in determining the correct date for Easter and the reasons behind the adoption of the Gregorian calendar.This book for the most part is not for the lay person, by that I mean those of us that are not up to speed on Trigonometry and Geometry. I have read books on physics for the lay person involving quantum mechanics that did not require the proficiency in math that this book does. For us the preface and the first chapter will pretty much suffice and be quite satisfying. I have visited the churches in Rome and Bologna. In the Basilica of San Petronio I purchased a small book of 25 pages with a chart in the back for where the sun would fall (minute differences) for every day of the year. The small book for 5 euros explained the mathematics behind the construction of the meridian in terms that I could readily understand. If the math is comprehensible to you then this is a great book.
A1DEE4JAWDR93E	1	1	Speer spends most of the book trying to justify his actions and apologizing. He wants you to believe that he finally realized what he was part of without really accepting responsibility. I gave it four stars because it has value in describing events and people. There was probably no one closer to Hitler.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	Tammy Grimes made a memorable Broadway musical debut in The Unsinkable Molly Brown in 1960, and appeared in several other shows, including Forty-Second Street. Her 1963 album was called "The Unmistakable Tammy Grimes," and her voice certainly is unlike anyone else's--somewhere between a purr and a foghorn--and I happen to love it. Collectables Records has released on CD both of Grimes' Columbia albums, whose 24 tracks are predominantly show tunes, including "I'm Just Wild About Harry," "I'll Be Seeing You," "Anything Goes," "How Long Has This Been Going On?", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie," "Miss Otis Regrets," "Gonna Build a Mountain," and a delightful rendition of "I'll Do Anything" from Oliver!
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	I've been wishing for this one over many years, and at last Rhino Handmade has re-released this soundtrack recording from the 1968 film version, starring Petula Clark, Fred Astaire, Don Francks, and Tommy Steele. It's one of the rare instances where the soundtrack is better than the original cast album--both in terms of sound and the quality of the performances. The Burton Lane/E.Y. Harburg score includes "Look to the Rainbow," "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?", "Old Devil Moon," "If This Isn't Love," and "When I'm Not Near the Girl I Love."
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	This is the first great American operetta, first produced in 1891, with music by Reginald deKoven and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. DeKoven was a composer of modest gifts, and never was able to repeat the success of Robin Hood, with its breakout hits "Oh Promise Me," and "Brown October Ale." Frankly, I never expected a full-length recording of this score, but to the rescue is the Ohio Light Opera Company, which has been at the forefront of making classic American operettas available on CD. A bit creaky, but a fascinating snapshot into the early years of American musical theater.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	Philip Chaffin's first CD, Where Do I Go From You, is never far from my CD player, so I was pleased to see the arrival of his much delayed second outing, Warm Spring Night. Where the earlier CD was a salute to the Big Band Era--at least in style--this time the feeling is more intimate, with songs chosen for their dramatic as well as melodic appeal. Chaffin's warm tenor voice is just right for the exquisite "Haunted Heart," and he caresses the hell out of "My Romance" and "That's All." I was delighted to find one of my favorites, "There's A Room In My House" (from the ill-fated A Family Affair), and a surprisingly effective "Out of My Dreams" (from Oklahoma!). Chaffin also offers a mini-autobiography of himself that sweetly unaffected and frequently touching--just like his performances. [Ghostlight Records]
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	I was not familiar with Paula Jarvis until hearing her beautiful recording of "Candle On the Water," which I knew only from Helen Reddy's recording. Jarvis does it with quiet intensity, a trait that can be heard throughout this lovely CD.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	I don't usually like compilation CDs of this sort, since they pull the songs out of their original contexts. But, in this case, the choices are thoughtful and the way they have been intermixed throughout this two-CD set are exemplary.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	I have heard complaints (and horror stories) about Roxio Creator, but I have always found the program easy to use and trouble free. I started with 5.0 and now am on 8.0, and find it suits my needs and does a good job in copying music CDs, creating compilation CDs, converting CD tracks to MP3 (complete with artist and track info) for play back on my MP3 player, sound capture (for example, from Internet broadcasts), sound editing of audio tracks from a CD or other source, and creating data discs. I haven't used the DVD features, and probably won't, since that's not something I need to do.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	This is the only non-prescription nightguard that has worked for me. In fact, it works better than the $500 nightguard that my dentist made for me. I've tried several other low-priced nightguards, and they were either uncomfortable or left me sore in the morning. This one is adjustable, and pliable, so there are no sharp edges and it fits my mouth exactly. And the price is right.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	0	1	There is a beautifully recorded studio cast, recorded in the UK, available for those who want the complete score. Amazon carries it; just search for: Song Of Norway 1990 London Studio Cast
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	While there may be individual recordings of the symphonies that excel, this is the best set available, with consistent performances and excellent sound. I'm not thrilled with the packaging (slippery individual cardboard sleeves inside a cardboard box), but it does make for compact storage. Nice choice of "filler" music, as well.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	0	1	I purchased this with fond memories of the film, which I know well, and watched it with a friend who had not seen the movie before. As reported, much of the film is too dark to make out what's going on, so I had to explain to my friend what was transpiring on screen. In essence, all the night scenes are in total blackness (in the original, there was enough light to see the action), and even some of the other scenes are also difficult to make out entirely. Shame on the releasing company for putting out this classic film in this sorry condition.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	Simply a terrific CD. I have this in my car player, and friends often ask me who the singer is. Trainor has a wonderful voice and is backed up here by a great small combo that really swings.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	I love the Big Band sound of the 1940s, and although the band here isn't big, it's terrific, and so are the arrangements. A friend gave this to me, and it's one I play over and over. I recommend it.
A1DEHPRSH4BF2P	1	1	This is an exemplary performance of this work, with Stokowski bringing to the music a real sense of American history in terms of the music itself, and the scenes & subjects the music is portraying. This is my favorite of all recordings of "The River"
A1DEM5M9Z83VGI	1	1	If you are looking for another pop-driven record with dance beats and twink inspired ballads from Christina Aguilera, don't hold your breath. This is definitely different from her self-titled debut album. This is more of a rock chick driven album, using producers like Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes, Pink), and even collaborating with Alicia Keys. Although her debut album was kind of tame, this album will eventually establish her as a vocal powerhouse with the likes of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and even Aretha Franklin. This is definitly a grown-up Christina, addressing adult issues, and even using a little adult adjectives! Overall, this is a coming out of a shell for Christina. I think it is going to be a classic, because it is so personal of an album. It is worthy to be in your personal collection, even if it has to share a place with Eminem!
A1DENL96FZK2QV	0	0	Over the years, Bruce has taken his followers from 82nd Street to Thunder Road to Darlington County, but now he's travelling some path of inner enlightenment that only seems to reside in the most desolate parts of the Southwest. Unfortunately, I got off the wrong exit, and still waiting for him in the swamps of Jersey. I grew up on this guy. I saw him at the Stone Pony before he was on the cover of Time and Newsweek. I remember breaking up with my girlfriend, heading home alone, cranking up Darkness on the Edge, and wailing along with him to Something in the Night. I miss that guy. He's always sung in the context of the America left behind, but his E-street compilations, even the Rising, have an element of joy and energy that his solo executions lack. I'm not saying we need to go visit Lucky Town again, but he could learn from U2 - CDs don't need to be drearily introspective to be meaningful. If you're a Springsteen fan, this album is interesting. Bruce used to be so much more...
A1DENL96FZK2QV	1	1	This game was sooo good! I highly recomend it! I really liked how you never know what's going to happen next!!! And now you have a camera phone!! Bes and George are also always there to help as always! I liked that.If you're a Nancy Drew fan you should get this game!!! Why else would I give it a 5 star rating?!?! ANd there are also some SPOOKY surprises waiting for you!!!I almost thoughtI was going to cry at the end because it was over!!!!!!!!!!ANyway i think you shoul get it even if you aren't a Nancy Drew fan!

Brings the album back home.Final Rating: 10/10, or 5/5 whatever you want to call it. A must own.
A1DENQCMHOW2P1	1	1	It's not Rockin the Suburbs. There. I said it. But why would you want it to be? This album is much more mellow, but it still has the signature Ben piano licks, it's just a much more contemplative album. His sense of humor is still evident though, on tracks like Jesusland.Overall: Great Album. 5/5.
A1DEPYJ1X30DUU	0	0	I replaced the TV under the roof of my covered patio. The old TV had a matte screen the new one a 20 inch flat CRT has a glossy finish. Of course the glare is now much worse than with the matte CRT screen. I searched for glare filters and would up with a EX10XXL. To my surprise the filter has a high gloss finish. Little to no glare reduction in this application. There is a slight increase in contrast. Overall not worth buying.
A1DEPYJ1X30DUU	0	0	Yawn.....Watched the first hour and gave up so save your money for a better one. I do not nderstand the high ratings for this SLOW moving film.
A1DEPYJ1X30DUU	1	1	I have a patio by our pool and the neighbors tree is messy this time of year, first dropping leaves and now little seeds. I was tired of dragging out my corded blower so I bought this. The battery lasts for 3 or 4 quick touch-ups on an area about 400 sq feet. And it is small enough to hide behind the furniture on our patio so is always ready.One of the best gadgets I have.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	When it came to writing tales of the New York City Police Department, no one did it quite as good as the late Mike McAlary. He truly had a feel for the streets and the world cops lived (and died) in, and it came through in his newspaper articles and books. In "Cop Shot," the author graphically recounts the assassination of Police Officer Edward Byrne, barely twenty-two years old, cold-bloodedly shot to death by Queens crack dealers while he was guarding the home of a witness preparing to testify against them. McAlary vividly describes the violent world of the local drug dealers, for whom the crack epidemic was a cash cow which furnished them with riches beyond their wildest dreams. The reader is introduced, also, to the hardcore group of detectives who dedicated every waking moment to bringing the murderers to justice, working above and beyond the call of duty for a cause they believed in. I know that the phrase "non-stop page turner" is often bandied about by book reviewers, but in my opinion this truly applies to "Cop Shot." If you enjoy cop stories, especially case histories of the NYPD, you can't go wrong with this book.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	If you enjoy the music of Louis Prima, buy this DVD - no ifs, ands, or buts. Rare photos, movie clips, and television footage document Prima's career from his early years in New Orleans up through his final performances in the 1970s. Interviews with Prima's brother, Leon, two of his five wives, Keely Smith and Gia Maione, saxophonist Sam Butera, drummer Jimmy Vincent, and others make this highly informative and enjoyable. Of course, it is the Big Man himself who steals the show. I guarantee that only minutes into this tribute to a great performer you'll be tapping your toes to his unique swinging style and understand why he was truly "The Wildest." Enjoy!
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	It isn't often that I use the word "absorbing" in my reviews, but this term certainly applies here. Once I began reading this book, I found it almost impossible to put down. "The Westies" is a gripping, dramatic narrative of the rise and fall of a group of insanely violent street-level hoodlums who seized control of all of the racketeering interests throughout the "Hell's Kitchen" (it has since been gentrified to the more fashionable "Clinton") section of Manhattan's West Side during the Seventies and Eighties. Essentially drunks and drug abusers, these fellows not only killed without hesitation, but often over nothing more consequential than a real or imagined slight. Moreover, it was frequently their practice to dismember their victims' bodies in an effort to thwart identification by the authorities. It was this innate savagery and utter ruthlessness which subsequently brought them to the attention of Paul Castellano and the Gambino crime family, with whom they forged an uneasy working relationship. Why do I give this book such an enthusiastic thumbs up? Simple. Even though I read this book when it was first published eighteen years ago, I appreciate it even more now. It's a first-rate New York crime story which, I repeat, will keep the reader glued to its pages.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Interesting, well researched biography of Francis Crowley, a small-time car thief and stickup artist who became the object of a statewide manhunt after he cold-bloodedly shot and killed a Nassau County, New York, police officer in 1931. Crowley and his partner-in-crime, Rudolph "Fats" Duringer, who was himself a suspect in the shooting death of a dance-hall hostess whom he murdered after she resisted his advances, were traced to an apartment on Manhattan's upper West Side on May 7, 1931. The ensuing gun battle between the fugitives and literally hundreds of policemen drew record crowds of onlookers and lasted for hours before the two were finally overpowered and taken into custody. This book was published in 1951, about twenty years after these events had occurred, and the author drew upon personal interviews with many of the detectives and other law-enforcement officials who worked feverishly to bring the killers to justice. Thus we are treated to a wealth of information regarding what really happened behind the headlines. The forward was written by Dr. Richard H. Hoffmann, a distinguished psychiatrist who examined Crowley during pre-trial proceedings and described him as having had "the face of a choirboy, the mind of an imbecile, and the heart of a diamond-back rattlesnake." Both hoodlums were separately tried for murder, convicted, and electrocuted at the death house at Sing Sing Prison. Crowley, who gloried in the nickname "Two Gun" bestowed upon him by the press because of the two pistols with which he was always armed, was only 19 years old at the time of his death. While the Crowley case has been touched upon in several true-crime books, this is, as far as I know, his only full-length biography. Definitely worth reading.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Excellent, first-rate biography of the mobster whom the press called "Crazy Joe" Gallo (no one else did, at least not to his face), who led a bloody insurrection against Mafia family boss Joseph Profaci in the early Sixties, spent more than eight years in various New York State prisons for extortion, and then revolted against Profaci's successor, Joseph Colombo, upon his release in 1971. This is more than a simple recital of a gangster's exploits, although it does cover Gallo's criminal history in sufficient detail. It is an engrossing, in-depth examination of the complexities of the subject's character and how he was perceived by those in his orbit. Augmented by interviews with Gallo's two wives, both his biological daughter and stepdaughter, various non-criminal friends and acquaintances, and Gallo himself, the real Crazy Joe emerges as an intelligent, curious individual whose interest in philosophy and the arts contrasted sharply with the gangster persona which made him such a highly feared individual in the local hoodlum community. By no means does the author attempt to make excuses for Gallo's violent ways, but it becomes clear in these pages that there was more to the man than the the newspaper headlines which sensationalized his bloodletting.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	This is the kind of story many would consider incredible hadn't these events actually taken place. Years ago a short-lived television series (two seasons, to be exact) called "Tightrope" aired in which a young actor named Michael Connors portrayed an undercover police officer known only as "Nick" who, week after week, successfully infiltrated various underworld gangs and operations. It was a fictional TV show, nothing more, designed solely for the entertainment of the viewing audience. In 1976 Special Agent Joseph D. Pistone of the FBI made that role a reality. Under the guise of jewel thief "Donnie Brasco," Pistone entered the dangerous world of organized crime and eventually penetrated it at a level so deep that he was actually "proposed" for membership in La Cosa Nostra when the "books" were opened. Renting an apartment on Manhattan's upper East Side (a lot more affordable then), Pistone began to frequent a local restaurant where he got to know a few "connected" guys. This led to his broadening his circle of associates to include, first, a Colombo-affiliated crew in Brooklyn and, later, a Manhattan-based faction of the Bonanno family. The fact that he was accepted and gained the trust of these otherwise wary, street-smart "wiseguys" is a testament to how well Pistone played his role, knowing how far to push the envelope in tricky situations and when to step back. The operation, which lasted six years, came to an abrupt halt when Pistone was given a "contract" to "whack" a Bonanno rival. By that time, however, the Mob had been irreparably damaged. Within weeks of the startling revelation that "Brasco" was in fact an FBI agent, a $500,000 bounty was placed on his life and the Mob began to exact revenge on those who had originally "sponsored" him. One, Benjamin "Lefty Guns" Ruggiero, was picked up by FBI agents while on his way to almost certain doom after having been "sent for," or summoned, to a Little Italy bar by his former pals. Two others weren't so lucky. In August, 1981, the badly decomposed body of one Dominick "Sonny Black" Napolitano, a capo who maintained a special fondness for Pistone even after learning he was an agent, turned up in a Staten Island creek, minus both hands. Seven months later, in March, 1982, Anthony Mirra, a psychopath who had been the first to introduce Pistone to the Bonanno crew, was found shot to death behind the wheel of his car in a downtown Manhattan garage. Co-written by Mr. Pistone himself and Richard Woodley, "Donnie Brasco" reveals the gritty, day-to-day workings of the Cosa Nostra lifestyle as it actually exists (or should I say existed?) and not the honorable, glamorized version of Don Vito Corleone's world as depicted in "The Godfather."
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	The quintessential New York City mob film, in a class by itself, my only five-star review to date (and I'd give it more if I could). Based on the book "Wiseguy" by Nicholas Pileggi, Martin Scorsese's brilliant masterpiece introduces us to Henry Hill, as enacted by Ray Liotta, a disarming, likeable sort who can never be initiated into the Mafia because he's only half Italian (his father is Irish). Nevertheless, the "boys" who hang out at the neighborhood cabstand have taken a liking to the adolescent Henry and use him to run various errands. As he grows older, Henry forms a close association with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the violent, trigger-happy Tommy De Vito (played to the hilt by a terrifying Joe Pesci). This film has the audience in its grip from the opening sequence and doesn't let go until it ends three hours later. Frank Vincent has a brief but memorable role as the ill-fated Billy Batts, and all of the supporting characters come across quite credibly as well. In my opinion, the only weak point in this film (if you can even call it that) was the casting of Paul Sorvino as the local mob boss. I felt he brought very little to his role. A much better choice (again, in my opinion) would have been someone like Robert Loggia. De Niro's performance is flawless, as usual, and Pesci dominates every scene he's in (he won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). "GoodFellas" was released in the fall of 1990, nearly eighteen years ago, and, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a single gangster movie produced before or since which even begins to approach its cinematic perfection.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Based on Chazz Paliminteri's autobiographical one-man play, "A Bronx Tale" is an impressive coming-of-age story about a young man, Calogero, or "C," as he is called, growing up in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx during the racially turbulent Sixties. The boy is torn between the ethical standards set by his scrupulously honest bus driver father, Lorenzo, and the flashy appeal of "Sonny," the charismatic local crime boss. When Calogero, as a mere child, witnesses Sonny shoot and kill a man in a street dispute and refuses to pick him out of a hastily organized lineup moments later, Sonny takes the boy under his wing, much to the displeasure of his father. In his own way, Sonny is looking out for the young man's best interests. He is both paternal and protective, urging C to stop hanging out with his troublemaking friends, and emphasizing the importance of a good education. He also tutors young Calogero in the ways of the street. "That way," says C, "I'll be twice as smart as everyone else." Eventually there is a heated confrontation between the boy's father and the gangster, but the lure of Sonny's lifestyle - a flashy red Cadillac, women, nice clothes, "respect" - is too strong for the youngster to resist. There is an interesting assortment of supporting characters - Eddie Mush (the unluckiest gambler in the world), Tony Toupee (so called because of his ill-fitting hairpiece), Frankie Coffee Cake (whose acne-scarred face reminded everyone of a Drake's coffee cake) - and a host of others who apparently made an indelible impression on the young Palminteri. There are several memorable scenes - the humorous antics during a basement craps game; the invasion of Sonny's bar by a gang of bikers, to their regret; Sonny's advising his protege on dating etiquette. Robert De Niro, in his directorial debut, plays Lorenzo, but it is Chazz Palminteri's Sonny who dominates the film throughout. The ending is sad, poignant, and touching, but of course I won't go into that here on the assumption that you haven't seen this movie. As a lay person I'm unable to intelligently critique the technical aspects of any film, but I can state in all honesty that this is one movie I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Without a doubt, the most in-depth biography I've read of ANY celebrity to date. This is probably the real Sinatra, warts and all. Well-researched, highly readable, credible, no cheap sensational revelations in these pages. Written while Sinatra was still alive, the author traces the life of one of America's foremost performers from his youth in Hoboken, New Jersey, to his meteoric rise in the entertainment industry. His marriages, his tumultuous affairs with some of the most glamorous women in the world, his mob ties, they're all closely examined in an objective and unbiased way. If you want to know what the volatile world of Frank Sinatra was really like, then this is the book to read.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	There's very little I can add to the previous reviews except to say that this was the reason I bought a CD player years ago. More out of curiosity than anything else, I happened to pick up a copy of "Louis Prima: the Capitol Collectors Series" in its audiocassette format back in the early Nineties. Let me assure you, this is Prima at his best, during the wild and swinging Fifties, when his was "THE" act to see in Las Vegas. From the opening number, "Just A Gigolo," I was hooked. There isn't a single track (with the possible exception of "Beep! Beep!") that I didn't enjoy. The man was a master at his craft. No one's a bigger fan of Dean Martin's than me, but when you compare Dino's versions of "Oh, Marie" and "Buona Sera" to Louis', Prima blows him away. Feeling depressed? Down in the dumps? Put on this CD and you'll soon be "jump, jive and wailin'" along with Louis, his then wife Keely Smith, Sam Butera, and the rest of the Wildest. Guaranteed!
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Originally published in 1961, this is a fine study of the so-called "beer wars" which ravaged the streets of Chicago during Prohibition. While in large part a biography of the "Big Fellow," Al Capone, it also examines the lives of the other gang leaders who carved up the Windy City into various territorial boundaries designed to avoid conflict, with negative results. The author traveled from his native England to the U.S. to research material for this project, and what emerges is a vivid depiction of the gangland scene as it actually existed, with no sensational embellishment. Detailed portraits of the North Side gang, the Genna brothers, the O'Donnells, Frank McErlane, and many other notorious mob figures are provided. Unlike similar books written during this period, "The Bootleggers and Their Era" withstood the test of time and holds up well today.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	0	Co-written by Robert Cromie and Joseph Pinkston, perhaps the world's foremost authorities on this particular outlaw, "Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life," is a factual, credible, informative biography of one of the most celebrated criminals in the annals of crime. No sensational revelations are unearthed, no secrets revealed, no outlandish accusations. Simply put, one of the better Dillinger books written (and I don't say this because I happen to have an original copy autographed by Robert Cromie in my possession).
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	This book lay gathering dust on a shelf in my home for fourteen years because I didn't think I'd be interested in the subject matter, the Asian organized crime problem in the U.S. during the mid-Eighties to early Nineties. I acquired it during a chance encounter with the author, T.J. English himself, who was gracious enough to autograph a copy and give it to me after I told him how much I had enjoyed his (at that time) previous work, "The Westies." Last week, in search of something to read, I picked it up - and couldn't put it down until I had finished the last page. "Born to Kill" is the riveting tale of a violent gang of youthful Vietnamese refugees who not only preyed on merchants in New York City's Chinatown district, but extended their activities to such far-flung states as Texas and Georgia as well. They were eventually brought down by one of their own who, guilt-ridden because he thought he had taken part in the brutal murder of a Vietnamese shopkeeper in Georgia, decided to cooperate with a joint task force of ATF agents and NYPD detectives dedicated to bringing this group to justice. Enough said. I won't reveal anything more in this review because I don't want to ruin it for the rest of you. Just don't make the same mistake I did and assume it won't hold your interest. Trust me, it will.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	Not just another chronicle of the rise and fall of the Mob or a John Gotti bio churned out during the "Dapper Don's" murderous heyday. This is a credible, factual, highly readable history of the five Cosa Nostra "families" in the New York area beginning with the Castellammarese War of the early Thirties to the downfall of the Bonanno Family with the conviction of its Boss, "Big Joey" Massino, in 2004. The author, Selwyn Raab, spent some twenty-five years as an investigative reporter for the New York Times probing criminal justice matters and organized crime, and his familiarity with the Mob and access to what really went on behind the headlines comes across in these pages. Luciano, Genovese, Costello, Profaci, Bonanno, Gambino, Gigante, and others too numerous to mention here are all profiled in great detail in what, I am convinced, will be recognized as the definitive work on the New York Mafia in the years to come.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	I was lucky enough to have picked this book up for only fifteen dollars at a rundown used-book shop on Ann Street in Manhattan's financial district many years ago. It was kept under lock and key in a glass case reserved for books about old New York. "Gang Rule" was written by two veteran newspapermen who had the inside track on the subject matter, the state of organized crime and the corrupt world of local politics that existed in the city and state during the Twenties and Thirties. An entire chapter is devoted to Arthur "Dutch Schultz" Flegenheimer, but there are portraits of others who were equally notorious in the local gangland community as well. The life and career of powerbroker James J. "Jimmy" Hines is profiled in great detail. The Luciano vice trial and his unsavory relationship with Tammany Hall boss Albert Marinelli is touched upon. Of special note, however, is the chapter entitled "A Guidebook to the Rackets," which exposed the Mob's influence over various legitimate industries and which consequently raised costs to the consumer. Pretty insightful reading, even more so because it was published back in 1940. Strongly recommended.
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	0	0	Try as I might, this was one book I simply could not get into. The authors obviously deserve credit for having exhaustively and meticulously researched their material, and they offer an original spin on the motives behind the mass slaughter and the identity of the assassins who committed it. For that alone, there are those who may feel it should rate at least a three-star review. My problem was the writing, which I found so dull and fragmented that I could not in all honesty give it a higher rating than I have. It's hard to believe that this was co-written by the same William J. Helmer who contributed to two of my favorite crime biographies, "Dillinger: The Untold Story" and "Baby Face Nelson."
A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	1	1	I find it somewhat ironic that this "fictionalized" portrait of Jack "Legs" Diamond is far superior to many of the factual biographies of this celebrated mobster which have been published to date. Told in the words of the imaginary Marcus Gorman, an attorney who is seduced by the charismatic gangster and swept into his orbit, "Legs" is probably as close to the truth as we can get. Kennedy's use of dialogue is, in a word, brilliant. I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did, but I found it to be a great read.
A1DF5230T30F79	1	0	I am married to a high school history teacher, for whom I purchased the audio book. One of the primary concerns he has for his students is that they develop critical thinking skills, that they become intellectually mature, able to comprehend and analyze concepts and social issues and their contexts. "Lies My Teacher Told Me" heads in that very direction. This book was fascinating, despite its obvious liberal slant. Despite the fact that my husband and I disagreed with some of his points in the book, he emphasizes some valid and basic problems with the educational system at large. Whether or not you agree with him, it is at the very least an exercise in sociology.
A1DF5230T30F79	0	1	The book is wonderful, like all of Maguire's books, in my opinion. But if you listened to "Wicked" on CD, then you will be very disappointed by Maguire's performance of his sequel. Both novels are very dramatic, full of fantastic, extraordinary characters. And any rendition of them ought to be colorful and highly interpretive. Unlike "Wicked", Maguire's interpretation is bland and predictable, losing the emphasis on both the humor and the horror.Buy the book instead.
A1DFDC8RJCLR77	0	0	Overall the album is listenable however, nothing sticks out, nothing's innovative, nothing is "new" sounding. Most of the tracks sound like they're composed of recycled samples from his previous albums. Most tracks are "downtempo" and could make a good CD to play for background music, but that's about it - nothing memorable.
A1DFDC8RJCLR77	0	1	I made the mistake of ordering this CD. It contains renditions performed on a music box NOT the actual soundtracks.
A1DFFEFWXSXCFJ	1	1	Mine has held up for at least two years and 3 kids. It even seems to give off a tiny bit more heat than in the beginning. I wanted to recommend it as a good gift, put it under your computer desk. Wear socks, motor does strain with pressure, but mine was well worth the going price.
A1DFFEFWXSXCFJ	1	1	I bought this book years ago before it was available on Amazon. So glad to see it's here now and people like it as much as I do. For a very scientific subject, it's a amazingly easy to read, humorous and informative. Now I only wish the people who write books on breeding goldfish could do as well! Thank you, April Kirkendoll!
A1DFFEFWXSXCFJ	0	0	Play Hockey on your knees in your basement? I purchased this item as a birthday present for my son's friend who is 7. I was utterly embarrassed to give it, but I was stuck since I ordered on-line. I thought it was a kid-size hockey set. But no, on the box two kids with sticks, (four players are not shown) are kneeling on a carpet in front of their tiny goals. Do you call that hockey?
A1DFPHI0D2MNRD	1	0	"Can you help me?""Help you! You must help yourself," the dog replied, carefully winding himself with his left hind leg. "I suppose you know why you got stuck.""I guess I just wasn't thinking," said Milo."PRECISELY," shouted the dog as his alarm went off again. "Now you know what you must do.""I'm afraid I don't," admitted Milo, feeling quite stupid."Well," continued the watchdog impatiently, "since you got here by not thinking, it seems reasonable to expect that, in order to get out, you must start thinking."
A1DFPHI0D2MNRD	0	1	This is a book that I really wanted to like. I actually do think the humor is pretty cute and engaging. I have a better understanding of what OOP means thanks to this book. But for actual programming in java? Nope. This book skips over the basics that everyone needs to know just to get a simple program to work in order to focus on the deep concepts and fun things like MIDI beatboxes that you will never get to work.Now, it's not as if I don't know the difference between a for loop and a while loop. I know how to do them in C++, Python and Pascal thanks to books by Gaddis and Savitch. It's just that I have no clue how to implement these basic things *in Java.*Now, the book says that you should have 'some' programming experience and I do. No, you really do need to have a lot of programming experience in Java before this will be of any use. But I think such a person will be looking for a more in depth book.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	0	I received this DVD set for Christmas. At first I thought it was just a cheaply made wrestling video that plagued the scene a few years ago. Man was I wrong! This set is great. But it might not be for the younger fans. The matches shown on this DVD set consist of a time before Vince McMahon attempted to mix MTV with wrestling. Sure you might not get the explosive entrances of today. You do not get the running of the mouth that is overdone each week on both TNA and WWE. You do not get the high flyers, or the grand oversized cages. So what is there that makes this DVD so great? REAL WRESTLING! We all know that most of wrestling is fake, but there was a time when it did appear to be real. In these matches there is blood, there are smaller cages, and something today's wrestling seems to be missing ---- RULES! Today you hardly see a match on television where some wrestler does not take a chair to someones head, or jump off a ladder, or throw someone through a table. But strangely they never appear to get hurt. This is not the case with these classic matches. If a chair is brought in, someone's head will bleed. If someone is jumped by two or three guys, someone will show up and help you out. And when they had a cage match, the cage did not stand three stories off the ground. They were fighting within a small dog kennel, and really getting hurt inside the cage, rather than spending 30 minutes inside a huge cage before they decide to climb to the top of the cage just to throw someone off of it.Here is why older wrestling fans will want this set. There are matches that features Dick The Bruiser, Bob Sweetan, Gino Hernandez, Tully Blanchard, Bruiser Brody, and so many more classic stars. Many never released or discussed in any other DVD set.The only problem I have seen so far with this set is that some matches are joined in progress and some of the editing is done poorly. But considering that when many of these matches were wrestled the only type of VCR on the market was a BETA Max, I am shocked these matches look as good as they do.You can look at other reviews for exact content and other bonus features related to this DVD set but I just wanted to give my 2 cents worth.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	Just looking at the movie poster, I knew this film was supposed to be bad, and I knew I had to see it. Thankfully a friend of mine had recorded it when it aired on SyFy, so I am writing this review based on the videotape I am currently watching. Yes, a videotape. You know those things that you use to stick inside a VCR to watch or record a movie before they made DVDs. I know a few of you might still might might know what these antiques are. Anyways, as a note to those who gave this film 1 star, didn't you know this was a parody?This should have become apparent to anyone within the first 15 minutes of the film when Roger Cormen (yes he is making an appearance in the film) watches a young woman using a metal detector on the beach. The young woman finds a piece of gold, and is quickly attacked by the tentacles of the Sharktopus and eaten. After the young woman is eaten, Roger Corman, walks down to the waters edge and picks up the gold piece the woman has dropped during the attack and walks away with the gold. At no part in this scene does Corman appear to be frightened of what has just transpired in front of him, and even smiles at the camera. So in a sense this film is supposed to be a comedy. It just depends on how you take it.So basically, if you liked the remake of Piranha, you will probably like this movie as well. It has plenty of funny outrageous gags, stupid lines, bikinis, sand, and almost everything that made Piranha great (except no nudity.)Eric Roberts (brother of Julia Roberts) deserves an academy award for his role in this film. After all he was the only person in it that could actually act, and besides he has never won one.Even the editor deserves some kind of award for quickly hiding a machine gun. At one point in the film an ex-soldier fires a machine gun at the Sharktopus to distract it from attacking a news crew. After the fish falls back into the water, the machine gun magically disappears. Amazing! Chris Angel could not have done better.Another great acting scene was done actually by the unknowns in this film. At one point they are chumming the waters in an attempt to attract the Sharktopus. In a nearby area Sharktopus attacks a small sail boat and eats the captain. The captain's wife also falls into the water and it looks like it will be curtains for her. But the Sharktopus lets her go and goes on towards the chummed waters. Those who have chummed the waters think their chumming has attracted the Sharktopus towards them. But considering how skinny the Sailboat Captain's wife was, I think the Sharktopus was just scared it might choke on a bone.Another huge goof, Sharktopus attacks the boat carrying the ex-soldier and the daughter of Eric Roberts (who have been enlisted to capture Sharktopus). In the attack the boats propellers are supposedly damaged and the ship can no longer be driven. However, after a brief phone call to Robert's character, the boat magically becomes drivable again. No repairman needed. At least until they get back to dock, then the boat breaks down again.There are so many great stolen sequences from other Sea Creature movies that I thought the only thing missing was the Shark doing the Land shark routine from SNL. I did not have to wait long before that too came true. Yes reader, this Shark Octopus hybrid can walk on land, wrap itself around tree limbs, and attack anything on land, without the fear of suffocation. Another thing I found amazing was how this creature attacked bungee jumpers and anyone hanging over the water. It was almost like the fisherman for this film was using human beings as fly bait to attract this massive sea creature.Overall I am giving Sharkopus 5 stars because I do not think any other reviewer caught what this film was actually suppose to be. And secondly I thought it was one of the better SyFy films I have seen in a long time. It was even better than Mega shark Vs. the Giant Octopus. Of course that is not saying much, but I can think of more terrible ways to waste my viewing time, such as being forced to watch Leonardo Decrapio in Titanic again. How this film ever made more money than Star Wars is still beyond me, but it happened so now I have to put up with it. And yes Sharktopus was 100 times better than Titanic, of course so was Mega Piranha, Mega Shark Vs The Giant Octopus, ....... I would also say Mega Shark Vs. Crocosaurus, but I have not seen it yet. I will probably in the next hour or two (Thank god for friends with VCRS), just not yet.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	I had only seen a few episodes of M*A*S*H, previously. It was a show that as a family we did not watch, mostly because we did not like the movie. However, when I caught this set on sale for $50.00, I decided I would give it a second chance. I f I did not like it, I could at least get this much back from the DVD set. So far the series has been great. The packaging could have been better. However, considering that each season costs almost $20.00 each and there are 11 here, it is definitely worth the discount to get this edition.I still do not care for the movie but the series has been outstanding. The only problem I have had with this set is some of the DVDs are slightly scratched (But play well). Also I had to return the first box set because not all the DVDs would play. So like I previously stated this set is worth it if you can catch it on sale.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	Although I am starting this review, my son will finish it.What are the good points about this anime -- it makes fun of the entire Full others. Too bad there are not too many others quite like it. So far we have seen gigantic robots that lost their story plot rather quickly or something so full of nudity or barely clothed girls that it made it difficult at best to watch. NOT THIS SET THOUGH.The main characters are ridiculus in a scary movie type of way. Just think of an ex-military guy going to high school without any idea about girls, fun, or anything else us normal people take for granted. In one episode the ex-military guy has rigged explosives to lockers because he knew someone had gotten inside it. Later he discovers that it was just a girl who wrote him a love letter and dropped it off in the vents of his locker.Now if you can handle this type of humor than you will definitely like this show. I have never seen the original Full Metal Panic, but plan on purchasing it after seeing this show. Even if Full Metal Panic winds up being more dramatic than this set, I think it will be still be worth watching, because so far this has been the best anime I have seen.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	Many liberals will probably give this film a bad review because it puts down Michael Moore in the title. But in reality it shows that the events shown in Michael Moore's documentary "Roger and Me" has not effected everyone in the USA. In many states across this country there are still jobs available (some even high paying in their area). Now I know some people may not consider jobs that pay $10.00 an hour as a high paying job, but when you consider that the housing in this area is affordable, Groceries are affordable, and everything else we use in normal life is affordable, it makes a compelling argument.Overall this well made film illustrates why we should take pride in the USA.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	If you are a fan of this film series I would not suggest getting this set (there is a much better set with a little higher quality for salePuppet Master Collection) but if you have never seen the series before, this is a great set. The plot is simple -- master puppeteer Andre Toulon has come up with a serum that makes puppets work with out strings. The Nazi party wants this serum and will do anything to get it -- including Toulon. (at least this is shown in great detail in Puppet Master 3) In Puppet Master 1 we see Toulon's death then it comes to present day and a group of Paranormal researchers are brought to the hotel where Toulon dies in search of what caused the death of a fellow researcher. The Puppets do not realize that the Nazi Party has been eliminated for quite some time and go on a rampage to kill anyone that may be attempting to get hold of the secret that gives the puppets life.A Great scarefest for all. This DVD though has not been digitally remastered to the highest standards (unlikePuppet Master Collection), but the VHS to DVD conversion is not bad. A good find either way.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	0	0	After seeing Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11, I wanted to see something that was giving a different perspective to his claims -- this film was not it. All it is is a series of interviews with Ann Coulter and many other Conservatives. There is no actual evidence shown. If you are looking for films to give an alternate opinion on Michael Moore's work tryMichael Moore Hates Americainstead.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	This was not that bad of a movie at all. Sure you do not see much of Captain Nemo (Played by Patrick Stewart), but the effects were great (for a television movie), and the plot was excellent.I am not sure why so many people gave this movie bad reviews that it did not deserve. It may not have close captioning or any bonus features but the movie itself is great, and definitely worth the low price. Of course I have not seen that many echo Bridge produced DVDs that were not good (Unlike many of the Mill creek products.) And to those who complain about the special effects of these type of movies, why are you complaining? I have seen special effects shots in Buffy The Vampire Slayer that was much worser than anything that these films contain. In the end I would take a chance on any of the films sold by echo Bridge (That is unless they raise the price to $10.00 or more.) Sure they are cheaply made, but in the end many are actually good movies.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	I read a lot of complaints about how bad this movie was. In reality I think the producers of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" are giving it the bad reviews. It has been compared to the remake of this classic and even the producers of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" sue the producers of this film for its comparison. This may be why so many people are giving this film such bad reviews.In reality this movie (in my opinion) is better than the Remake of "The Day the Earth Stood still". C Thomas Howell plays a great part and the effects are not really that bad considering this was suppose to be a B-Movie ripoff. Now a warning to some people who are easily offended -- there is some nudity in this film, but overall it is definitely worth the $6.00 most people are selling it for.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	Basically everybody has given you the basic idea of this film so I will not. But I do want to make one comment about those who claim Michael Moore is a liar. We all know that in recent years the at Michael Moore has attacked the conservative movement and many claim he is a liar because of that. And since that is the case boy am I glad to hear that he is a liar in this film to since he blames the entire situation on both parties. That is right on this film Moore does not take a side. And in all honesty my son did a similar film almost 3 years ago (Before the Bank Bailouts.) Although his mostly did with the way the news media was approaching the subject of Illegal Immigration, he too discovered a link that Michael Moore also stated in this film (The corruption of business started when unknown forces started taking control of the White House towards the end of Jimmy Carter's Term, and the downfall started shortly after Reagan became president.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	While I cannot say I am a true Maiden fan any longer, I really liked this DVD. Seeing Bruce flying the band to each new location, watching Steve Harris autographing pictures on the plane, then seeing the band playing golf or sight seeing, is what makes this band so different. After 30 (god has it been that long) years, they still are only interested in giving their best to their fans. You will not see a bunch of overweight drunken junkies in this film, but a band who somehow has stayed clean throughout their career (same cannot be stated about their original Lead Singer). Well worth the buy even if you are (like me) a larger fan of Maiden's work with Dianno than with Dickinson.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	0	That is correct, I am not a true Marilyn Manson Fan. Portrait of an American Family was about the only MM album I actually liked. The rest spent to much time attempting to make this artist seem weird or maybe was an attempt to appear similar to certain Alice Cooper recordings. When I first saw this DVD, I had accidentally checked it out from the local Library. I do not recall what title I was reaching for but somehow this ended up in my stack. So I got to see this video for free by accident.Although I still thought MM appeared to be a little strange in his on stage activities, he really seemed to get a rise out of the audience, and eventually even had a stagnant rocker like myself enjoying the show. Although it may not have been as grand as seeing Kiss or Alice Cooper -- it did seem to fit into this same catagory. I still think Rob Zombie is a much better artist than MM, but this concert is worth looking into.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	If you purchase one concert DVD or Blu Ray this year, this is the one you need!3 Bands steal this show Anthrax, Metallica and Megadeth. If you are wondering why i am not including Slayer is because the fans did not seem to like them as well, and I was very disappointed that they did not take the stage with Metallica Anthrax and Megadeth to do the song Am I Evil? James Hetfield states that he is bringing out all the bands but it was very clear to me that neither Tom Araya, nor Kerry King were on stage with the other bands. To me this was just disrespectful, so I now have a new reason to dislike Slayer.Okay on to the other 3 acts. Anthrax performs with (original? depends on how familiar you are with the band) lead singer -- Joey Belladonna. Joey does a great job on all the classic Anthrax tracks except "Only". To me that is why Anthrax was a better stage band with John Bush than Joey, but that is just an opinion.Megadeth is next. MINDBLOWING!!!! I have always liked Megadeth, but thought Metallica was a slightly better band; however, after watching both acts, I am not sure who is really better. Both Metallica and Megadeth took to the stage like they owned it. The Bulgaria crowd was even into both bands heavily. I do not think I have ever seen a better performance from Megadeth (and I have seen them a lot.) Plus as an added bonus Unlike Metallica, even the songs I like least by Megadeth sounded great live. If not for the antics of Metallica on stage Megadeth would have been the best band of the concert. To top it all off Megadeth did this during a storm.Slayer I only watched a few minutes of, then placed in the Metallica disc, so I will not rate their performance. If you are a fan of Slayer I am sure you will like them, But the only song I have ever liked by them is "War Ensemble"Metallica is better (in some ways) than they have been in years (because of Bass Player Robert Trujillo), but there is one problem. Being a former Drummer, I could tell Lars was not playing the same Drum kit he had for years. There was certain tones (for lack of a better word) that felt like they were missing or altered. Again that is just one person's perspective. One other thing that I did not care for were the songs "Nothing Else Matters" and "Cyanide" (again that is just a personal preference). I would have preferred to see Lars with a Larger drum kit and performing the song "and Justice For All" in place of the two I disliked.Overall a great concert! Buy it on DVD or Blu Ray because they are only scheduled (so far) to play one date in the USA.

Then I decided once more not to waste my vote since neither McCain's Vice President nor Barrack Obama felt right for the highest office in the land. After seeing this Bio, I think I might have changed my mind sooner. There were alot of things presented in this bio that I did not know McCain had previously done. People can call him a war hero all they want. But he is little better than John Carrey. If I had seen this video sooner, it would not have changed my vote (considering I did not vote) bet it would have my mind up faster.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	For some odd reason (habit maybe) I decided to check out the reviews for this movie. I know I have seen it way over a hundred times, and loved every minute of it. So it surprised me to find some people had given this movie 1 or 2 stars. The 2 star ratings I could understand, because most of these people had obviously seen John Carpenter's The Thing (a loosely remake of the original) but never the film the film that inspired it previously. If I had seen the films in this order I might have given this film a lower rating myself. But that is not the case.This was one of the many B movies I watched when I was young and even one of the first Videotapes / Video Discs (The ancient RCA dual sided discs that came inside a plastic tray.) that I owned. Although Carpenter's Release was somewhere in the early 80's, I do not believe I saw this version until the middle to late 80's so it made little impact to me over this version.Unlike the Carpenter version this Alien does not morph into look alike creatures (Dogs, other humans.) Instead think of it more like a walking Frankenstein (Not really scary, but considered scary during the 30's - early 60's). I cannot recall the Carpenter story as well, but the alien in this film is to show what would have happened if Plant Life (rather than Animal) evolved into human. Also the ending is completely different. Well worth the viewing if you like old B/W B Monster movies.Although I loved the film, I am only giving it 4 stars. To get the full five star it needed to be one of the other true classics from this time period (King Kong, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, etc).
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	1	1	I will keep this short. Just watched this DVD tonight. Overall, I laughed so hard I almost was in tears at times. This is the type of movie you definitely do not want to take too serious. It is a spoof of Horror and Stoner movies. The basic plot of the story is a College slacker orders in the ultimate Bong (Guaranteed to give you the greatest high you have ever experienced). Little does he know that those who used the bong before him had died within a few minutes after smoking. He breaks it out at a party to help a nerdy roommate loose his virginity. then the chaos begins.I will not go any further because the rest will spoil the story. Both movies are definitely worth watching, my son and I laughed all the way through these films. They are not as straight forward as the older Cheech and Chong films (although Tommy Chong makes an appearance in Evil Bong 1), these require the viewer to lose any resistant to the impossible. Probably the best way to explain it, would be to compare it to the fight scene in the Kevin Smith movie "Dogma" between Jay and the "Poop" demon. Also there is something that I am sure will impress the younger males. It is loaded with female nudity. Not that I am all for that, but it was done in a slapstick way throughout most of the movie so those who are repulsed by nudity, will probably look over it. Then again if you are repulsed by nudity, you will probably not have any interest in this film.Overall, fans of Full Moon Films will definitely like this one. It may not be Puppet Master (my favorite of all the Full Moon Production), but it is written by the same person.
A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	0	0	I will not write a very long review since I did not finish watching this program. Basically it is another top 50 WWE events list. I made it through to number 45 before the theme music completely ruined this production. After each event, the them music of about 30+ seconds would start and then another 2 or 3 minute piece of WWE history would start. I think I turned off the program after it showed the Big Show tossing the Undertaker through the WWE ring. Overall, It might have been a good program if the editors had chosen not to over play the theme music throughout the DVD.

If anything goes wrong (and with their cheaply-made phones, something usually does), you'll have to face the nightmare of trying to talk to (or email) their customer service representatives. They are the dumbest, least helpful people on the planet. I believe the hamster I had when I was little had a significantly higher IQ than all the Virgin Mobile employees put together.Virgin Mobile has been charging me for weeks for access to their websites. I've told them five times that I'm not accessing anything (I only use the phone for calls and TM), but every time they get back to me they say: you're accessing them, therefore we are charging them. Maybe gremlins come up while I'm sleeping and listen to MTV on my phone. Or, much more likely, Virgin Mobile is wrongfully charging me money, and no one at the company cares enough (or is intelligent enough) to solve my problem.I'm looking for a new phone, to cancel my account ASAP, but I figured I should warn people to stay away from the lousiest, crappiest phone company in the world: Virgin Mobile.
A1DGKNHNJ8AN4U	1	1	Even the most experienced and jaded police officer encounters a case that manages to get under his skin, and affect him personally. Finding Amy tells the story of one of those cases: the disappearance of 25-year-old Amy St. Laurent, a responsible and lovely girl who went out dancing one Saturday night and never came back home.Loughlin, a veteran of the Portland police department who was in charge of the case, has teamed with Flora, the author of mystery novels, and the result of their joint effort is a well-written book with superb insider access to a riveting case. Finding Amy shows the profound effect that Amy's death had, not only on her family and community, but also on the police department that investigated the case, and many other cases to follow. This is a must-read for any crime buff.
A1DGKNHNJ8AN4U	1	1	There are very few directors as good as Sidney Lumet and there are even fewer writers as good as David Mamet. Throw in Paul Newman and James Mason, in roles that stand out in their outstanding careers, and you understand what makes "The Verdict" such a classic. When it comes to legal thrillers, it doesn't get any better than this.
A1DGKNHNJ8AN4U	1	1	It has very little of the brilliance of the book, but Bright Lights, Big City provides a somewhat entertaining look at the decadent 80s. Most of the merit resides on Michael J. Fox, who manages, against great odds, to make Jamie a relatable character on the verge of self-destruction. Kiefer Sutherland is also great as his sleazy enabler and sidekick. Phoebe Cates, on the other hand, is the movie's worst mistake. She's pretty enough, but not for one second I bought that she was a runway model (how tall is she? Five five?) or, for that matter, that she'd inspire such passion from Fox.
A1DGKNHNJ8AN4U	1	1	The language! The plot! The settings! The cast! Absolutely everything is top-notch in this movie, which manages to bring Oscar Wilde's gem alive -- and sparkling. "The Importance of Being Earnest" is a pleasure to watch.
A1DGKNHNJ8AN4U	1	1	Part of it were difficult to read simply because I hated the author. Stanley Alpert comes across as a self-absorbed jerk who spends much of his book congratulating himself on his achievements, both real (being an assistant US Attorney, managing to survive a harrowing experience) and imaginary (being such a nice human being that God decided to let him live - as if the world weren't full of spectacular people who die early). He's dating a girl, and at the same time he's going out on blind dates and trying to pick up women in the subway. No wonder that, pushing fifty, he's still single.Having said that, if you can get over Alpert's gigantic ego, you'll probably enjoy this book. It tells his experience when he was kidnapped in the West Village, taken to an apartment in Brooklyn, robbed -- and he managed not only to survive but to gather enough information to help the police capture his kidnappers. It's a very good story, told by a very unlikable man.
A1DH3496NU4EKQ	1	0	In less than a minute I was back up and running. The shave was back to being closer than before. I don't know about the claim that it is x% closer shave. I also don't buy the "must change every 6 months" as I hadn't changed my blade in 2 years! The blades are very well made and the old head was shaving fine.
A1DH3496NU4EKQ	1	1	The style of this book makes reading it a joy. If you are a student pilot the insights are great. I am only a student so I can't speak for the mega-hour pilots but as in Sky Diving (which I DO have mega numbers in) you always need to keep learning.
A1DH3496NU4EKQ	1	0	My need to have a brand new DVD left when I first looked at my collection and guess what? They were ALL used DVD. What is ON them and the quality of the DVD matter more than the covers. This DVD was without scratches and that is all that matters.
A1DH3496NU4EKQ	0	0	This seems to be a hit and miss situation. I sent the 6" Christmas plant and it was a hit but these 4" pots arrived as if they had not seen any sunlight for days. One's roots are looking pretty dead.IF you order these, order them for yourself not as a gift as I did. Nothing says "blah" like getting a dying plant in the mail for a birthday present.Hirt's reply was "looks OK to me. Let us know if it dies."
A1DH3496NU4EKQ	1	1	What a refreshing twist. Daddy was a bad man with a conscience. Mommy is in it up to her ears in evil also. Coincides with the new DALLAS TV show, I guess. Nice to have a superhero with no powers but those he gets from practice and hard work.Good arch story.
A1DH5OE5FHZ9LM	0	0	i WAS fan oF thalia since she came out but i gotta say that this album [is bad] im sorry you guys but come on, its boring, superborin' since the day i bought it i've listened just once and i had enough, the songs are boring. all of them sound the same, she thought that STEFANO was gonna help her to have the same hits as paulina did...sorry but she and him picked the wrong songs.P.s. ...this is my personal opinion.Thalia had her fifteen minutes of fame already.
A1DHRFS0EIARKR	1	1	I have to say that it starts off pretty slow and moves steady at first but then bam the story changes things changes and its just a thrilling roller coaster ride.
A1DHRFS0EIARKR	1	1	I had this movie from online a long time ago so I knew what I was getting when I decided to purchase it. However I wasn't expecting the DVD quality to blow away the online versions I had. If you have watched this online or anywhere else you might want to consider getting the DVD.The story is very interesting, its not an action packed horror but a very good solid story with minimal blood and decapitations, characters that all have distinct personalities and bring the school a live. Its an amazing movie that defines my taste for Korean horror.Although I can't choose which of the Whispering Corridors movie is my favorite I do have to say that this one like all of them (excluding 5) is very memorable and will probably have you thinking well after the movie finishes. Its the classic Whispering Corridors story at an all girls school, with solid story, minimal gore and great actors/actresses.
A1DHRFS0EIARKR	1	1	I saw this movie for the very first time about 4-6 years ago on on demand and was hooked on it. Its plot for the most part is very intriguing and unsettling, especially with the ring tone. I don't want to ruin story for anyone but if your first time watching pay attention especially middle to end, its a good surprise.Although I had this movie from other sources the DVD is much better to have, not only is the vid standard dvd res, japanese and english language and subtitles.
A1DHU7KRLFI3FH	1	1	Perfect little addition to your violin (or in my case, viola). I would always get horrible rashes on my neck after practicing, but this solved the problem. It's very comfortable, and it made it much easier for me to hold up my viola.
A1DHU7KRLFI3FH	0	0	Honestly, all I enjoyed from this movie was the gorgeous computer effects with the Transformers....but otherwise, it has a pretty lame plot. I thought I would possibly enjoy the humor in the film, but I felt like the director was forcing too much sexual jokes into the film (which I found to be more annoying than funny). Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out. I pretty much didn't care by the time the final battle came. I was a Transformer fan myself when I was a kid, but man, this movie just killed it.
A1DHU7KRLFI3FH	0	0	***SPOILERSOkay, I feel entitled to be in rant mode because I just bought this book today and was determined to finish it before I went to bed. And for what? A pointless ending. The whole book seemed to be building around the trust between Jonothan and Elain and the end just suddenly sweeps all of the main characters to the side as if they were nothing (by either killing them off or ruining their lives). I mean, I'm glad Calum got his just reward in the end, but I felt like the whole body of the book was just....thrown away.
A1DHU7KRLFI3FH	1	1	I'm 17 so I kind of feel a bit ridiculous about writing this review, but I just want to recommend this book to those out there that enjoy the kind of stories with the "world behind the mirror" type of feel to it. I enjoy artistic, dark, and innocent type things, and I think anyone out there that's the same way will enjoy having this book in his possesion.
A1DHU7KRLFI3FH	1	1	I'm a shy girl myself, so I really felt like I could relate to the main character of the book. I could understand the paranoia she felt, her over-sensitivity of what others thought of her, and her feelings of not fitting in. I believe the major points to the story was was to show how the main character finally gains complete confidence in herself and confidence in her husband's love for her.One of the most memorable quotes is when the main character realizes how foolish her fear of people was:"I wondered how many people there were in the world who suffered, and continued to suffer, because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth."To tell the truth, it was hard for me to get past the first chapter or so, but once you finally get to the main story it becomes much more interesting. Right when I finished the book, I actually went back and read the first chapter and finally understood how it all came together.
A1DHUEFGCA7INU	1	1	We really like this lamp. It's small, it's pretty, and it works. I got it for my wife for Christmas. She's pregnant and will be having a baby in a couple of weeks. It's perfect because now she won't have to find the lightswitch every time she needs to feed the baby. It comes with a bulb and everything. There are 3 brightness settings. The dim is dim enough, and the bright is bright enough. It's just all around a really nice lamp, and a good buy.
A1DHUEFGCA7INU	1	1	Very Boring if you are an adult. I'm not gonna lie. Actually, it's not only boring, but can be quite irritating. Here is the synopsis: Each uppercase and lowercase dances around the screen while a voice repeats over and over what they are in an annoying little voice.But for my 22 month old, it was AMAZING. He watched it every day for a month, and he now knows ALL of his letters, uppercase and lowercase. He even reads them to me upside down. He just turned 25 months old, and we are now working on the sounds each letter makes. I'm on my way to buy Meet the numbers and meet the shapes now. I love how well and quickly my son learns things from these movies!I would recommend this DVD to ANYONE who has a toddler.
A1DHUEFGCA7INU	1	1	Goes well with the DVD. The flaps are fun, but not very sturdy. They've gotten mashed very easily.
A1DHUEFGCA7INU	0	0	After about 2 weeks of use, this swing got weaker and weaker until it wouldn't swing at all, even with brand new batteries. What a waste! It's cute, but worthless. I was upset that I'd spent over $100 on something that stopped working almost immediately.
A1DIJNZCMMO31U	0	0	Please, never buy this movie from anyone at any price! It actually hurt to try and sit through this one. It has to be one of the top 10 worst kung-fu movies ever made. I really should not have given it the one star. This is shameful stuff. And I actually like the main actor in other movies. But this is just nasty. -7 stars.
A1DIJNZCMMO31U	1	1	This joint is cool! I like listening to this album a lot! It is funny! And, it's good hip hop, in a sense. Yes, there is the typical or stereotypical BS about women and money and drug dealing, above the law type crap and your other standards black man beating the system and winning big dream...BUT...the beats are smokin' and the lyrics are fun and sometimes true and insightful, yes, insightful. Really listen sometime. I'm not going to type it all out here for you. But there were a few. Just look at the basic premise, he used to be wack as anyone else in the world, which is likely to be true and now with fame and money, he is well liked by silly women. That's cool stuff in real life. Then, he keeps telling you his name so you can remember him and even gives you his cell phone number. That's NEW stuff for hip hop songs. Ain't nothin' wrong with that. And you SHOULD take it in a fun way. Not everybody is trying to be Rakim or KRS ONE. We need some basic lyrics sometime with a fun spirit to it. No, I don't care for the stereotypical BS, but that's what the man pays Black folks to rap about so perhaps you can't really blame a new artist that much...well, maybe you can but still, it's not really that stupid kid's fault. He's a poor dude from the city and found out how to make some good in his and his family's life. Maybe I'll give him the benefit of the doubt as a person, while still showing my disagreement with his standard hip hop silliness of today. Anyway, I enjoy listening to the music. No, I wouldn't buy it but its cool stuff.K
A1DIPB32XGXCQJ	1	1	Have been using thie Wok for a couple of years now and the SO and I love it. Makes for a very special evening. A++
A1DJ3R1MFDHHLG	1	1	It's funny, I never watch baseball because it puts me to sleep, but I love stuff ABOUT baseball. Well worth buying, especially at this price.
A1DJ3R1MFDHHLG	0	1	They may not have the warm, rich sound quality of the HD-555's, but they are much clearer & more detailed. The problem is with the fit. I understand these are DJ headphones, but these are much tighter (& heavier) than you'd expect. Even at low volumes, using these for as little as 20-30 minutes is enough to give someone a headache. Good sound at a good price; if you have a head the size of a softball, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these.
A1DJ3R1MFDHHLG	1	1	It seems that, like alot of other customers, I've tried both the Porta-Pros & the Sennheiser PX-100's. Overall, the two models are very similar in sound quality & comfort. Still, I would have to give the edge to the Porta-Pros. The Porta-Pros are bit more detailed & have a slightly warmer & richer sound. This should not be much of a surprise since Sennheisers are known for their clear, but "thin", sound. Of course there are better headphones out there, but these are a very good value which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. I can't see how anyone could be disappointed with them. After all, there are reasons why this model hasn't changed since they were introduced in 1984.
A1DJ3R1MFDHHLG	1	1	If there's anything wrong with this player, I can't imagine what it would be: The sound quality is very, very good; I don't think this player would skip if you hit it with a hammer; it handles my CD-R's beautifully; and, unlike another customer, I've found that the battery life is great. Switching from Duracells to the lowest of the three grades of Ever-Ready's, I used the player to burn-in a new pair of earphones. I cranked up the volume, set it to the higher of the two bass-boost settings, and let it run on the repeat mode. Almost a full 24 hours later, it was still going strong. It rarely gets any better.
A1DJ3R1MFDHHLG	1	1	It was a Christmas present for my mother & all I can say is that she almost literally cannot put that book down.
A1DJRIB253T78A	1	1	This was a good movie. I really enjoyed it even though I didn't think I would. Acting was great and it was fun all the way through.
A1DJRIB253T78A	1	1	The BEST one yet! Very very cute and the music was adorable and very modern. I loved it so much I actually had watched it twice. It brought out the child in me.
A1DJRIB253T78A	1	1	This was GREAT! A must see movie that will tug at your heart and lift your hopes in the positive side of mankind.
A1DJRIB253T78A	1	1	Awesome movie and I understood completely that sometimes you have to fight for your right to believe in God no matter how many try to prevent it.
A1DJRIB253T78A	0	0	Absolutely boring for me and was shocked to see Halle Berry play such a role. She's a fine actress.A no brainer no watch for me.
A1DJRIB253T78A	1	1	An excellent movie with lots of action and thrills. Caviezel was superb as usual. I recommend this movie highly as keeping you on the edge of your seat.
A1DJRIB253T78A	0	1	I didn't see too much of Obama in this movie to who the movie thought he was and who he actually is. Obama's America was not told but it's coming and none of us will like it.
A1DK3UW6M5N0YX	1	1	I used this book in highschool. It is one of the best vocabulary books for that age group I have seen. It's very structured and perfect for classroom use although it may take two years to work through. It not only has many words that students should learn, but it also presents them very well and has sections on the roots of words to help students figure out words that they've never seen.I was thoroughly disappointed when my old highschool quit using it after over 20 years of use because of lack of availability. For homeschoolers and educators of all kinds, this book is a must.
A1DK3UW6M5N0YX	1	1	This book is really helpful and entertaining. The author has a humorous style, but addresses the issues well. He also covers a few topics that many study guides don't, such as how to do deal with internal distractions, etc. It's notably a bit dated in some of its comments and illustrations, but the content of the book is timeless. It's well worth any student's time.
A1DK3UW6M5N0YX	0	1	This classic by Sinclair Lewis is set sometime in the early 1900s (1920s ?). It was written to show the shallowness of life of the average, middle-class men of the day in their pursuit for money, popularity, etc.I found this book to be incredibly long and boring, but I think that was part of the point. At any rate, it's a classic, and in the words of a great literary critic, &quot;These works are no longer on trial - the readers are.&quot;
A1DK97G20FAX4O	1	1	The book is fantastic BUT it doesn't have an all encompassing list of mucus causing foods and the internet doesn't help because you get both sides for every food there is. One says it's mucus causing and another says no although thru some research I've found a more encompassing list on the internet of alkaline and acid foods which seems to apply to mucus forming or non-mucus forming foods. In some of the recipes it gives you some food choices and then says etc...like you're supposed to know what the rest of the vegetables are you can substitute. I've eliminated dairy from my diet for about a month and have not had to take any allergy meds (which I took EVERYDAY my whole life) but I still have much mucus. It's aggrevating there's nobody to talk to about this diet or to share experiences with. If you'd like to talk email me: (...)
A1DKJHPG0P17LY	1	1	The book is great.... However, one would think that the printer would check the spelling of his last name on the front cover.... It's "Richthofen" and NOT "Richtofen" as printed.... Will the printer replace the book???Regards,Don_
A1DKJHPG0P17LY	1	1	I purchased Silent Hunter III on DVD several years ago. Lately, I downloaded the GWX-3 extension that are free on the web. All this will run* on Vista 32 bit.1. Review the GWX-3 pdf manual; SHIII must be removed and specific history files (see step 3).2. Download the Patches for SHIII; SH_3_DVD_1.1_us, SH_3_DVD_1.2_us, SH_3_1.3_us, and SH_3_DVD_1.4a_us into a directory C:\SHIII Patches.3. Download GWX3.Zip into a folder C:\GWX3 and expand the files.4. Anything run on Vista MUST be run as administrator (This is important! Right click the mouse button with the pointer on the icon, then select run as admin).5. Install SHIII (run as admin) into a directory C:\SilentHunterIII6. Install all 4 patches sequentially (run as admin).7. Go to C:\windows\system32\drivers and delete the installed StarForce driver from the SHIII installation DVD because this driver is for XP.I believe the driver name is stdrv01.sys. If you boot Vista with this driver installed, then you will get a message that states the driver open failed. The GWX3 manual has a link to download the StarForce drivers for Vista 32 and 63 bit. I have only installed the 32 bit version.8. Expand the StarForce driver sfdrvup.zip into a directory. I used C:\StarForce.9. Copy the new StarForce drivers into the C:\Windows\system32\drivers directory, The file names are: sfdvr01.sys (56 KB), and sfdrv01a.sys (62 KB).10. Run SHIII (as admin) and it should come up in a full screen mode. Once this is successful, now we can install GWX3 so exit SHIII.11. Run GWX3.exe (as admin); this takes awhile to install but is well worth the results. GWX3 will place a new SHIII, JSGME, and GWX 3.0 manual icon on your desktop (be sure to delete the original SHIII icon).12. Double click on the JSGME icon and it will bring up an install list of 18 0ptions to activate in SHIII ( they can be deactivated as well). I activated GWX -Main movie -Das Boot, GWX -16km Atmosphere, and GWX - Enhanced Damage Effects. Then CLOSE the application.Now, you can run SHIII with GWX 3.0 (run as admin)....Regards,Don_
A1DKJHPG0P17LY	1	1	The book was well conceived and brings to light the lives of several lesser known U-Boat Commanders who served in World War II. Most have not receive a great deal of historical exposure considering their contributions to the German war effort. It's interesting to note that Erich Topp considered Engelbert Endrass his very best friend and this can be sensed in his description of his loss. Erich Topp's lost his friend on 21 December 1941 and this seems to have followed him to his grave on 26 December 2005 many years after the end of World War II.Theodore P. Savas is the managing editor for the book and contributing writers are:In Memoriam Engelbert Endrass: Castor Mourns Pollox by Erich ToppKarl-Friedrich Merten and the Prussian Tradition by Timothy P MulliganRalph Kapitsky: Battle in the Caribbean and the Death of U-615 by Gaylord T.

A1DKJHPG0P17LY	0	0	Why on earth would Amazon sell a Region/2 disk in the US. This disk will require a multi regional Blu Ray Player: not the average player sold in US retail stores.Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Do you see "North America" anywhere in this listing??? This disk would have to be listed as an ABC disk (or A, not B) to play in the US!Regards,Don_Brian Booth Says:The seller is "Region-free titles" and it is a 2010 release from "Optimum Home Releasing". If you search for Red Sonja on Blu-ray.com, you'll see the product made by Optimum is marked as region free. I'm thinking it's probably just a mistake in the description here on Amazon made because Optimum is based in the UK. I'll order one to make sure though.EDIT: Okay, the disc cover actually says Region B, but it plays fine on my Region A player and I just finished the movie. If you watch the film and want to leave your rating at 1 star, I certainly wont blame you as the movie was pretty lame. But please don't rate it as one star because you 'think' it won't play on your player. As much as I dislike the film, what you are doing is pretty unfair.
A1DKJHPG0P17LY	1	1	"A Christmas Story" takes me back to when I was a young boy. We walked to Central Grade School in several feet of snow in the winter. There were no school busses to keep us warm and toasty. Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block. A Christmas gift of a Daisy air rifle was a boy's passage to becoming a responsible young man. We didn't shoot at one another or damage anybody's property because we knew when we went home that evening the "Old Man" would find out from a neighbor. Then I would certainly get a spanking and would loose my privilege of playing with my shiny new Daisy air rifle. This time in Americana was the best time for children to learn and live the values which produced the "Greatest Generation" who built the American dream. The neighborhoods were safe for children to play outside and have snowball battles and sled ride down "Suicide Hill." The modern world with both parents working and children being housed in daycare, or raised by a village, has created a tear in the fabric of the family. I really feel sorry for the children of today because they have not lived "A Christmas Story." That's such a shame....Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.Kind regards,Don_
A1DKQ4YEKJEXYP	1	1	A nice, interesting film. Story holds your interest. Shirley Temple fans will enjoy her personality in this film.
A1DKQ4YEKJEXYP	1	1	This movie has a good dance sequence with Shirley and Buddy Ebsen. Shirley sings some good songs with friends. An uplifting and entertaining film.
A1DL9HNN769VGI	1	1	Bought this for my daughter this Christmas and she is thrilled. I paid half the price I would have if I had bought it at my local drug store.
A1DL9HNN769VGI	1	1	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has been using it for years and loves it. I loved the price and service.
A1DL9HNN769VGI	1	1	Great deal for the money! I bought it to chop nuts and have since started to use it to chop veggies. It works great!
A1DLDE2PXFJ0ZS	1	0	I bought these headphones about 10 years ago, and they have come in quite handy. I really have never like earbuds as they come out of my ears too easily. These headphones stay on my head even during vigorous activity.Sound quality is above average, but bass response is average. You simply will not get the same thumping bass as a good pair of earbuds.The only other con is that the headphone cable is a bit on the short side.However, for something cheap that you can abuse and depend on for years, it works very well.
A1DLDE2PXFJ0ZS	1	0	I use this product on steel items dipped in phosphoric acid. Spraying on without primer results in an impressively tough finish.What makes this finish so tough is that you can lay it on thick - even to the point of running - and it will dry hard as a rock.Other spray paints, when applied too thickly, will never dry.-----------Note: Some people have written in their review that the paint does not leave a hammered finish. You MUST spray multiple coats and lay the paint on thickly otherwise it will not leave a hammered finish. If you spray the paint on too lightly to try and save paint, the finish will be the color you expect, but NOT a hammered finish.
A1DLDEEET29J0M	0	0	This DVD purports to contain both a documtary of sorts along with a concert performance of Pavarotti, however fails to deliver on either. The first 15 tracks contain quasi-interviews of Mr. Pavarotti, at various locales, however are hampered by being dubbed into English over Pavarotti's comments in Italian.Worse, both the documentary and concert sections of this DVD are horribly edited. This is particularly annoying in the concert selections, as the film jumps, in the middle of arias, from Pavarotti singing in concert to the sappiest panoramas of beach scenes and the like. One might as well just listen to a concert CD and avoid being distracted by the kitchy attempts at artistic editing.
A1DLDEEET29J0M	0	0	This film does not work on any level. The acting is, at best, adequate. However, Fanny Ardant fails entirely to capture Callas' studied refinement and, when attempting to show Callas as carried away with the music, Ardant appears more drunk or stoned than concentrated. And, this is to say nothing of her senseless and distracting accent.Jeremy Iron's character of the impressario is a cliche of a homosexual. And this is to say nothing of his senseless and distracting pony-tail. Joan Plowright's character is just unnecessary to the film.The musical sequences are the only somewhat redeeming aspects of this otherwise tedious two hour affair. The rest of the film is just sloppy: the clothing is not in keeping with the 1977 setting; the Mercedes which chauffers Callas through town is a 1980's model; the operatic scenes are truncated, such as the end of Act II from Tosca, from which quite a few lines of music are eliminated; even the "Japan" concert to which the film refers many times was actually a London concert.Zeffirelli claims the film to be in honor of his "friend" Callas. Sadly, it operates as an insult to her dignity and artistry.
A1DLDEEET29J0M	1	1	Several reviewers have argued about the sound quality of this concert CD. Overall the quality is extraordinary (and rivals many studio recordings). The exception to this is in two arias (Come Scoglio and the Don Carlos aria), where the sound goes back and forth from being somewhat muffled.Nonetheless, do not let that deter you from purchasing this CD. Price could not have been in better form, and there are few artists of record who sound as good, even in studio recordings, as Price in this superb selection of arias.
A1DLDEEET29J0M	1	0	Note that individuals such as John R. Linnell submit asinine ravings about politics, but do not review the text at hand. One wonders if they even read the book or (as is the habit of most alleged "conservatives") passed a knee-jerk judgment without the benefit of seeking any information on the subject being judged.
A1DLDEEET29J0M	1	1	Throughout her career, Price had an almost intimate relationship with much of Verdi's work. Frequently, in her later concert performances (some of which are available on CD and DVD), she demonstrated a certain hurried sloppiness, with swooping notes and an unbalanced middle range. This CD, however, is Price at her mature best. She displays extraordinary care in her overall technique, and demonstrates overwhelming legato as opposed to careless sweeping through notes. Overall, this is a must own CD for Price and Verdi lovers, as well as being a wonderful example of a perfect Verdian at her prime for an operatic neophyte. The only reservation is with the tempi of Zubin Metha: although the Israel Philharmonic provides a magnificent, well toned and orderly handling of Verdi's scores, Metha is a bit erratic in his conducting. Nonetheless, this recording proves Price to be the ultimate combination of extraordinary technique with artistic expression. One cannot ask for or even imagine better.
A1DLQ7V643H4AH	1	1	If you want your children to relax and simply be the kids they are, this is your book. Readers of "Hollywood's in My Hamper" will learn to identify senseless peer pressure and avoid the pop culture trap. Debrecht's book illustrates to kids why it is better to set goals and work hard rather than to waste money trying to be cool.But that's not all. This book is one of the best ways to teach your children to never trust Hollywood or any of its hypocritical multimillionaires. Whether they are peddling their fashions, sexual dalliances, Marxist anti-Americanism, or mind-numbed stupidity, Hollywood stars are dangerous and should never be trusted. Not a word they utter should be received uncritically. Their mass-media brainwashing techniques should be carefully screened and their ideologies rejected. Kids today need good friends and faithful families -- not Britney Spears and George Clooney.So be sure to get this book for your kids and for your public library. "Hamper" may just be the best cultural-awareness book on the market for children. Your kids will love it.
A1DLQ7V643H4AH	0	0	Theatrical to a fault. Painfully cold, distant, and tedious. In nearly every scene, Jesus is portrayed as a robotic zombie hopelessly lost in a stare. Christ's stilted speech patterns are quirky and uncomfortable. Absurdly melodramatic. It all comes off as creepy, weird, and without any humanity. My children hated it and came away disliking Jesus Christ and most of the characters. I regretted having them watch it. Perhaps good for some adults, but your teen and tween children will be baffled and perplexed about why this guy is worshipped and adored by billions.Stick to the bible or else try The Jesus Film or The Greatest Story Ever Told.
A1DLQPYS0XZ376	0	0	I bought the Goonies / Gremlins / Gremlins 2 combo. I got very tired of listening to the boys yelling and screaming from start to end. Many scenes dragged along too long. I had to fast forward to alleviate the annoyance. I do not understand the 4 1/2 rating. Don't waste your money and time.
A1DLUJNJCBM9D1	1	1	We Were Soldiers is by far the best movie I've seen in some time. Mel Gibson really showed his ability to command a movie dispite having a very good supporting cast. I watched the movie three times and had only had two days. Simply EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!
A1DM5TPGJQXRZS	1	1	The remarkable combination of Indian content and reggae style works beautifully, especially in the extremely catchy &quot;Tribute,&quot; &quot;Tohono O'odham People,&quot; and the title cut. Their other CD &quot;Rain Us Love&quot; won a NAMMY (Native American music award) in '02. Good music, good message, fun listen.
A1DM5TPGJQXRZS	0	0	by Yahya Sulaiman, The Logic Hammer. (I am not Richard Livingston but his son, despite what it may say above.)When I was a Christian I was much inspired by C.S. Lewis's theology. I tore into it greedily, and the book "Mere Christianity" in particular helped me when I had lapses of faith. This is not unusual: there is no theological work of his--indeed, perhaps no book of Christian theology by *anyone*--which is as renowned for inspiring or increasing Christian faith. Now, rereading the book as a Muslim, I am a little ashamed that I was ever misled by such sloppy arguments for Christian belief as book provides.On page 75 C.S. Lewis "[henceforth] assumes the Christian point of view, and looks at the whole picture as it will be if Christianity is true". Everything up to that point is his attempt "to explain and defend the belief [system] that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times" (page VIII). This review will focus only on the former part of the book. Not being a Christian I am no longer interested in matters addressed only to Christians, and it is in that first seventy-five pages where the missionary crux of the text lies.The structure of the book's argumentation is progressive. Somewhat like the book I'm writing to promote Islam it starts with the issue of God's existence, then discusses theories about God and characteristics attributed to Him; then it's on to the issue of religion. Unlike me, Lewis decides to do almost all of the task in the form of a single process of elimination, going through other worldviews bit by bit until Christianity is left as the only possibility. It is in this structure that the book makes its jaw-dropping fatal mistakes. The whole process of elimination, after starting off well, becomes nothing more than a progressively huger and more blatant series of false dilemmas. Where he might say that A and B are the only possible options he leaves out a very real C and D: then he may allege that 1, 2, and 3 are the only possibilities and that by eliminating 1 and 2 he has proven 3, when in fact the number of possibilities may range well into the hundreds.Like I said, at the start Lewis's argumentation is at least generally sound. He certainly makes the first few chapters a worthy read by putting forth persuasively the Argument from Morality for God's Existence and competently refuting the common rebuttals by nontheists: absolute relativism, the "natural/herd instinct" appeal, the claims of morality being purely a matter of social convention, education, or semantics. Then Lewis starts to narrow down the issue of what to believe of this higher moral lawgiver. He talks about how all of us have defied our inner moral law and thus put ourselves wrong with the Power behind it. Most of all this is, so far as I can see, free of fallacy, though even here Lewis makes some embarrassing false bifurcations: automatically equating religion with theism, nonreligion with atheism, and hard materialism with atheism. Also, I'm not sure but I don't think that part of the definition of pantheism is belief that God is beyond good and evil, although one could argue that it might entail that.Lewis next moves onto an even bigger and more egregious false dilemma. He claims that the only three possible worldviews in existence are religion (again, he uses "religion" interchangeably with "theism"), hard materialism, and the belief in that ill-defined "life force" of Creative Evolutionists. Where does Buddhism fall into these three categories? Buddhists believe in the existence of immaterial realms but not in theism and certainly not in the "life-force" of Creative Evolutionists. In which of Lewis's three categories are we to place Taoists? What about agnostics? The issue of God's existence *is* well covered, as I've said, by Lewis's presentation and defenses of the Moral Argument but the fact remains that agnosticism still doesn't fit into the religion/hard materialism/Creative Evolution trifurcation. Nor does deism, technically speaking. And there's even more where all that came from.But that false dilemma is *nothing* compared to the one that follows: "There are only two views that face all the facts. One is the Christian view that this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been. The other is the view called Dualism" (page 42).Wow.I don't think I could ever *count* how many excluded middles are left out of that! Islam is only one of maybe thousands. Technically speaking, one doesn't even have to subscribe to *any* religion at all in order to believe that this is a good world that's gone wrong yet retains the memory of what it ought to have been. Many fanatically irreligious atheists believe that at least as firmly as your average Christian. Even if you add the part about there being a universal moral lawgiver whom we have all defied, how are Islam or Judaism automatically excluded, leaving Dualism as the sole alternative left to Christianity? Did Lewis not know that we believe that too? The Christian scriptures themselves quote Old Testament texts--Judaism, in other words--to establish the doctrine: Romans 3:10-12 is citing Psalms 53:3 (and maybe also Psalms 14:3). The Koran says that morality is a sign from God (surah 30, verse 21) and that we have all violated it to the point where if God took us to task for it He would destroy all of us (surah 16, verse 61). It agrees that because of what happened in Eden the world has gone wrong yet traces of good--embellishments of this world and potential mercy from God--remain (surah 7, verses 19-32). Yet the one and only mention of our religion in the whole text of "Mere Christianity" is a little snippet on page 78 about how it is not Christianity but Islam that is a teetotal religion.Did Lewis ever even *consider* Islam? His autobiography "Surprised by Joy" is of no help. Islam isn't even brought up there either, even though it says that what got Lewis started considering, after he had changed his mind about being an atheist, whether any religions were true was when he began to wonder if any religion was a final consummation of all previous true religion. He arrived at the conclusion that there is such a religion and that it is Christianity. He gives no evidence that the subject of whether or not that religion is Islam ever even crossed his mind, even though Islam makes more of a point than any other religion in the history of the world of alleging to be such a consummation of previous religion. I've read pretty much almost every theological writing Lewis has ever written and with the exception of that incidental fleeting mention of Islam as a teetotal religion of page 78 of "Mere Christianity" the only thing about Islam from Lewis I can ever remember reading was his claim that that if you went up to Muhammad (on whom be peace) and asked him if he was Allah, "he would have rent his clothes and cut your head off". With such shameful ignorance as that perhaps it's not surprising he had little to say of my religion.And so it is with this step in Lewis's process of elimination--leaving out Islam, Judaism, and innumerable other excluded middles--that the whole thing goes awry, preventing any following steps in the process from working since they're all proceeding from this false and presumptuous premise. That's the risk you take when you're forming a process of elimination. It's like a game of Jenga: if one piece doesn't fit or is left out then everything above it comes tumbling down. As Lewis himself notes, "progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer" (page 28). This review could almost end right here. But the process of elimination isn't *quite* the only argumentation for Christianity which Lewis employs. Perhaps he continues because he himself wasn't completely confident of that absurd bifurcation. In any case he still hasn't yet arrived at his final conclusion on pages 61-62 that "[therefore] I have to believe that Jesus was (and is) God". His last few arguments focus on establishing the specific central doctrines of Christianity.If you thought that no false dilemma could top the Christianity/Dualism one, you were wrong. Throughout the home stretch Lewis's arguments for Christianity are all built, blindly, without justification or even any mention of possible disagreeing viewpoints, on the assumption that all biblical texts he uses--including all of the text of all four Gospels--are necessarily accurate. He points to this and that and the other from the Gospels, and says there, don't you see now? He poses his famous Trilemma ("lord, lunatic, or liar" etc.), which I soundly refuted at [...]. He takes it for granted that the Bible is right about God having chosen the Jews and so forth. He assumes that all the words the Gospels attributed to Jesus (on whom be peace) are accurate recordings of what he said. He does not devote one penstroke to argumentation for the accuracy or authenticity of any of the texts in question. And because of the alleged implications he finds in his biblical references Christianity must be true. In other words, he essentially tells us to believe the Bible because the Bible says to. Terms like "circular argumentation" and "begging the question" don't even *begin* to do the situation justice. Would he have been convinced if I had pointed to texts about Muhammad (on whom be peace) in the Koran as evidence that he must be God's final prophet and messenger?To be sure, there is one other argument for Christianity that Lewis makes. He says that "one of the reasons he believes Christianity" is that "it is a religion you could not have guessed. If it offered us just the kind of universe we had always expected I should feel we were making it up. But in fact, it is not the sort of thing anyone would have made up. It has just that queer twist about it that real things have" (pages 41-42). How many religions *don't* offer people something contrary to the kind of universe they had previously expected? And why can't there be nonreligious or even irreligious viewpoints which do the same thing too? *Why* isn't Christianity the sort of thing that anyone would have made up? People could make up anything. Doesn't scientology alone prove that there's nothing on earth that people might not have made up? Exactly what does "a queer twist" even mean anyway?So there you have it: this is what we get from world's seemingly most oft toted evangelistic tract. This is the best the finest Christian apologist and theologian the world has ever seen can do. Now does that prove that Christianity is untrue? Not at all. One certainly shouldn't reject a religion just because a single person, however relatively skilled at the task compared to most of his kind, failed miserably to argue persuasively for it. Nor does any of this mean that Islam *is* true. That is another subject for other articles, many of which I have already written. Not to worry: as Lewis himself remarks on page 32, "If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end." Indeed, and you may even--God grant it--find truth. But for the reasons I've stated you certainly won't find it in "Mere Christianity"--certainly not very far into the text after the issue of God's existence has come and gone, anyway. May God bless us all and guide us to a right path.
A1DM7WH33VWRX5	1	1	The base for the inflatable Rody horse was a bit bigger and bulkier than I had expected. Very light though and good if your child does in fact prefer to make Rody a rocking horse. My 2 year old nephew was a bit too small to sit steadily on the horse while it was in its base. He preferred to bounce on the rubber Rody instead. Once he gets bigger though, the rocking movement might work better with him. One warning - there are no footrests. I wouldn't say this base is essential, but if the child is big (3+) they may enjoy it.
A1DM7WH33VWRX5	1	1	My 2 year old nephew is a bit small for his age and so was not super steady on the Rody, but loved it nevertheless. He has cerebral palsy and the horse is supposed to be good for developing core strength - I can see that happening. We have to help him bounce on it by pulling on the tail. The ears make good handles for little hands.
A1DM7WH33VWRX5	1	1	I'd already tried these gloves from a friend, so I know they're great. They work excellently if you want to use them during exercise - I used them for yoga and the pain in my wrists just disappeared. My yoga teacher said a year of using them could correct the posture and then I wouldn't need to wear them again. We'll see, but meanwhile, they really help. They are flexible, with a small plastic strip inside which can be replaced (they send a couple of replacements with the gloves).
A1DMK8K0ISV93P	1	1	With tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins this movie is a work of art that leaves you warm inside. A must own for any respectable collection. Based on 80,000+ votes on IMDB this movie is rated second only to The Godfather, as the best movie of all time.
A1DMK8K0ISV93P	1	1	Another great film in the list of good Brad Pitt movies. He made a great career change starting with Seven and has yet to dissapoint. Norton also gives a great performance, which is par for the course with him. Kinda dark and violent, only a good date movie if your girlfriend is into S&amp;M.
A1DMK8K0ISV93P	1	1	I don't think there is a movie that has more social commentary about current American Culture than this movie. It addresses so many of the vain things we do in our daily lives as well as addressing the larger picture of life and its frailty. With excellent performances from all characters especially Spacey, this movie is a must own for any respectable DVD collection.
A1DMP2VNV9YNYF	0	0	I liked the early Kay Scarpetta novels for the forensic science, but the real "victim" in every novel is Kay Scarpetta (Cornwell's alter ego) herself. Her career is in jeopardy, her credibility, her niece's life, her own life...The poor ripped-up murder victims are as nothing to Scarpetta's problems.Typically, "Portrait of a Killer" begins with the angst of its author. "It has always been easier for me to get angry than to show fear or loss, and I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert." A simple invitation to visit Scotland Yard is fraught with moral ramifications: "It would have been a betrayal of what I am and an insult to Scotland Yard and every law enforcer in Christendom for me to be 'tired' the day Linda Fairstein said she could arrange a tour." Her self-absorption is almost comical.Cornwell makes no argument that comes close to justifying her conviction that Sickert was the Ripper. She seems to have formed her opinion of Sickert's guilt based on his art ("I saw evil"), then examined his life for facts to justify that opinion. Her presentation is poor: Facts about the murders, cultural history of the Victorian era, art criticism, and descriptions of modern forensic science are presented in a random jumble. Her own assumptions contradict themselves; after telling us that Sickert preferred his victims ugly and deformed, she offers no word of explanation as to why the Ripper's most grisly murder was of the young attractive Mary Kelly.I have no theory as to who the Ripper was; he may even have been Walter Sickert, but certainly not based on this compilation of "evidence"!
A1DMP2VNV9YNYF	1	1	It's difficult to convey the richness of this book, which consists of layer upon layer of stories. There's the story of how one particular Jewish family perished during the Holocaust, and the story of their descendant's search for information not only about their deaths but about their lives. It's about the difficulty of learning "the truth" about anyone, even without the barrier of years. If we were to disappear tomorrow, how would our friends and neighbors describe us? This difficulty of knowing makes it all the more riveting when Mendelsohn stands at the spot where two members of the family died. They are in the past--we will never learn more about them than we know right now--but they were real, and they died HERE.Most poignant to me was the testimony of the survivors from whom Mendelsohn gathered the facts about his family. These people outlived not only their families but their friends, their neighbors, their town, and their entire culture. It's as if they had been set down on an alien planet.
A1DMP2VNV9YNYF	1	1	The "Product Description" is inaccurate--Prince Amerigo had NOT had an affair with Charlotte Stant, but had merely come close to it. It makes a difference.
A1DMQXF3YATFDB	0	1	Anthony Hopkins, whom I admire greatly,should hve been billed as making a "guest appearance." He is always outstanding, but billing him as "starring" in this with Ms. Paltrow is deceptive advertising at best. Go back and check oout his TV murder mystery with Blythe Danner "Guilty Conscience"--the man has staying power. Better still, go back to "The Lion in Winter"--Hopkins & O'Toole!!!!
A1DMQXF3YATFDB	1	1	It is a great shame this film is not available in U.S. format. I saw it years ago in a theater--with subtitles. If you have a heart, this film can break it. The soundtrack adds greatly to the experience;probably the best ever use of "Love Hurts" (Everly Bros.) as part of the soundtrack.
A1DMSO5POBN1U3	0	0	I didnt like this book at all if I compare the other books that Clive Cussler has written. It is a lack of adventure.I can easily say that this is Clive Cussler's worst book
A1DMSO5POBN1U3	1	1	Yasar Kemal is one of the best Turkish novel writers. Perhaps he is the most known writer around Europe as a Turkish writer. Anatolian Tales is Yasar Kemal's one of the best books. In this book there are three stories which are written in an interesting way.These three stories passes around the main land of Turkey in Anatolia. They are tales. There are some writings explaining the tradition in the time of Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. I think this book is a &quot;must read&quot; for Turkish people and all others who are interested in beautiful lands of Anatolia...
A1DMSO5POBN1U3	1	1	The book is originally called &quot;Ince Memed&quot;. It's Yasar Kemal's most famous and the best novel that I have ever read. It is an adventure type novel and tells the story about a boy called Memed and his life from as a child to teenager and to much older days. Memed lives in south of Turkey in a mountain village. Life standarts are very low and people are not happy because there is a very old system. Villages are controlled by wealthy men who are called as &quot;Aga&quot; in Turkish. In this story Memed gives a war against the Aga of his village and his own life. This is another &quot;must read&quot; book from Yasar Kemal and explains the humanity really well. I can surely say that this the best book I have ever read.
A1DMT0Z4ZS16N3	0	0	I have had the Western Digital External Hard Drive sitting on my shelf for almost three years. It's main purpose is to store backup data from my desktop, in the event the desktop hard drive fails.Of course, The Western Digital hard drive fails and WD does not want to know me now, when their product fails. They say they cannot repair it, won't cover it under any warranty, since the warranty expired six months ago and to stop calling them!I did not expect their product to fail as soon as the warranty was up.This is the reason that I will purchase a SEAGATE external hard drive. They have a (5) FIVE year warranty on their products. If I had purchased a SEAGATE hard drive, I would not be writing this sad story.At least the data stored in my old Dell will not be lost and I can copy it to the new hard drive that I will purchase.It looks like my old Dell hard drive will be saving me from losing my data, stored on the new Western Digital back up hard drive!A storage device that is unreliable, is useless.You have been Warned!
A1DMT0Z4ZS16N3	1	1	I purchased this combo smoke/carbon monoxide detector in 2001 to replace my hard wired smoke detector. It has hung on my wall near my furnace room for over 7 years. I received an "error chirp" last night so I am in the process of replacing the unit. This unit has lasted 7 years and of course, I wish it had lasted 10 years. In the 7 years, it went off about ten times when the house filled with kitchen smoke. The carbon monoxide detector activated once, when my furnace malfunctioned. I never had a fire.I was suprised to hear some of the complaints of others about the unit malfunctioning. The best thing to do is return it right away! If you are lucky to get a good one, you won't be sorry.
A1DMT0Z4ZS16N3	1	1	Purchased this lanyard for my Sandisk USB flashdrive. The strap is an all black braided "rope" design with an attached, quick disconnect portion for the USB drive. This plastic clip acts as a safety device that will allow the USB to physically disengage if it becomes entangled.At $8 plus shipping, I find it to be a bit expensive for it's function, but I am unable to find it in my local computer store. I purchased two lanyard and expect that they will last a long time. This item did not receive five stars because it is pricy for it's function, but well made.***** I finally found these Lanyard for $2.00 in August, at a local Ipod accessories store.****
A1DMT0Z4ZS16N3	0	1	I purchased this item so I can listen to music, during the Spring and Summer, in my back yard. I have owned DeWalt products and have always been satisfied with their performance. Let me state that the radio tuner in this unit is crap! It fades in and out of the tuned frequency. The Knob feels loose. The power drains from my Dewalt 18 volt battery even when the radio is not being used. I have to freshly charge the NiCad to keep it playing for the whole day.The unit works well with my MP3player and it is well constructed. But Again, the radio is Crap!

The construction is not as good as when they were made in America, Europe or South America. The shoes squeak as you walk. The man made sole cannot handle New York sidewalks. They have begun to show rapid wear already. I do not expect to last as long my previous pairs of Bostonian shoes. I am sorry to say that I will have to switch to another brand in the future.
A1DMT0Z4ZS16N3	0	1	I have owned Bostonian shoes for a number of years. Recently I purchased two pairs, one in Black and one in burgandy. The quality appears to be the same except that the shoes now has man made soles. This was not a big problem for me except that now the shoes squeak when I walk. I don't know if the problem is due to the fact that the soles are man made or that the shoes are now made in CHINA. These will be my last pair of Bostonians.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	0	0	If you're considering this movie i'm going to save you some time, it's crap. However cheap it is just put your money in your pocket and reverse it. It's a rip off of a few other movies with the same plot, but those were better written and acted.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	1	1	I kind of liked this movie because of the lesson that it taught. The movie was essentially about two girls one of which had one good friend that everyone thought was here boyfriend but she just saw as a friend. The other girl had several friends but liked things to be her way so she was also kind of a bully. Throughout the course of the movie one of the characters develops a good friendship with the new girl in town. It was well acted and sends the message of acceptance.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	0	0	This movie was one of the worst movies that i've ever had the misfortune of seeing. What makes it worse is the fact that i paid for it. The acting stunk and all around it just gives horror movies a bad name. Save your money.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	1	1	Both of these movies were good. It was well acted and fun for all ages.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	1	1	I liked this movie and didn't care that i spent my money on it. It was well written and well acted and you could follow it even if you don't speak spanish.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	0	0	Don't buy this movie even if you have kids. The main reason is that this movie should have been the first one and the first one should have been the second one. It also was pretty poorly acted.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	1	1	This series is very good so the feature films weren't bad either. The two for the price of one deal is well worth it too. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under the age of thirteen though it can be very graphic.
A1DMYZNV4OW9EQ	1	1	I love the UFC becasue it's close as hell to real combat. This show gives people a glance into the training required to be a really good fighter. You get pointers from the greatest fighters in UFC history so all and all it's worth watching to improve your fighting style.
A1DN616WGFTW2G	1	1	My Aunt Got this and I inherited with the house. As one person noted, moving it is not an option. My Aunt got someone to put the shelves in, wooden with the notches on the back corners to fit. Then, the same guy used steel screws to secure the roof to the sides so it wouldn't blow off. I wish I could get this for the original price of about $200! I'm looking at another one as I must get a lawnmower now--the yard service we have as part of our homeowners association fee gets us a crappy cutting service, but for $25 each month, I'm not going to complain about it too much. Anyhow, I've outgrown the other one, and need to get another one on board in the next six months. I recommend it, with the caveats that everyone who posted prior to me have noted.Linda11 September 2012I did get a second one. Went together super easy. Love it. The shelves didn't need notching for this one. I also didn't screw anything of it together. Still holding very well!--
A1DN616WGFTW2G	1	1	This is a fun and light movie. Fun romance. Evil fun courtesy of Ms. Weaver! This is the first movie I downloaded to my HD Kindle. Worked out very well on the new Kindle.
A1DN616WGFTW2G	1	1	I've owned this brush since 2003. It's now December of 2012. I washed and cared for this brush carefully over the years. Until yesterday, a simple wash in soapy water would make the brush come back to its original condition. Now, I see that the bristles are taking on some wear and tear. Not only that, and this is all about me, sometimes, I have not cooled down enough from my workout and shower and when I apply the foundation, it seriously clumps to the bristles. Sigh. I had to get out a stronger grease cutting detergent for that. So, now I am back in the market for this brush-ok, it should have been replace a year ago. I do have one brush on hand from another kit that I purchased, I just hate to break up the kit! Overall, the brushes that I have from Bare Escentuals have had a long and productive life with me. The other brush that I've had since 2003, the double end eye-shadow / eyeliner brush is getting to the replacement point as well. Overall, it's best not to over load the brush OR your face with too much powder--if you want to look flawless.I know that there are complaints here and the the BE site on how this brush sheds. Honestly, they must have done something as a cheaper solution in the past few years, or reviewers are really using this brush harshly. I'd bet on the former though, and having said that, if one is not happy with their brush, they should not only post, but call BE and talk with customer service.

That is not what this one was made for.I bought it for my girlfriend so she could work around the yard without messing with a gas one and she loves it. The oiler doesn't work real well and make sure u have FULL charges on ur batteries before u start a project. I bought an extra chain for mine and have one getting sharpened by a buddy of mine while I use the other. All in all a good purchase with a few minor setbacks. ;-)

A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	What a group of despicable people. Usually, in a TC book, you can find one hero that emerges. Someone who you put your hope in that will save the day. There is no one like that in this story. First, each and every adult in young Larry Swartz's life was a failure. From his worthless young mother who abandoned him after pretending to have an interest in him for a few years, to each dysfunctional foster family who tried to make him fit in their families with no success. The poor child was never loved by anyone. He had six mothers in six years. Finally, he is adopted by what would be an outwardly "good" family. However, the Swartzs are a puzzle. What kind of people were they really? They had outwardly successful jobs but a trashy dirty house. They are portrayed to have been cruel with their three adopted children and seemed cold and hostile to each other. Why did these five people even come together and try to form a family? The portraits of them together belong on the awkwardfamilyphotos.com website. Still, you never really find out what drove a 17 year old to slay both his parents in such a radical fashion. To chase his mother around the neighborhood in the snow nude? That is beyond rage. This book left me feeling empty and sad.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	Okay, I am not an idiot. I can read and understand a book. I do ER billing. This book should not be ordered unless you are really into reading technical results of labs and a sad and slightly boring story. Munchausen is a really interesting topic but this book just didn't do it for me. I am sorry for mom and her seemingly adorable little girls. I just found the book unreadable. No pics in my edition. I would have loved to see Sara Shimoda, MD. I felt like I was at work the entire time. The book was work. Not recommended. I think "Sickened" was a much better book on this strange subject.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	A unique and original TC book. A story that starts as the narrative of a young girl growing up in a hard scrabble world. That story morphs into a love story, one that is probably very familiar to many of our parents and grandparents. Elaine, the mother of the little girl, Brenda who is murdered, endures cheating, beatings, alcoholism, disappointment and a few good times with grace and dignity. There is no mystery who killed Brenda and the story of his finally being brought to justice reminds all of us of the frailty of life and the cruelness of some of our fellow human beings. Highly recommended.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I love TC books where a woman goes crazy with the shopping and then guns her husband down to cover it up before the bills can arrive. This book is so reminiscent of Barbara Stager who shot two different husbands to cover up her wild spending. Lee Orsini (or one of her other many pseudonyms) makes a perfect black widow. $20,000 at Nordstroms? A $1,000 per month mortgage? All this on her husband's $13,000 a year salary? Then there is the issue of the $40,000 she misplaced. I love how in these stories the femme fatale is never that good looking. This one is described with a weak chin and a huge behind. What is it about these women that keep successful men (a vet, a lawyer) coming back for more? Give me some of your secrets, girl!
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	Ahh, I love this book. Barbara Stager. Someone mentioned "The Church Lady" in their review and that is a perfect characterization. This woman was the epitome of a fake prim and proper gal who is so evil and black inside. She killed two different husbands in the same way all to cover her shopping and money addictions. She was also a naughty girl and had no problem breaking her marriage vows. The book is engrossing and is absolutely well written. Highly recommended. I have read it several times.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	A crazed female doctor...so jealous about her husband's affairs and her own issues of self worth that she would get drunk and torch her own newly bought, beautiful home with her children in it just to prove a point. This is one of a kind with a terrific author to chronicle each misstep. I love true crime because it always makes me feel better about my own life and helps me take my mind off my own problems. Any woman, as smart as her, who could make it through med school, drive fast cars, get her own man and still end up a fat worthless slob makes me feel like a million bucks! LOVE THIS BOOK. Have read it many times over.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	In the last week, I read this and the AA "Big Book" and was glad to see there are alternatives for "alcoholics" out there that aren't guilt or shame based like 12 step programs are. I really didn't put that together until I read about moderation. AA wants to have you admit you are powerless, the bad things you did while under the influence, and join for life all while confessing "Hi, I'm...and I'm an alcoholic". It doesn't matter how many years sober you have been, you are always called one. There are people out there who can drink without getting drunk. If you can't, don't try moderation but certainly, don't self flagellate if you stumble like AA would have you do.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	So this is try three for me on reading about different ways to deal with alcohol and drug addictions. I have read AA literature and a book on moderation and now here is "The Cure". While I never felt that this book was written to be a scam or an ad the only really good part is the chapter written by Chris Prentiss's son, Pax. His chapter on addiction beats any story in the AA Big Book. It is very long so it made the book actually somewhat worthwhile. I also found humor in the idea of hiring a Chinese Medicine doctor, seeing a psych at least three days a week, and all the other professionals I am supposed to assemble for my recovery dream team. No, this book is not a viable answer for most people. However, it is an interesting to take that we abuse substances because of something that happened to us in the past and once we work through it we will have no desire to ever use again. I can't imagine that Pax realizing and confessing that he never felt as good as his dad helped him never want to do heroin again! I would recommend other reading on this subject.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	One of the best addiction memoirs out there. I watched her show-I believe it was only on for one season-and I didn't really like it. Now that I have read her book I think she could have enhanced her intervention-type program with more stores from her own past. It was only alluded to on television. Being 17, pregnant, on multiple drugs and guarding a dealer's stash by pistol is quite a history. This book is unique the way is goes back and forth between her and her mother's memories. Very well written and moving. Very sad...
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	This is an absolute must read for every TC fan. You are instantly transported to an atmosphere of civil unrest where a young girl Tanya comes of age at Berkley. Not only do you feel like you are there, you get to read about all the great music that became the soundtrack of this sorrowful story. You get to read about a culture that I would guess is little known by Americans, that of the Hindu Indian. On one hand, Tanya, the carefree American teen is trying to find her first love and dealing with many personal demons from home. Then we have our "villain", Prosenjit, who you empathize with the entire time. Tanya goes out with him once and he goes and procures her a wedding Sari. I will leave it at this because the other reviews can stand alone but this haunting tale will keep you up at night.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	I am not surprised that there is nothing on here about this book at all...it was terrible, just awful. Once again, there is no real story here. A low life career criminal Lisa Rahn commits random credit card fraud and then ends up getting into a fire fight with her estranged boyfriend and ends up shooting him. Other than that you get to read a lighthearted piece about people meeting through personal ads, recent advances in police work and DNA, several geographical lessons and also the really enlightened line that the victim was very good about keeping his cats away from his tropical fish tank. Please burn any copies you may find of this. I am not even going to return it to my used book store to keep others from experiencing this same horror.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	I see that this book garnered all kinds of feedback and people seemed to either love this or hate it. I started out very interested considering that some heavy hitters in the lit world appeared to feel this was an important work (Hunter S. Thompson, not Maxim, FYI) but anyway...I ended up feeling like I had just read an antiwar, antimilitary pamphlet written possibly by an aging hippy. I gave this two stars because I always enjoy reading creepy and gothic histories of families such as babies being born in ramshackle cabins and women who wear wigs living in seedy motels with pregnant pitbulls. However, that is where my enjoyment ended. I found myself having to reread passages and I think it is just because they were so overwritten in what has been described on here by others as "purple prose". I also grew weary of being expected to feel sorry for every woman in this book regardless of the horrible life decisions she had made from having kids with multiple men, substance abuse and dealing, and willing welfare lifestyles to mention a few. How is it that every gal in here was beaten senseless by every single man they married, dated, slept with, or danced with for 10 minutes at the local speakeasy? All this and I haven't even touched base (no pun) on that fact that the military, specifically the Marines, are defamed at every turn. I just found this to be complete conjecture based loosely on a very sad and grisly double murder that happened to be committed by a Marine who had all sorts of OTHER problems long before his military career began and I am not sure why the author chose to take this and turn it into some kind of sweeping portrait of all soldiers, men, the desert, poor women, poor people, race relations of blacks and Phillipinos, and odd references the Old Testament. I would not categorize this as any "Must read" for my fellow TC fans out there!!! Rubbish.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	The foster care system is broken. Not just in CA where this book takes place but in Ohio too where we recently had a foster couple lock their ward in a closet while they went to some hillbilly family reunion in Kentucky all weekend while he suffocated to death. This book chronicles the dysfunctional couple of Alvin and Theresa who have no business being in the business of fostering. Why were they approved to take in kids when Alvin had restraining orders against him and they both had been arrested for domestic violence? Theresa had been reported as being abusive to her elderly nursing home patients and was fired from one such job. These are the people we send hurting and abused children to? The birth parents were meth heads who could care less a baby was even born. The couple who tried to adopt him (a teacher and a computer salesmen) were turned away over the fact they left him with their parents as babysitters OCCASIONALLY and the fact they may have "yelled in front of the child". However, the child ends up with a scrotum the size of a grapefruit under Theresa and Alvin's care and dies from a beating. The author writes with a terrific no-nonsense style. She speaks the truth and is not afraid to call a spade a spade. Excellent author, horrifying story.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I have a repressed memory of this case from my childhood (ha ha). No, I remember all the hoopla that came about when all these people began "remembering" things that happened to them as children, even at ages where you really can't remember anything. Sexual abuse seemed to be the common theme but this case dealt with that and a murder as well. This author writes with incredible detail and insight...yes, the trial scene is very long but if you are really interested in this case, you will know everything when you're done (I never want to read the evidence list of the rock, shoe, dress, etc again). Eileen Franklin is a very troubled lady who most likely took things that did happen to her in her life and created a fantastic account of witnessing her childhood friend's murder. I am sure she was abused by her father but that he likely did not commit the crime of murder. I don't feel bad that he spent seven years in prison. That is not nearly enough to atone for the way he treated his family. I wonder if Eileen's "heavy drug use" could have caused some of this. It is alluded too but not really dwelled upon. Certainly that could lead to some false memories and much of her instability. I wonder how she feels about her life now, 20 more years later and if she still believes her father killed Susan Nason or if she knew it was a lie all along.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	0	It is hard to come up with points that have not already been made on this forum but after reading all the reviews I have a few bones to pick. First, I think the research and the time spent on this book (six years) is amazing and shows the author's dedication without trying to capitalize on a sensational case by publishing this book before the trial or anything like that. One thing that bothered me the most here is that these boys knew "Leslie" ever since they were young children. Rather than a having a brotherly type affection for her which would have been appropriate here they decided to harass her at every turn and no one ever did any thing to stop it. The bullying issue is hot right now but back in 1989 parents and teachers had the attitude that these things were to be solved by the children like "Lord of the Flies". Also, one boy Chris Archer had been trying to get Leslie to a wood shed with him for a long time. He is the one who lured her to the basement. Anyone who thinks Leslie could consent to this knows nothing about the mentally challenged and should really do some reading on that before expressing such ignorant opinions. If this had been a popular cheerleader it still would have been rape. I also can't believe Bryant Grober received a lesser sentence when he is the one who first whipped his pants off and started the assault. The violence used against Leslie was extreme and brutal making this almost worse than a typical gang rape. Two last things: I have a major issue with the reviews on here that insinuate the author wrote this to somehow give himself a catharsis from a lonely high school experience where he was terrorized by the jocks. Are you kidding me? I also don't see how race is an issue here. The victim was white (yes from Canada but still white like the perps). How is this a race issue at all? Are you confusing this with the Duke Lacrosse or Kobe Bryant or what? I just read online that the police officer's son, "The loudmouth" Richard Corcoran killed himself recently over a domestic incident with his estranged wife. I would love to know more about where these little sociopaths are today, how did they fare in jail, and are they still serving out their sentences? What does their future hold for them? How are Leslie and her family doing? Did she get to have any kind of normal life after all this?
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	This is an incredible book written by an attorney about the long, bitter, and pathetic custody battle over a young girl named Hilary. The parents are both surgeons but act like two buzzards fighting over a piece of meat. The book pulls you in and each turn of event becomes more shocking and egregious. I would recommend this to any one with an interest in child custody and as a cautionary tale for parents about to begin this process. I can just see the esteemed Dr. Elizabeth Morgan chasing after her husband down the driveway with a tape recorder thrust in his face trying to capture him saying anything she could use against him. Dr. Morgan was clearly a weirdo, sharing bath time with her 68 year old mother. Her father, even as a psychologist, gets in on all the action diagnosing child molestations all over the place. What a bunch of dysfunctional lunatics but it makes for very interesting reading.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	Today, if a 15 year old murdered his parents, we would probably spend a great amount of time trying to find out why. Back in 1961 when Wayne Dresbach murdered his adopted parents no one seemed to be too worried about it - or they were studiously trying to cover it up. Patricide is an ancient concept that seems to have always fascinated people, authors and scholars alike. Children who break the law often receive miserable legal assistance and are locked up in dangerous and substandard jails and detention facilities. Here, Wayne is questioned with no attorney, no family present, and then placed in an adult prison to wait. His lawyer is completely incompetent and the judge appears to be in bed with the state. Michael Mewshaw, the author, was a teenage friend of Wayne and his family and his parents take in Wayne's younger brother after the murders. He was a perfect candidate to write this since he was an author anyways. He writes very well and you want to know what is going to happen next even if much of it is distasteful to read. The father, Pat Dresbach, was a sadist with a Napoleon complex who bullied everyone in his life. His wife, Shirley, was a cold, taciturn woman whose ambivalence towards her son Wayne probably sealed her fate. This story is very similar to Leslie Walker's "A Sudden Fury" where a teenage boy kills his adopted mother and father and leaves his brother behind. We have a "battered wife" defense for women...is there a similar one available for our battered children?
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I have been using this for a while now and I am having an easy time not feeling groggy in the morning. I also use Calms Forte and they seem very similar. I am not having an GI upset like some vitamins and herbs can cause so I am pretty pleased with this product.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I actually requested this product from the Vine program for a friend who just had a baby and she is pleased as punch with these bottles. Now, the baby isn't talking but he isn't spitting up or crying uncontrollably with colic either. Playtes is a trusted product and these bottles are nice and wide and help your baby go from breast to bottle with ease. These would make a great shower gift as you get three neutral colored bottles and they are nine ounces which as all you good mommies know is the perfect size!
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	When scanning the book jacket, you think you are going a read a typical true crime book where a murder is laid out and then a police investigation and a trial unfold all while you find out the seamy parts of the killer's life. That is not what this book is about. It can almost be divided into three distinct subjects. The life and death of childhood friend Lee Snavely, the life and crimes of serial killer Gary Taylor, and a memoir of the author's own childhood, struggle with her sexuality, and coming to some kind of reconciliation with her own parents. As other reviewers have mentioned, the author had little firsthand information and so she reconstructed some of the story from police reports and court transcripts like any TC writer does and the rest is kind of an ethereal fairy tale of sorts. I like how she ended the book with the note that she has asked to be informed of any changes in Gary Taylor's case but was saddened to see online she is deceased at the young age of 55. Now there really is no one else to look out for Lee.One more note, as someone else mentioned already, you can read more about Gary Taylor in the Ann Rule crime file named succinctly, "The Computer Error and the Killer". Lee Snavely is mentioned briefly as Lee Fletcher, an at first unknown prostitute from a Toledo bar. Imbrie's book at least gives Lee a background and a human story that is so much more than a nameless, faceless, streetwalker.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	1	I first read this book about 20 years ago as an impressionable teen and thought it was pretty scandalous. Of course, I was busy reading Judy Blume books then. I reread it now and find it to be quite laughable and unbelievable. Carlie is certainly the Pollyanna of the drug world. First, she is just a sweet and innocent 15 year old who goes to a party and is given a Coke. She unknowingly was slipped acid and this one experience leads her into a life of utter debauchery. She begins dealing drugs to grade school kids. She runs away and miraculously is able to open a trendy boutique at the age of 17. She becomes clean and does a lot of babysitting. Then, a rival druggie babysitter gets jealous over a lost gig and laces her peanuts with more drugs. She is sent to an insane asylum. Finally, after this experience she turns her life around again, falls in love with a college man and is happy making muffins and hanging out with Gran and Gramps. Then the epilogue. Dead of drugs. No one knows why or how but certainly someone should do an autopsy at the very least or maybe launch a criminal investigation against that shady babysitting rival.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	Extra wide nipples and a drop-in bottle system seem to help babies learn to bottle feed best in my opinion. Also, I know a baby can get thrush from drinking out of an undersanitized bottle so this system helps to eliminate that problem. It is wonderful when a company consistently makes a good durable product that you can be proud to give as a gift at a shower or just be confident in buying for yourself. I have always trusted Playtex with my baby.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	This book was written by infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's father after his arrest and trial. It is not a sensational account of his gruesome murders. It is not filled with dirty family secrets and finger pointing. Instead, it is one man trying to make sense of something that few of us could. How could the little boy he loved so much grow up into a monster who could do such vile things to other young men? I really felt for him as he would mull over his own thoughts and compulsions in order to try and find some common ground with his lost son. I just don't think any "normal" person would be able to. I had always read about the great childhood Jeffrey was purported to have but upon reading Lionel's book I now see it was less than perfect. No, no one beat him but his mother was a drug abuser all through her pregnancy and his childhood. She took "Equanil" in great quantities which really isn't even prescribed any more. She seemed to be a bit of a "White wine zombie Mom" with her pills. We don't know the effect of the medications on Jeffrey as a developing baby in her womb. Lionel Dahmer muses about this as well. It seemed to be a very unhappy home with his parent's marriage finally ending in a necessary divorce. Clearly, all that doesn't excuse Jeff Dahmer's horrific crimes but I think his father has given us all a gift, a chance to see behind the tabloids and an opportunity to at least get a chance of understanding. I could not put it down.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	This is really not a true crime book per se in that no one is really sure what happened to all these missing Canadian prostitutes in Vancouver. The amazing author presents several possibilities but the main thrust of the book is spent chronicling the hardscrabble lives of several of the missing women. I can't say I "enjoyed" reading their personal stories as so many of these women were abused as children, pregnant teens multiple times over, and continuously struggled with hard drug addictions. When some of them tried to reach out for help they were often turned away by doctors and other resources. One missing woman was actually told by a doctor shortly before she disappeared that she wasn't "doing enough heroin" to qualify for methadone treatment. If you have any interest in the plight of the homeless, or just those who have made some poor choices and could use some understanding you will likely get something out of this book. The pictures were done by professional photographer Lincoln Clarke and are haunting.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	This is one of my favorite TC books and I was glad to get to reread this updated version which includes new theories and updates on the civil trial of the de Villers family. I find Ms. Rother's books to be extremely well researched and fast paced and I was not bothered by any repetition in this book as some other reviewers pointed out. Kritin Rossum makes for an intriguing murder suspect and the book is full of tales of her meth addiction, extramarital affairs, and work place hijinks. It is certainly too bad that no one could gather any more evidence against her boss Dr. Michael Robertson as you have to wonder how much he may have been involved too.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	0	You will tire of Ms. Audrey Marie Hilley quickly if you have read other books with women that share her nature... (see "Everything She Ever Wanted") by Ann Rule, anything about Barbara Stager, "Before He Wakes" (the church lady) or the book about Velma Barfley (umm, I mean Barfield). These are middle aged women that somehow, successful men continue to find attractive and facilitate their murderous schemes...They enjoy the use of arsenic and small fires. They seduce as a means to an end. They are obsessed with money to the point they kite checks and cash in life insurance polices willy nilly! Their general nature and lack of remorse or care for anything living annoys me to the point I can only read so much about them before I need to change to something else. This book is well written and certainly leaves nothing out when it comes to another one of these self centered, self serving socios.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	If you just cannot miss reading all the horror of this case then by all means, Read "Hush Little Babies" by author Don Davis instead. This book is mainly based on the court case which us real TC fans know spells boring and uninspired if not lazy writing. While there are a few details included in this rendering that are not in Davis' book, it is still not worth your time. I don't care that her mother-in-law wore stretch pants and mini boots to trial every day although the author seems fixated on it. I read more about Darlie Routier's breast enhancement then I did about the murders or evidence. I think Don Davis gives a fair portrayal of Ms. Routier's case as well as the prosecution's case. I could go on for pages as to why I think Darlie is guilty but this is not the forum for that. As a side note, I had to rip off and throw away the hideous cover to this book due to the fact I was disgusted by it and didn't want anyone to see me reading it, especially at the park with my seven year old son! I doubt I will ever read the third book on the case by P. Springer because anyone touting Routier's innocence has clearly been duped by her soft spoken Southern charm. She is so similar to Diane Downs and Susan Smith it is crazy. And of side note, her ever faithful spouse Darin recently filed for divorce maybe at least he and their surviving son Drake can try and move on with their lives.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I really only read the best TC writers (no more Matt W. Phelps for me) but Crowley manages to be at the top of his game on this one. I have not read his other book so I can't speak for it but if you want ALL the background behind Generosa, Danny, and Ted, read no further. Not only is this a fascinating story where people who have it all can still be unhappy and dysfunctional to the point that they will ruin their children's live and squander their staggering fortunes but it is also a well written book. The reviewer on here that was naggling over whether Crowley was correct on whether someone was a condo board or co-op owner seems a tad bit petty...The overall book will keep you hooked and make you want to seek out the news documentaries on this story especially since they have been updated with "dat" Danny Pelosi's recent protestations of innocence. Generosa has since passed like her mother before her of cancer. People magazine also has a TC special edition magazine out this month with a great color pic of Danny and Geny and is worth checking out.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	0	Oddly enough I first read the David Brame story which in so many ways is sadly similar to the Dave Camm story. However, as Kim Camm's father wondered aloud how come David Camm didn't just turn the gun on himself before he shot his two young children? If only that would have been the case. I bought the book having been peripherally aware of the story from TV Docs...I cannot help but see a similarity between the Fred and Sara Tokars story from years back. Why is it so unfathomable that David Camm hired Charles Boney either to do the killing himself as a hitman or he asked him to get a "clean gun" as was alluded to by police? I guess I could gun my husband and son down in our driveway and place a sweatshirt I found at my local YMCA with Sally Doe's DNA on it and get exonerated? Or at least get three trials? How is David Camm's womanizing while married with no less than 16 women not admissible in a trial? Are you saying that sex has never been a driving force behind a murder? What about his wealthy wife's over $600,000 in life insurance? This case has touched a nerve to say the least. I will be tuned in to his trial news in the upcoming year for sure. And yes, this book was pretty good but definitely needs to be updated several times over. Get it at your library or used book store unless an addendum is added.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	0	There are two books about this same case and I would highly recommend you skip this version and read "Above Suspicion" by Joe Sharkey instead. I realize based on the other reviews here this will not be a popular view but I will take that risk. This is a terribly written book with nonessential information that at times makes no sense. For one example, check page 74 there is a paragraph that begins to explain that our "FBI Killer" Mark Putnam was not always seen as a loving father. It then goes on in great detail about Mark Putnam's sedan and his driving habits. I also found at that a hotel in London, KY serves shellfish which I was just dying to know. This book is rife with filler and does not compare at all to the work Sharkey did on his book. Not only that but he seems to have had way more cooperation from primaries in the case. I also would have been confused if I had never read the other book considering Jones just brings up Putnam's partner Poole as if we are to know who he is without even introducing him.The true tragedy in this case would be the loss of Kathy Putnam from liver failure brought on from alcoholism no doubt from trying to stand by her husband in jail and raise her children. I was sorry to hear about Susan Smith's son as well. I don't think many people reading this understand that Putnam only got 16 years (reduced to 10) due to the fact that the only reason he was arrested and convicted was because of his own admission and the fact this apparently was not premeditated (he owned a gun, you know).One last note for fans of the genre is if you Google Mark Putnam you can be treated to a recent picture of him noting he is a personal trainer in Florida touting a surgery he had on his old shoulder injury.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	There are two books about this fascinating case and I would highly recommend if you are interested to read this and skip Aphrodite Jone's "The FBI Killer". I realize her book got five stars from everyone but having purchased and read both I can tell you this is by far superior in every way. Her book is filled with confusing filler. Sharkey has written several detailed and extensively detailed TC books and this does not disappoint. I note the issues with Jone's book on that review and will not reiterate them here but suffice to say Sharkey seemed to have way more cooperation from the primaries and much more insight into Mark Putnam, Susan Smith, and Kathy Putnam.I feel the greatest loss here was the death of Kathy from liver failure brought on by alcoholism no doubt from the stress of standing by Mark during his incarceration. I am also sorry for the loss of Susan's son. I feel many people reading this story don't realize his "light" sentence was due to the fact that they had no case against him save his confession and the fact that this was clearly not a premeditated murder (he did own a gun, you know).One fun fact for true TC fans is that if you Google Mark Putnam you can see a recent picture of him mentioning that he is now a personal trainer in Florida on a website for an orthopedic surgeons' group. He mentions that he was a grumpy old man until he got his shoulder surgery. Hmmmmm.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	As soon as I picked up this slim black book, I was hooked. A fun night out to a birthday party for two young lovers winds up being the most foul. What would drive someone to kidnap these young adults and then violate their bodies and throw them away like little pieces of trash. This question led to years of theories, suspects, legal wrangling, possible misconduct all while the killer hung around. This story finally found an end because our killer Richard Hirshfield was finally handed down the death penalty for his role in this gruesome abomination. The author, Joel Davis is really the reason this case was actually solved. And although I don't think too many of the egos involved in this mess will say it, I will.The other tragedy here is that there could be so many possible suspects! These seemingly "normal" women having bigamous marriages to prisoners they were supposed to be guarding. Mothers getting pregnant as young as 15 to then have the several different men come in from time to time to play daddy. All that certainly led the "Hunt" group straight to their life choices. "HARM SEEK, HARM FIND"If you did get into this case like I did, look upThe Sex Slave Murders: The True Story of Serial Killers Gerald & Charlene Gallego
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	0	1	This is NOT standing the test of time. Yes, Andy Garcia is wonderful, hot, and earnest, but Meg Ryan still sucks and the writing and plot of this are just not very realistic. Maybe when this was made it was edgy, what with her egging the neighbor's car but it really is not standing the test of time. The soundtrack made me cringe because it is not timeless. Meg's character just seems so fake and false. The only redeeming value is the oldest daughter's acting which is great for a little kid. Overall, I would watch "Invervention", "Addicted", or "Relapse" any day of the week. This just seemed so false and unmoving.
A1DNXL8BIR5R8R	1	1	I know this product is a little gross to write about but anyway, I love Biore Pore Strips. Wet your nose with warm water and let this little paper mache get crispy then pull it off! You can hold it up to the light and see all the clogged pores you have freed. I have used these for years about once every two weeks to keep my nasal area looking clean and neat.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	This is an entertaining and insightful read. While it doesn't claim to be a business book, it certainly has great applicability to businesses great and small. If you are looking for political commentary, this book really doesn't fit the category as some commentators have suggested. Still, this is a book about the empowerment of the individual, something that is inherently pro-liberty. The thought of the rise of individualism clearly is scary to some.As a lawyer, Reynolds is a trained "issue spotter." He does not purport to know all of the answers, but the recognition of an issue is the first step to understanding it and capitalizing on it. An Army of Davids does a great job of raising a lot of issues that society, businesses and the "establishment" must grapple with over the next twenty years.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I've looked at all of them and this was the only one that had consistently good reviews. This is one of the very few times that I have bought something based solely on the reviews, but the other seats had such bad reviews that I had to give this a try. The five star rating is well-deserved.High points:1. MY WIFE PUT IT ON THE BIKE. That is historic. It is very easy to install. You can read the instructions and have it put on the bike in 5 minutes. All other seats require HOURS or require you to take it to a bike shop.2. Seat is sturdy and my little girl loves it.3. Instructions say max. weight is 38 lbs. Some reviews show a lower weight so they may be for an older model.4. MY WIFE PUT IT ON THE BIKE. Oh, I already said that.5. I'm 6'2" and this was not a problem to use. It takes a little adjustment when you are turning the bike, but that is not a problem. Did I tell you that my wife put it on the bike?Low points:1. None, other than I wish I had known that you could buy additional mounts ("stingers") at the time I bought it so I could save on shipping.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	0	0	I used it once and it bent. It is horrible and possibly the biggest piece of junk of any kind that I have ever had the misfortune of spending money on. I cannot overstate how pathetic this pump is. Don't waste your money.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	This product seems to work well and be of high quality. It is very firm and seems to provide some relief. Still, I wonder if some of the cheaper knock-offs might be at least as good. After all, it's a cushion, not a Cadillac.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I've been a Christian for a long time. However, it wasn't until reading this chronological ordering of the Bible that I began to understand a lot of things. It is a truly wonderful tool for increasing your understanding. I plan on giving it as a gift to new Christians and to some of my friends. Reading the Bible in this fashion has excited me to the point that I cannot wait to get home from work and read some more! Like the best of novels, it leaves you wanting to know "what happens next." With a traditional Bible, you may have read "what happens next" in a prior book or you may not read it for several more books.Further, I wanted an inexpensive Bible that I could sit on the table and read it while I ate breakfast and dinner. I did not want to be concerned about table accidents. This version fit the bill perfectly.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	This is a well-balanced set of knives and a good value for the money. They are rather sharp and hold their edge very well. I have not had the opportunity to sharpen them yet to see how difficult that process is. My experience with other Victorinox knives suggests that sharpening will be an easy process.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I bought this along with some Forschner knives. So far, those knives have not needed sharpening. However, I pulled some old knives out of the drawer and this quickly and effortlessly improved the edge. The only drawback is that it does not include written instructions. I had to search around online to figure out exactly how to use it. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	0	1	This pot is very thin. It dents very easily. It became dented and slightly warped early in its usage. The lid is sometimes difficult to lock and you can easily find yourself accidentally dumping your spaghetti in the sink.The biggest problem I have with it is that the coating comes off. I do not want that in my food. Once the coating comes off, the bare spots inside began to rust. To the trash!
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I bought this for myself and then after using it for a while, decided it would make a great gift. Everyone should own one of these. It is highly customizable and relatively easy to set up. Your family deserves to have this type of protection. I should have done this a long time ago.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I made the same mistake that a lot of other people made by using the steamer to cook spaghetti. Once I figured out how to use it, I was very satisfied with it. It is much better than the pot that has the strainer in the lid that this replaced. This is a very versatile product and you won't be disappointed.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	This book was a shocking revelation to me. I have not spent much time listening to many of the prosperity preachers on the Pink-Haired Lady Network, but their popularity is undeniable. What little bit of time I have spent listening to them usually "sounds" good. It is deceptive, but their constant asking for money to "plant a seed" always gave me concern, along with some of their claimed miracles. Many good people are being led astray by these people.The book is a bit dry at times and repetitive in places; otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth reading.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I bought them primarily to play with my 6 year old son who wants to play rough at times. These are much easier on me than regular boxing gloves or general rough-housing. The surprising thing is that my 3 year old daughter likes to play with them just as much as my son. When I arrive home from work, they frequently meet me at the door with the Boppers on and ready to go. Taking on two kids at once can be a bit of a workout, so that is an added benefit.This is a cheap toy. Do not expect a lifetime of use. They come with a patch kit. You'll need to experiment with the inflation level to get it where you like it.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	0	0	I give this book two stars because it had a few redeeming qualities. The book has moments (and I mean moments) of genius that might change someone's life for the better. Although mildly repetitive at times, the book is well-organized with short, easily readable chapters. Most of the book, however, is a kind of zen-like mumbo-jumbo that reads like pure psychobabble. There is a lot of focus on self-actualization, although I don't recall if the author ever uses that terminology. Really, do we need another excuse to focus on pleasing ourselves? Even the chapters about pleasing a woman and staying in her good graces are ultimately about focusing on ourselves so that we reach some higher/deeper/greater understanding/level of *something*, etc.While the book contains some good advice, it contains a lot of questionable advice and a lot of assumptions that are apparently based on little more than anectodal experience. To its credit, the book does at least make you think about some issues in a different way and for some people, that may be very powerful. It may change your life or it may waste your time.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	Unlike some other reviewers, I do not normally eat a lot of protein bars and the like. I have had a few and found this bar to be much sweeter and tastier than the others, which mostly taste like cardboard with sugar on top. This was very chewy and had a lot of cherry flavors. It tasted fresh and was surprisingly filling for such a small bar. It is definitely an above-average bar. I feel like it is made of "good stuff," but the calorie count is a bit high (200). That said, it will cure a sweets craving without nearly as much impact as a candy bar, plus it's just better for you in all respects.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	Not only does this book tell you what you need to know, it tells you what you need to think about. Many times, boards will approve something and no one really knows what was approved. This helps you get the resolutions organized in advance of a meeting so that you don't have to make them up "on the fly" and risk leaving out an important point. It is also helpful to have a book like this so that new corporations can see that there are so many things that need to be approved at the board level instead of just moving forward and taking action without board approval.This is a great resource for CEOs and corporate secretaries. Some would say that it is for small and mid-sized businesses, but I disagree. Many large businesses would benefit from this as well but at this price, no small or mid-sized business should be without a copy of this book on its shelf.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	I won't say that this is the next Christmas classic, but I have pulled it out two years in a row and it has been enjoyable to watch. If you like dogs and sweet, sappy stories that tug at the heart strings, this is a good holiday addition to your movie library.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	These work great and you can put them on and take them off rather quickly. They instantly wrap around your arm - the velcro strap is there, but it really isn't needed. I expected these to be very hard, but they aren't. They are just hard enough to keep you from getting bruised.My only negative is that they get really warm, really quick. I will use them for the exercises that require them, but then remove them.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	0	I'm a lawyer that is sometimes faced with cleaning up the messes that others have made with their entities. It seems that so many people fill out the form to organize the LLC at the Secretary of State or hire an online service provider to do it and then they are completely clueless as to what comes next. This book will guide you through the process of "what comes next." Going the do-it-yourself (DIY) route is not without risks, even when organizing the LLC. Sometimes, lawyers will organize the LLC, spend a few minutes instructing the client on what comes next and then the client is left to sink or swim. This book allows you to swim. If you follow the instructions in the book, you will likely have a stronger liability protection than 90% of the existing LLCs because most of them operate far too informally to maximize their liability protection. Yes, some of the formalities may be overkill, but if things go badly and you get sued, you will be thankful for the overkill.No, this book does not give a lot of tax advice, as some have commented. Tax advice changes too frequently and often requires a deep understanding of complex facts, particularly in an LLC context. LLC's can be taxed as an individual (i.e., "disregarded entity"), a partnership, a corporation, or an s-corporation. Because there are so many ways that LLCs can be taxed, addressing all of the tax issues in a single book would be impossible.
A1DO6DKWF3CMBD	1	1	The product seems to work well for squirrels and deer. I tried it for raccoons and it does not seem to work for them, as they continue to enter the area under my porch. Of course, the product wasn't advertised for raccoons, but I thought I would give it a shot. My review does not reflect the raccoon failure for this reason. The battery operated sprayer is a nice touch, but I wish it would reach further, as I need to spray it under my eaves to keep squirrels out. This product does not smell bad to humans, which is a definite plus.
A1DOCU22TBXD6	0	1	This was not the worst textbook I've had to read for a course, but it not the best either. It's not a book to read for fun, but it does contain some useful information.
A1DOCU22TBXD6	1	1	This is a very high quality toy. It has put up with over two years of continual play and abuse from two children, and it is still in great shape. They are fun, nice sized fruit pieces, and have been the source of countless hours of fun imaginative play. Great, great product.
A1DOCU22TBXD6	0	0	If I relied on this book to get me excited about teaching science, I would be waiting a long time. This text may have been required by the course I took, but it is a low quality test written in the obscure, academic way that gives textbooks bad name. It takes an interesting subject and makes it boring.

A1DOCU22TBXD6	1	1	Great stamps, high quality. The pink ink is a bright, highlighter pink, and my daughter a more visible ink color. But other than that, it is a great product! Very high quality and seems to hold up to frequent use.
A1DOCU22TBXD6	1	1	I love these dishes. Just the perfect size for a cat, easy to clean, and holds just the right amount of food and water.
A1DOL3GLSZ98DJ	1	1	There's not many words that can describe how amazing Arise is, especially the Remastered version.I'm not going to bore with a breakdown of the tracks, one by one. There's not a song on here that isn't amazing. The audio quality is excellent. I wish Sepultura's more recent exploits were this grand.This is the epitome of HEAVY METAL. You won't be dissapointed.
A1DOL3GLSZ98DJ	0	0	This film had some decent action scenes, but it was nothing beyond that. The story is a [compilation] of several movies you've already seen, the characters are dry and pointless, and Cuba Gooding Jr never seems to nail down exactly what kind of character he's portraying. I can't watch him act... I never know where he's coming from, and I can't watch him act like virtually the same character in every one of his movies. Skeet plays his part with no heart as well... in fact the entire cast does. I guess it must be hard to do a movie knowing the script is as horrible as this one.Don't waste your money. There are better action films out there with heartfelt acting. This one isn't it.
A1DOL3GLSZ98DJ	1	1	I was in the market for a portable printer to use with my Fujitsu Lifebook. The portable markey is pretty small, being that there are only a very few printers that are small enough to be called portable, but still print on full-size paper.At first I didn't like anything available. I checked in depth but nothing out there really caught my eye. One day I strolled on over to Canon's website and what did I see, but the i70 listed as "Coming Soon!"I decided to hold off on buying a printer until I could see the i70 in person, which I later did. It's beautiful. It's sort of a platinum silver color, with a rich blue printhead cover. It closes easily and a small magnet keeps the bottom sheet-feeder attached to the top cover (it's way cooler than I'm describing it...)Installation was a snap. Typical of Canon. I'm running Windows XP and I have no problems in the slightest.The first thing I noticed is that it's quiet. I didn't think it was really printing until I saw the paper coming out.Second: it's FAST. It's the fastest inkjet printer I've ever used, beating out my HP 1120C in both speed, noise, and print quality.It's not labled as a photo printer, but the print quality of the i70 is just amazing. If there's a difference between this and real photo printers, I haven't seen it, nor do I care. It's good. VERY good.I have not tested the infrared communications yet... I send everything to the printer via USB, which is a breeze.To sum it up:Pros:AppearenceSpeedNoiseQualityCons:Not the same silver as other Canon products (such as the LiDe30) but it's still so pretty...I HIGHLY recommend this printer.
A1DOL3GLSZ98DJ	0	0	That's right, folks: puppet sex. I'll get to that.A lot of movies make their dime off the artsy-look of wobbly video images (Blair Witch?) and that's what this film attempts. And fails at.The plot is so thin that I can barely remember it... these Gen X'ers are supposed to obtain a certain item for someone. They end up killing the creator of "The Monkey" as they call it, which looks like a huge penis with it's eyes (eyes???) sewn shut.They take it back to a woman's house (she's the pretty asian actress, the only real plus of the whole movie even though her acting in this film was almost impossible to stomach) where her friends interfere and get killed. The penis monkey wakes up and turns the friends against one another.That's when the penis monkey decides he's going to have sex with the asian woman. The passionate love scene that ensues is very graphic and embaressing to watch. What are you supposed to tell your friends when they find you watching muppet porn?The acting is terrible, the settings are dull and the story is a weak attempt to lead up to the puppet lovin, which quite obviously took more time to film than the rest of the scenes.Overall, only rent this dvd if you seriously want to know how to NOT make a movie. If you find yourself asking what to avoid when filming, I would suggest you steer clear of any ground covered in this "movie". I'm only giving it a star because 1 is as low as I can take it.
A1DOLD6O5RFU3S	0	0	This could have left any two tracks out due to some of the ad libbed rap that I hear on the demo. The song "OH BOY" as well as the laid back track "HEY MA" which gives him the smooth swagger that appeals to me is not even included, keep it real CAM, " I AM "
A1DOUV0BHPKC96	0	0	Every time Patricia Cornwell sets a book in a place that is not Richmond, VA or centers the plot around Kay Scarpetta's lesbian niece, it goes to hell in a Neiman Marcus handbasket.She's obviously trying to get out some message by getting in the reader's face with the lesbian Lucy character and she's been doing this in her books for some time.I am tempted to say that it's "pro-gay," given the times we live in, but Lucy is so unlikeable as a character and is always so personally unhappy, that I can't guess why Cornwell returns to her over and over.I picked Ms. Cornwell's work back up after swearing off of her stuff 4 books back--I wish I'd kept my own vow to no longer read her!Some writers and their writing don't "age" well along with their physical bodies; sorry to say that Ms. Cornwell's now firmly in that group.
A1DOUV0BHPKC96	1	1	In my quest to see all of the great old films of WWII made in the 1940's, I bought this one and I'm glad I did!It's very different from the "typical" battle-action films; this one is set mainly in Japan where American Army Air Corps pilots are put on trial for "war crimes."In the course of their imprisonment, they are tortured to confess to crimes they didn't commit.They have no real lawyers.The Geneva Convention is never mentioned.They go bravely and proudly to their deaths by execution.All of it highlights not only the humane treatment we give enemy combatants now at Guantanamo Bay but also the fanatical aim of world domination of today's Islamofacist enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan is exactly like that of the Shinto/Bushido Japanese that we vanquished in WWII.This movie is really a must see that acurately portrays the enemy in wartime as truly evil with none of the moral equivalence that we get from Hollywood and the Media these days.
A1DOUV0BHPKC96	0	0	This reproduction of an old ABC variety show is just sad, featuring cheap sets and 3rd-rate stars.Poor Margaret Hamilton's make-up was very badly done.Florence Henderson tries to sing and Paul Lynde does way too much mugging for the camera in place of witty dialogue.KISS lip-syncs 3 songs and they're not very good ones, plus Gene doesn't do the "tongue" thing.It certainly took me back to the 70's in the hurry, but not really in a good way.The whole disc is a paean to the "comedy genius" of Paul Lynde, if you imagine that.

A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	I found the reviews that said it didn't hold true to the characters in the first two season a bit odd. They are very much the same characters and we are allowed to get even closer to them, especially Capt. Jack. And comments that it was darker than the others weren't watching the same season 2 I was.Each episode was tense and built on to the next. The last episode was painful to watch with our heroes unable to move freely about to do their work, and the governments total lack of regard for the children of the world, but ultimately they do save the day. I didn't find Jack's stand from day 4 to day 5 about the loss of life a contradiction, I think it had more to do with the few for the many and there wasn't any way to avoid that. I think the end is more about why he was chosen 40 years ago and how much he has changed since then. He may have made the same decision, but lost everything in the process. And he did see is grandson, just not as often as he would like, so he did have a relationship with him. On a side note, it was nice that they didn't kill, stab or shoot Rhys.The acting was brilliant. Peter Capaldi was especially touching presenting the politician who does what he has to until it breaks him. And those conversations of the government agencies - can't you just see that really happening?I can't wait for season 4 and hope that they add Lois Habiba and Johnson to the cast.
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	0	0	I guess if you like romance novels then this book would be great. I got it because I thought it was a thriller and man it was boring. If spies really behaved like this, they would all be dead. The characters were poorly realized, dialog even worse. It might have been a good story, but the characters spent more time dwelling on their desire to have sex with each other than they did on their mission. I finally just started skimming over those portions just to get to the end. What a bore!
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	I really enjoyed this book. The characters were well written and interesting, the story was well formed and the conclusion was believable. This is my first introduction with this writer, I look forward to more.
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	Does the show compare to new crime shows? No, but it is fun. It was like the Love Boat of crime shows in it's time. It is very good for what it is, a fluffy murder mystery show.
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	The flag is well made with vibrant colors. Doesn't hurt that it looks just like my male pom modeled for it - can't beat that.
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	I bought this to take my three cats from Virginia to Florida. It was very roomy, allowed me to put a litter box on one side and food on the other without worrying that they would tip litter into their food. If you are planning on traveling with multiple cats, this is definitely a major plus.
A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	1	1	Brilliant casting raised this show from being just another female cop show. They also went against what seemed to be the norm - where a female is promoted and everyone is out to get her. In this case she did come in with that sense of resentment, but episode by episode she wins over the members of her team, in fact, it is that which makes season 1 my favorite of all the seasons. It was a star vehicle written for Kyra Sedgwich, but the secondary cast is outstanding. They added some of the best character actors who had been in the business for years, and new ones to keep an eye on - in fact it was no surprise that they were so popular they kept them together for the follow up series. Jon Tenney's character is the perfect partner, loving her with all her flaws, but standing up to her when she has stepped over the line. You can actually see the affection that J.K. Simmons' character has for Brenda, G.W. Bailey and Anthony John Denison are fabulous as the older detectives and I was happy to see that the new show kept their focus episode. The only thing that I ever found odd was that they never made Gina Ravera a regular. She was there for a while, but wasn't in all the episodes, so it was almost like she was added at the start with the knowledge of how she would exit seasons later.
A1DQTCDGRC26RF	1	1	I loved the Christmas Spectacular as a kid and this video brings it all back and then some! If you can't make it to New York for the current show, this video is the next best thing and it's a lot better than watching the Rockettes in the Thanksgiving Day parade. I bought the video direct from Time-Life which was offering a 'twofer' with another Christmas-time video called 'Christmas in New York' - a 90 minute tour of all the Christmas decorations and Christmas related sites in the city, accompanied by a nice arrangement of uplifting xmas music. Either of these videos would've been worth the price alone!Christmas In New York

A1DQU12H85VGJX	1	1	I couldn't believe it. I rarely watch TV shows or the news for that matter because it is usually very boring, very dry or very depressing. Oprah? Plu-eaze. But I'll watch movies and documentaries that pique my interest, sometimes A&E;, Discovery Channel or the History Channel.A friend recommended 'Lost' so I started ordering the episodes through Netflix and couldn't stop. I can't believe I bought both seasons through amazon.com. Lost a lot of sleep and the kids (teens) became addicted and glued to the tube. It is that well-written.OK, so these folks were stranded on a mysterious island after a plane crash. We're not talking Tom Hanks here, even though Castaway was a very good movie. The relationships that develop between these new islanders are very rivating. The mysteries of the island keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll be lucky if you can drag yourself off to a much-needed bathroom break or even eat for that matter. Phone calls go unattended. Plan to put your life on hold until you get through this.Dare I say I'm anticipating purchasing Season 3? The writers and producers of this show have done an excellent job. Truly entertaining.
A1DQU12H85VGJX	1	1	I sent this DVD to a friend who was contemplating working for a contractor (KBR) in Iraq driving a fuel truck. After viewing the film, he changed his mind. He decided the money wasn't worth his life.This is an excellent documentary which shows the reality of the Iraq war -who is dying in it and who it profiting from it. Not that I always had my suspicions but this video brought it home. I didn't know the contractor body count (800+) is not included in the official military body count, not to mention the wounded and maimed. It's like these people do not exist."Iraq for Sale" is truly worth buying and showing all your friends who may still be following the NeoCons hard-line politics on this war. Follow the money trail on this war and you will have your eyes opened. It will make you think of where of the taxpayers' money is going for this war - and the news isn't good, except for those on the receiving end.
A1DQU12H85VGJX	1	1	Here was another library book that I just had to own! More than another self-help book, Chris Largent did an admirable job of explaining how paradigm conditioning has worked throughout human history - but more so toward America's present-day societal paradigms and how we got here.Simply put, everyone of us is the product of our biological, physical, educational, emotional, and media environment. From birth, we have our innate survival instincts which start with recognizing we'll get some attention if we cry. Subconsciously we learn how to maniuplate those around us and yet, we are just as manipulated. In other words, we become addicted to our paradigm - sometimes good, sometimes bad - thing is, once you recognize the patterns, you feel great become you know you can change your world.This book is not a fast read. Not that's it's complicated, it's just worth your time to absorb the message and find out surprising things about yourself, your family, your community, your friends, your government. Highly recommended.
A1DR5I2HJ2SKUU	1	1	I have purchased several of these and will buy quite a few more. I give this book away, and ask that whomever reads it, then pass it on promptly to another. We should all be aware of the selfless people and what is being done mostly unbeknownst to us, on our behalf by our American military. It's humbling for the rest of us.
A1DR5I2HJ2SKUU	1	1	The disc arrived exactly as expected in perfect condition. Thank you. Going to get my grandchildren hooked on this one.
A1DR5I2HJ2SKUU	1	1	My book cover shows 3 loaves of bread with the foremost loaf sliced to expose the inside of the bread. It is a different cover than the one shown here, perhaps because it is the 2005 Revised Edition. Have tried about 100 of the approximately 130 recipes in this book. After baking, I rated each bread on a scale of 1 to 10. Of the recipes that I tried, here are my choices for a 10 rating:~~English Muffin Bread on page 34~~Cream of Wheat Bread on page 61~~Irish Soda Bread on page 110 (After Dough cycle, remove from machine, place dough in baking pan. Let rise for 45 minutes, covered. Bake for 16 minutes at 400 degrees.~~Sweet Potato Bread on page 116 (especially good toasted. I used canned diced carrots or babyfood.)~~Brioche on page 129 (use 3 1/4 cups bread flour ~ bake muffins 15 to 17 minutes. Bake bread 35 minutes.)~~English Muffins on page 142 (authentic and easy in addition to delicious.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here are the recipes that I rated as 9 1/2:~~Oregano Bread on page 119 (makes 2 loaves. After DOUGH cycle, remove from machine. Let rise in baking pan 40 minutes. After 2nd rise, bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.)~~Potato Bread on page 105 (Use DOUGH cycle. Remove from machine onto greased pan. Cover. Let rise 40 minutes. Bake in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.~~Oatmeal Bread on page 57 (Very good tasting, but short.)~~Wheat Germ Sesame Bread on page 55~~Swedish Rye Bread on page 65 (not a very high bread)~~Ricotta Bread (If making rolls with this, use DOUGH cycle. Divide dough into 8 to 12 pieces. Place on greased cookie sheet. Cover. Let rise 30 to 40 minutes. Bake in 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.~~Sour Cream Bread on page 36~~Sally Lunn on page 31 (rich)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Coconut Pineapple Bread on page 98 received a 9 rating, although I used coconut extract instead of the pineapple extract that the rtecipe called for.Especially helpful is the overnight directions on page 25 and 30 that make it easy to prepare the dough the night before and then bake it in the morning.
A1DR5I2HJ2SKUU	1	1	Love these because they have a solid piece of fabric underfoot, so that the wearer is stepping on a smooth, soft surface. I pull the smooth piece of fabric forward and up to cover my toes. That way, my toes aren't poking through the holes of the fishnets as happens with every other brand that I have tried. These are professional and they last and last. You will not find a more comfortable, well made, classic pair of fishnets.
A1DRI0R09RV057	1	0	Pure New Orleans -- these songs are obviously well loved and carefully selected. The originals stand up to the standards, particularly where "Yes We Can Can" follows "All These People," which I downloaded as soon as it hit iTunes last year. Nobody has expressed his anger at the post-storm pathos more elegantly than Harry, and no one has proved a more passionate advocate for the city and its people. Vive la Nouvelle Orleans! I want to be eating gumbo and etouffee and shrimp salad somewhere between Magazine and St. Charles every time I hear these songs!
A1DRI0R09RV057	1	1	Don't be fooled -- Amazon lists three tracks, but the disc has only two. They promptly sent me a replacement when I complained, and it was the exact same two-track CD. But for anyone who doesn't want to fork over the $10 or so to buy the U218 (full of songs any die-hard fan already has), this is a great way to get the soaring, chiming "Window in the Skies." The second track, "Tower of Song" grew on me, but I wouldn't have bought it for itself.
A1DRI0R09RV057	0	1	At $7, this is a rip. For just $5 more, you can get the excellentFrenchmen, Desire, Good Children: And Other Streets of New Orleansthat will tell you the story of the city and its nomenclature since the Choctaws were first annoyed by the French. I am terribly disappointed in this purchase and will likely return it. Anyone who knows the city will see this slim offering as a tourist bauble.
A1DRI0R09RV057	1	1	I was sad to reach the end because I had such fun reading this! Olivia's keen British wit and the book's fast pace make it a fun escape. The reviewers who grinch that is it implausible, etc. need to lighten up. I tend to be one of those "that would never happen" people, but when you are clearly reading a silly novel, get over it. Besides, the pastiches of the cranky editors and vapid Hollywood hangers-on are both spot-on and a hoot. I would love to see this made into a movie with Ian McKellen as the MI6/professor character.
A1DRI0R09RV057	0	1	I love Shakespeare, but I have to say, this is one of the dullest efforts I've ever seen, despite the usually delightful Ben Kingsley as the fool. This adaptation d-r-a-g-s. Shakespeare should be about the language and the action, not the setting and mise-en-scene, and I kept waiting for the actors to talk and the camera to turn from scenery to faces. Perhaps my expectations were overly high, since the cast and director come with excellent pedigree. Try the "Midsummer Night's Dream" with Kevin Kline and that skinny girl who played Ally McBeal -- it's a hoot!
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	Awww, the good old days!Wouldn't it be great to go back to a time when life was simple? Of course, we'd be without computers, but there are time I think it'd be worth it.Since we can't rewind our lives, the next best thing is watching a family in that time frame.Donna Reed 2 is a great show. The picture and sound suits me fine. Excellent quality.I've noticed some say the picture is grainy..maybe those of you who feel this way watched reruns on TVLand. For those who lived in the 50's and 60's watched TV shows with lines, spots, all types of blemishes. lol.My only gripe is, I wish there each disk had Special Features..Bloopers would be fantastic. Interviews. Perhaps later versions will have them..Let's hope.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	IMO, 'The Shining' is a fantastic movie. So much so, before purchasing the VHS, I taped it from tv..Eventually, I bought the VHS. When DVD's first came out, I had no intention of buying duplicates. 'That is,' except for a few favorites.The Shining, which falls in my favorite catagory, was then bought on DVD.Then, Amazon had a deal, The Shining & The Shining remake, for 'X' price..the set ended up in my collection.Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers played excellent roles. Each character, realistic.Wendy and Danny held haunting looks, Jack, mad. 'wonder if he was acting, lol, and Scatman, going out of his way to help a family he didn't know but pitied.I get goose bumps thinking about The Shining: The howling wind, Jack conversing with the dead, walking around hypnotically, intending to chop up his family, Wendy and Danny hiding and terrified.Although I love Steven King, I wouldn't buy a novel/movie because his name is on the cover. In fact, I prefer his older writing to new. It wouldn't have mattered who wrote The Shining; it was a great story.It's true King wasn't satisfied with the first Shining film. I think he felt cutting certain parts, like the topiary scenes, didn't do his movie justice, didn't express meanings he conveyed through his writing.Yet, he agreed the show would go on, despite his opinions and feelings. The Shining was one of the first movies that made him what he is today.Mention Steven King and most think, Here's Johnny...Another thing. Some people complain the book and movie differs. That's understandable. I can't think of one book, made into a movie, with word by word lines and deeds. Despite the author.Cujo is a good example. Totally different ending.King once said, the only movie he's seen that is true to the book, is Rosemary's Baby. Close, but untrue.For those who love horror, check out The Shining. Rent/buy the tape, don't bother watching on TV. Dubbing ruins it. Not to mention annoying commercials.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	The first time I saw this movie, 'after reading the book, and under the impression it was based on a true story,' it scared the heck out of me. Not quite as scary as The Exorcist, but just the thought of going through what the Lutz's did, was enough to give me nightmares.Being raised by a very superstitious family, growing up with ghost and demon tales, made it all the more scarier.After reading feedback, especially the 1 & 2 stars, many people were put off by Amity's sound effects. IMO, the sound effects weren't over-done, nor placed in every scene like some claimed. Besides, what's spookier than sleeping in a big, old house, not long after murders were committed, on a dark, windy night, with roaring thunder and striking lightning?Considering the year Amityville Horror was released, I think it was well-done. Not my favorite, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars, but definately one of the top 20. It's much better than the remake, which I didn't like. In fact, we watched the remake on DVD, as soon as it hit the video stores, and I can't remember one part..Reason: One word.. BORING.Whether or not AH is deemed a classic makes no difference. It's a very good, scary movie, and anyone who enjoys horror should buy the DVD. I did.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	Possession arrived in Very Good to Excellent condition, considering it's a used book. Pages and cover, in in-tact. I would definately order from this seller again. Thanks.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	I was hoping 'The Complete Ozzie and Harriet Collection' would come out, but so far, no luck. I've researched different sets, but none had as many episodes as 'The Essential Ozzie & Harriet.'This DVD set has it's ups and downs, but many more ups..Definately, a Must Buy, a 5-Star-plus Rating.Although this 12 Disk set isn't in the same order as the weekly show, in the first two disks, David and Ricky are young boys. As the episodes progress, so do the handsome brothers. From children to married adults.If you enjoyed Ozzie and Harriet shows, you'll love 'The Essential Ozzie and Harriet.'The price can't be beat. I hope they remake a second 100 Episodes, then a third, then the remaining shows. It might not be in order, but it's one way to get the complete collection.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	The Best of the Adventures of the Ozzie and Harriet is the second set I purchased. Those who love the Nelson's should invest in this 4-disk colletion.What a family! They're the type of family we'd love to claim as our own. Watching each episode, really watching, brings back fond memories. A time of innocence.Watching each episode gives one a feeling of joy. I get goose bumps thinking about their wonderful, loving family.If you're too young to remember the Nelsons, and enjoy heart-warming shows, give the set a try. Or, if you have family members who watched the Nelsons' weekly TV show, give it as a gift.
A1DRI4UVR82SI	0	1	For starters, all "I can say is I'm happy I purchased a 4.00, used copy. Too bad for shipping...BTW, I have never bought a used DVD before Paranormal Activity.It's said, PA is based on a true story...'reason I bought the movie.' The day the DVD arrived, I decided to watch it. The first screen says, Alternate Ending. LOL. What? If this movie is based on a true story, why would it have an alternate ending???A friend, 'maybe foe,' told me PA is as good if not better than The Exorcist. I am a true horror buff. Fiction or Non.What a disappoinment! I'm shocked this, ahem, movie was shown at the theater. It's phony, boring, and plain stupid.Parroting Blair Witch, 'project.' Another so-called true story!Think I'll set up a camera, put on a spooky-sound CD, have people, who aren't supposed to be in the room run pass the camera, and make a million dollars.If you must see PA, rent it first, then make up your mind whether it's worth purchasing.I also ordered a 'used' $4.00, PA2 DVD....it's sitting on a table, waiting to be watched. I am NOT in any hurry to view a sequel to a Part 1 awful movie, but seller needs feedback, so......
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	I saw the movie Rivals on LMN. Because I deemed it a very good movie I decided to buy a copy. My first stop was Amazon; unfortunately it's only sold for Region 2 players.I also checked other DVD/CD sites, and Lifetime/LMN but no luck there either.Will Rivals ever be made as a Region 1 DVD? It's an excellent movie. Thanks, Toni
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	Throughout my life, I've watched numerous Horror Movies. IMO, The Exorcist is still the spookiest ever. I believe it has more meaning/impact to those whom were raised and/or are religious.There are newer movies made today attempting to parrot The Exorcist, but none come close. Although some are worth viewing.When The Exorcist, 'version you've never seen' was shown in the theaters, my sister, brothers, in-laws and I went to see it.11 extra minutes..A spam? Especially to those who paid to see the original, cut version, purchased the VHS & DVD.Anyway, for those whom never seen The Exorcist and love a well-made horror movie, I suggest buying a copy.Turn out the lights, 'watch on a stormy night, if possible,' sit back and enjoy this great movie. You will be frightened.The Exorcist was made prior to high-technology. They literally 'worked' their butts off setting the haunting, devilish mood of this film. Example: In one scene, the room is supposed to be icy cold. They brought in 'X' amount of ice. The room was really cold. Steam emitted from characters mouths, making it genuine.After seeing The Exorcist the first time, 'at the show,' it took a week or longer before I had a decent night sleep. Also, priests were receiving daily calls from people who believed they or their children were possessed. lol. Toni
A1DRI4UVR82SI	0	0	What's happened to Paramount Pictures? And why do previews entice fans, make a movie look so entertaining you just have to see it?If I'd known The Devil Inside wasn't a movie, but someone holding a camera, jerking, to boot, I'd never have rented it. Thankfully, it was only 1.00. 1.00 lost.The errors!In the beginning it's stated Maria killed three people. While Isabella, 'Maria's daughter' is telling the story, she says her mother killed two people.I can't count the number of times the actors laughed during a serious scene. Probably didn't realized the 'one' camera was directed at them.Their laughter was contagious..felt like I was watching Bloopers.In one scene, Father David Keane is performing Baptism. In an earlier scene, he says he's in trouble with the church. Why then, would be be allowed to Baptize a baby???Stupidity!Father Keane cuts his wrist. There's blood everywhere. A second priest, Father Rawlings, has a baffled/dumb look on his face and mumbles, 'What should I do?' Duh, call for an ambulance or get the *ell out!The acting was awful and phony, the shaking camera gave me a headache, and the ending atrocious.People who like Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity might enjoy this film? Documentary? Whatever!!! And/or people who aren't bothered by mistakes.I'm actually happy I watched instead of buying the DVD. I'd really have a lot to complain about. Toni
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	My plants have been hooked on ST over 20-yrs, with excellent results. Healthy, vivid green foliage and long-lasting blooms.Dossage...4-drops per gallon of water. Newly purchased plants get 10-drops per gallon.I follow directions according to label when first purchased, 20+-yrs-ago.I do not mist/spray plants with Superthive.Superthrive is NOT a fertilizer...It's recommended to use with fertilizer.After reading feedback here on Amazon and other plant forums, I've noticed many people assume Superthrive is a fertilizer, in the process neglect adding plant food. Some plants can do without fertilizers for prolonged periods, (succulents) but others, espeically plants that require specific fertilizer types. EG: Acidic loving plants...Gardenia, ferns, etc, need nutrients. Flowering plants...Another example, old soil loses nutrients. Either repotting or ferilizing 'should' help the problem.Others, over/under ST their plants, then expect miracles.Like any product, excess can harm plants.In addition, ST does wonders with seedlings, cuttings and sick plants.Still skeptical? Experiment. Rooting cuttings is the most economical way. Pothos/Devil's Ivy is probably the best plant to experiment. Label plants A and B. Add ST and fertilizer to Plant A...fertilize to Plant B without ST.BTW, I live in a cold/grey climate therefore my plants are not fertilized during winter months, so for people who reside in cold areas, (unless you normally feed plants in winter,) this test is best done in spring, or during/after February depending on sunlight.Con: Price..Over the years, Superthive's price has sky-rocketed. Of course, if one buys online, searching for a reputable seller with reasonable prices saves $$.On the other hand, maybe cost increase is a good sign since it's been around 73-years.Pro: Works great and Long-lasting...1-pint of ST lasts 1-2 years. BTW, I have over 400 indoor plants that get a monthly dose.IMO, Superthive deserves 10-stars. Toni
A1DRI4UVR82SI	0	1	The New Adventures of Old Christine's Season 3 deserves 5-stars, but I gave it two because of so few episodes.Two DVD's, 10 episodes. Regular price, 34.99, on sale 24.99.What I'd like to know is the actual cost in the making of a DVD.Season 3's episodes are well-written, well-acted and hilarious.I love Julia-Louis Dreyfus. She's one of the funniest comedians of the 21st century. A newer version of Lucille Ball.The remaining cast members are excellent actors, too.Each character does a fantastic job, well-suited to their roles, in a family-type atmosphere.I recommend buying Season 3 especially if you're a die-hard Julia/Elaine/Christine fan..Prepare youself to watch the complete season at one sitting. Buy a smaller bag of popcorn. lol. Toni
A1DRI4UVR82SI	1	1	48 Hours is one of Eddie Murphy's Top Ten best films.Nick and Eddie are a hilarious team. Nick plays the stern cop, while Eddie, 'prisoner on 48-hour leave,' cracks jokes throughout the movie.Eddy's facial expressions are priceless, 'in all his movies.'Many laughs and action scenes.48-Hours was on TV last week, but between commercials and bleeps, I decided to buy the DVD.Amazon's Format description. 1-Star.As stated above, I was about to purchase 48 Hours, but first checked format, which read DVD.While viewing Comments, someone mentioned the movie was Blu Ray, not Region 1, DVD.I do not have nor want another player, including Blu Ray.Amazon should list the correct format. I hope an Amazon Employee reads this.The majority of my VHS and DVD's were purchased through Amazon, but if I cannot figure the correct format, 'because it's unlisted,' in the future my DVD's will be sought elsewhere.As far as the movie, 48 hours is an exceptional movie...a must have for Murphy fans.
A1DROF92J3EKAO	1	1	PT Cruiser Strong ArmsThey worked as described. I had to purchase a new tool to remove the four screws with star heads, but that was no big deal as I will likely use the tool at some future date. I have always been pleased with the products purchased through Amazon.com.D E Brooks

A1DRR166NGSCR7	0	1	In this catagory of books, Energetic Boundaries is the first audiobook that I have ever been able to say with complete confidence that "it did absolutely nothing for me but offend me". I especially did not appreciate Karla McLaren's judgement in CD 5 of: Dispelling the "all one" "myth". She may see it as a "myth" but that doesn't mean that it is a myth to ALL people. I even contacted the publishers of this audiobook (Sounds True) with my disappointment and they apologized and even sent me another audiobook CD set from another author of my choice free of charge.Karla often had a note of sarcasm and laughter in her tone of voice and at times reminded me of a person who was trying to please a crowd/audience rather than be authentic and real. Equality and respect for all was not part of her vocabulary and she reminded me of a person who felt like she was the teacher of a 1st grade class with an attitude like you were here to learn from HER the "correct" way, and that there was nothing for HER to learn from YOU. Right from the very beginning her approach was an "I'm going to make myself comfortable" approach with no kind of real invitation for the listener to interpret her "knowledge" however they felt comfortable with. It was basically a "this is my way" attitude with no real desire to ask "but what is yours" I did not feel any kind of genuine openness from her to see that not everyone connects with Spirit in the same way that she does and that some people might actually feel offended with her talk of Jesus Christ. She tried to come across like she was all inclusive of everyone's beleifs but her underlying message was based on a Christian viewpoint. And even if prayer is the "proper" way to begin a healing session for her, everyone does not connect with Spirit through the same kind of "prayer" that she does. I have a very strong connection with God but it is not a Christian God; and since it did not mention in the advertised description of this audiobook that she would be presenting this information from more of a Christian veiwpoint and from a more "I'm the teacher" approach, I did not appreciate her attitude and style of speaking or her sarcasm. I am more in line with Lynne McTaggart's Living the Field but I never invade someone's personal space like I felt Karla did for me with comments that implies that "this is the 'correct' way to do something". I feel like all people are unique and of value to the world, all of us have something special to contribute, not just one.
A1DRR166NGSCR7	1	1	Three's Company is my favorite TV show. I love all Three's Company seasons but especially these later episodes with Furley. I have all Three's Company DVD's and season's 6,7 and 8 have provided us with much laughter over the past several months. In tough times laughter can sometimes be great medicine and Three's Company is one show that receives a 10 star rating in my opinion. I especially love DVD's because you get all of the laughs without all of the annoying commercials! I would definitely reccommend this DVD series.
A1DRR166NGSCR7	1	1	I find this CD to be especially useful in assisting the mind to relax; the music is very nurturing and soothing and the sounds of nature help me with all of my meditation needs/wants. I would highly recommend this CD.
A1DRV090GB5U18	1	1	Great nonstick, Unbelievave seal between lid and pan, great handle, nice balance.
A1DRV090GB5U18	0	0	The worst of my three Anolon pans. Non-stick not as goo, drain spout in corner by handle, should have an assist handle for draining. Great grip, though!
A1DRV090GB5U18	1	1	Excellent so far. Have owned for two months. Comfortable grip, dishwasher safe - no complaints
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	I have to say that this is a great book for anyone who has just purchased their first home. If you are in a position where you have noone to depend on but yourself, get a copy. Although, a reviewer did pan the book, stating that it gave instructions on how to change a bulb, this is not the whole truth-the bulb that they are referring to in the book, is in your gas or electric oven-big difference. It gives details on how to ignite a pilot light on a water heater safely-( which, unfortunately, I have had to do twice )- and several other things that you may not even think about until it is too late. Better to buy the book, and familiarize yourself. Do you know how to shut off your gas supply in an emergency, or repair a leaking water tank on a Sunday, or worse, in the middle of the night? Where is your toolbox? Do you even have a tool box? I admit, I did'nt even consider these things before. Buying a house for the first time, most of us are knee deep in carpet samples, decorating books, and paint chips-and most of us don't focus on gas leaks, frozen pipes, broken toilets, clogged showers, or loss of hot water. Like a good scout, BE PREPARED!
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	Although I had been working out for years, my stamina for running was just not there. I researched several running books, and this was by far the best. If you are a beginner, and need the basics, get this book. Age should not be a factor, but as advised-have a physical before you embark on running. I am physically fit, I had never ran, and I did not start until I was 41. There are women who write that they did not even begin until they were in their 60's! The program instructs on how to incorporate running into your workout, starting with as little as 2 minutes! You can do that right? It covers how to choose the right running shoe, how to avoid injury, and what you need to eat in order to maintain stamina for the long haul. Carb's are important here, take note. Dagny covers it all, and speaks from experience. She even covers overcoming the initial &quot;embarassement&quot; of running for the first time, and how to enter your first 5K and finish. I love this book, and still refer to it.

Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years. She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her. Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public. Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	I happened upon this book at a yard sale, and took it home to read--it had to be over 20 years ago. I have NEVER forgotten this book---it is so shocking, and so twisted-you have to read it to believe it-even by todays standards. I do not know whatever happened to Craig Jones, or to that book, but I will tell you this-I have never read anything that impacted me in quite the same way. I have to agree with the reviewer who titled his/her review holy ****, because that just about explains it all!
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	This a great read-period! I had never been interested in reading western novels-but due to its popularity, I decided to try it. I, too, stayed up into the wee hours reading that one more page. I took the book to the gym, to the park, any place where I knew I would get a few minutes to pick up where I last left off. The reviewer that wrote that this book is the quickest 900 pages that you may ever read-could not have been more accurate. It is a very special book.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	There are several reviews regarding this book that follow, which actually gives the plot away, not only for Streets of Loredo-but for Lonesome Dove as well!! REVIEWERS TAKE NOTE: IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS THE KEY PLOTS IN A REVIEW! PERIOD!As far as Streets is concerned it is a good book-although not up to the Lonesome Dove, in my opinion. McMurtry is still a great writer, and this book proves not to be an exception.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	I happened upon the Accidental Quilters list of favorite quilt books-and thank goodness!! She spotlighted this book, and I ordered it immediately for several reasons-but mostly because I was a beginning quilter, and the artist in me bulked at the thought of making a cookie cutter quilt-regardless of whether it would be my first or my fiftieth! I appreciate the time and talent that goes into making a quilt from a pattern, but that is just not me. Thank you Accidental Quilter, thank you Gwen Marsten! Fabulous!!
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	I love my Breadman machine, and use it twice a week to bake bread. Very convenient, easy to clean. The difference between homemade bread, and store bought--no contest! I wondered what made me wait so long, to buy this machine. I have since bought one for my father as a birthday gift. I love to make pizza dough with this machine, as well as flavored breads.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	As usual the UK has produced and delivered a series that puts to shame anything that American television has to offer. Helen Mirren is ranked one of the world's best actors-and for good reason.I have all of the DVD's in the Prime Suspect series, having watched them first on public television's ExxonMobil Theatre. If you are one of those who make deliberate choices based on quality, then do not miss this series. It is one of, if not THE best, that television has to offer.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	Anne Perry is at the top of her game as a mystery novelist-and her true genius shows as editor of this creative endeavor! Quite clever to expand on the Dickens Classics-each writer who contributes shines-and it allows readers to sample the cream of the crop. Great read, makes a wonderful gift for the classics collector, and mystery lover!
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	If you are any of the above, you will find this guide useful. Whether you are a solitary caver, or even if you would like to introduce young members of your family to caving, this is a good place to start. There are a range of caves to explore listed in this guide, and each are unique and individual, appealing to all types from the beginner to the expert. Easy read, and fits perfect in a backpack or overnight bag.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	My daughter received this bike while vacationing at her grandparents. It was easy to put together and she really loves riding it. The accessory's are fun too!
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	0	0	I am a GVS fan, and I watch On The Record as often as I can. However, an accomplished lawyer/commentator does not a writer make. This book was not edited,(well or otherwise), and it shows in the first few pages when you realize that Greta has overused the word FUN....over, and over, and over. It is bland and boring. The fact that she had assistance in writing it is even more of an insult.Check it out of your local library-or skip it altogether.
A1DRYQ7RKDC3WP	1	1	Growing up, my best friend Beth and I would have reading contests to see who could read the most Nancy Drew books over the summer! We would go to the library every week-sometimes more than once. Reading Nancy Drew was fun back then-and has remained contemporary. This movie is great-Emma Roberts is SO sweet and cute playing the part of Nancy. The storyline was fast paced and well written. My daughter and I have been anxiously waiting for the DVD release. Some of the 'tween movies are just too awful to sit through-but this movie is the exception to the rule. Enjoyable for kids and parents alike.
A1DSJTUX51DEF0	1	1	I have read both Stieg Larson and Jo Nesbo and wanted to read an Islandic book. It is a good book. However starts out a bit slow, but it does gather speed towards the end. In the end it was a fairly satisfying read. Probably not enough to pick up another in the series.
A1DSJTUX51DEF0	1	1	The Yellow Emperor Classic is a great book and necessary for any practitioner of Chinese Medicine. The book was in excellent condition and arrived in good shape
A1DSJTUX51DEF0	1	0	This is a good Qi Gong CD. However there should be a warning at the beginning of it that people who are just starting out should do just 15 min in the beginning to strengthen their legs. 1/2 hour with legs bent is long for someone not experienced.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	0	1	I feel compelled to write a stern warning about this book. I was excited to order it to help out my twin daughters - born 2 months premature. My jaw hit the floor when I read the very dangerous misinformation in the first couple of chapters. The author begins with a criticism of hospitals' handling of newborns. He states that nurseries should be made more like the womb to comfort babies, kept moist and at 90 degrees. He then states that the only reason that babies are put on their backs is so that nurses can tell if they are still breathing, and recommends that babies sleep on their stomachs.This is all good advice if you want your baby to be at significant risk of death from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome(SIDS). First, the only safe position for babies to sleep on is their back. The author seems to believe that SIDS is only caused babies smothering themselves with blankets - this is not (although smothering is always a risk. Current reccomendations are to keep healthy babies' environments on the cool side (68 deg F.). One of the major causes of SIDS is apnea due to immaturity in the brain stem. Current sleep reccomenadtions are designed to alleviate this.Not even incubators are kept at 90 degrees. When babies are born, they go through physical changes - such as separation from the placenta. They have the largest dose of hormones running through their bodies that they will ever have in their lifetime. Very quickly, healthy babies are able to regulate their own temperature - they are mammals and not snakes after all.Infants in intensive care units are sometimes put to sleep on their stomachs - but they are connected to heart and respiration monitors that alarm when they stop breathing or their heart-rate drops.I am completley shocked that someone billed as a child development expert has absolutely no knowledge of the risk of SIDS. Granted, back-sleeping is not the best thing for physical development, which is where there are exercise programs to compensate for this. Tummy time is important while baby is awake and supervised.Please do not follow the newborn advice in this book. I can't get past this, and maybe there's good advice in the rest of the book.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I just got this DVD and have only tried a couple of the exercises. The first thing that strikes me is that Sonnon demonstrates beginning to advanced levels of each exercise. I think that most people (even who are out of shape) can do at least the beginning level exercises. The more advanced exercises will pose a challenge to many. One of my problems with yoga has always been that it is very difficult for beginners to do correctly. Some teachers may be good at helping people along, and there are props, but it can be so challenging that beginners who aren't flexible and strong already drop out.The introduction to the DVD is really important and not fluff at all. I particularly love the way Sonnon draws a distinction between discomfort, effort, and correct form. I think confusion around this is why many of my friends have injured themselves in the gym.I think a lot of people in the US also neglect areas of fitness - focusing on building muscle without flexibility or working cardio to the detriment of muscle. Don't even get me started on the women who do endless thigh adductor exercises and do rapid tiny steps on stairclimbers - the muscle imbalances they are creating will bite many of them some day. Fitness, as defined academically by sports medicine professionals, includes strength, body composition, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and coordination. I think this program is well suited to work on each area of fitness.Beyond the academic definitions of fitness there is the promised shortcut to reaching the flow state - as laid out by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This is where you become absorbed into what you are doing and reach a state of peak performance. While I have yet to work with the exercises in this video at length, I believe the combination of breathing practice, yogic exercise, and focus on internal states are a good way to reach flow. Sonnon suggests that working out 14-18 minutes with this program at the proper level of effort is enough to access the flow state and achieve a positive endocrine-immune system response. This is an absolutely reasonable assertion provided one follows the mental and physical suggestions given. It may takke a few sessions of learning the exercises before this is possible - but everything worthwhile takes effort.I plan on working with the exercises along with my normal martial arts practice over the next few months. I am attracted to bodyweight-based exercises that build strength. I don't really like the gym experience and have always seen lifting weights as a necessary evil.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	0	0	I purchased this router to replace another wireless router that kept dropping connections. Upon opening the box I was greeted with a big warning sticker that said "Run CD before plugging in router!" OK - so I ran through the install instructions with the CD and I could literally never connect to the Internet and my laptop wouldn't see the network. I tried for about 6 hours, running through every set of troubleshooting instructions I could find. I finally gave up completely and returned the router.Now, even though I uninstalled the Linksys software - the wireless settings on my laptop get changed about 3 minutes after I boot up, preventing me from connecting to my current network. The only software I have installed is Linksys install - so it is clear that there is something still resident in my system that is rendering my laptop incapable of connecting to any wireless network.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	This movie has it all: swashbuckling action, intrigue, romance, mind control, and Orson Welles. Wells plays the historical figue Joseph Balsamo, who later styles himself Count Cagliostro (a la the Count of Monte Christo). Balsamo was a poor Sicilian con man who wheedled his way into many a royal court in Europe before finally getting arrested by the Inquisition in Rome. This movie is very fictionalized account of the infamous "affair of the necklace", a controversy involving Marie Antoinette.Welles delivers a stunning performance as the anti-hero/anti-villain Cagliostro who uses flim flam and the power of suggestion (like Mesmer) to gain power over people. Notably, Raymond Burr plays a small role in the film (look for him in the first few minutes of the movie.The sets, costumes, and cinematography are stunning - making for a wonderful period piece. The cinematography is very good, despite the fact that Welles didn't direct this film. The film is black and white and, I believe, orginally released in 1949My biggest complaint is that I have only been able to find this film on VHS tape from 1987. My copy is in good shape, but the film begs to be re-released on DVD.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	This is a great little tool, compact and powerful. It's useful anywhere you need a little bit of UV light. I can see stores keeping one behind a register to quickly check currency (US paper currency has markings that flouresce under UV light). Most state IDs and credit cards also have UV markings that are hard to counterfeit. Mechanics can use this to check for leaks in your AC (when phosporescent die si introduced to the system). Forensic document examiners may use this to check for differences in ink.It's inexpensive, highly portable, and works well. If you need a limited UV light, this is the tool for you.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	This book outlines a system of personal improvement developed by dr. John Kappas, founder of the Hypnosis Motivation Institute. The late Dr. Kappas was a pioneer in creating a working model of suggestibility and hypnosis that works extremely well.This particular system was refined over many years. It's not difficult to do, but it's not easy either. You have to work in your ledger for a few minutes every day. (By the way, do yourself a favor and order a couple of ledgers to go along with this book -The Mental Bank Ledger)If you do this diligently you will start to notice many small changes in yoru life. Those small changes compund and snowball over time and become big changes. This isn't magic or mumbo-jumbo, it is behavioral science.In his practice, Dr. Kappas recognized that many people fail to change or revert to old behaviors because homeostasis is an overpowering drive. We don't often venture out of our comfort zone. Worse yet is when we push out of teh comfort zone and slingshot back to old behaviors. The Mental Bank is a practice which is designed to create a small bit of momentum to expand the comfort zone, and create new behaviors. It overcomes homeostasis and allows the new desired behaviors to become your comfort zone.You can make more mone, lose weight, whatever you want. Again, there is effort, it's about 5 minutes a day right before you go to sleep.The timing is also important, because it will stimulate the problem solving mechanisms in the deram cycle. Have you ever woken up with the solution to a problem after "sleeping on it"? This is designed to take advantage of the brain's organizing activities during sleep.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	Ledochowsky is an excellent hypnotist, as I have listened to many recordings of him. He is steeped in the Ericsonian and NLP traditions. What is very nice about this book is that it covers both Ericsonian and traditional hypnotic techniques. What many Ericsonian hypnotists miss is that even Ericson disn't always do Ericsonian hypnosis - some people respond better to a more authoritarian approach.Of note in this book is the coverage of "suggestibility tests". Suggestibility tests are actually done to induce or deepen trance, they are a proof and expectation building exercise and create conscious overload. This book contains a wide variety of them. All hypnotists should have a few of these under their belt.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	There's a reason why Chris Walken has an open invitation to host SNL any time he wants - the guy is hilarious! Certainly one of America's quirkiest actors, Walken delivers comedy in his typical deadpan style. There's just something about his delivery that makes him all the funnier.Of course this DVD contains the infamous "more cowbell" sketch. However, it also contains one of my all-time favorite sketches featuring Tim Meaddows taking a census from Walken: Meaddows: "How long have you lived here?" Walken: "It's hard to say, what time is it?"Also featured is the racy "Colonel Angus" sketch which had me in stiches.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	As a 'Yank', this album was my first exposure to Augie March, and I'm happy to have found them. Lead singer Glenn Richards is to be commended both for writing all the music and for his and entrancing vocals. I think this album will be a great introduction to US audiences/Far from Pop or rock, there are overtones of Dylan and Orbison in here. The instrumentation is relatively acoustic with little processing. the vocals are clean. Richards' songs are poems set to music, no bubblegum lyrics here folks.I was sold on the first track - "One Crowded Hour." It's got a nice feel, like you are sitting in a small venue at the foot of the stage.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I have read a lot of books and articles about Stargate, but the majority of the material here was a surprize to me. How did this all start? What were the early days like? Why did the CIA pull the plug? What kind of results were they really getting?The history is exhaustive, with many exact dates names and locations. However, the book is not dry at all. A nice touch is Major Smith's own story woven in. Yes history is about people.There's a great section in the beginning that calls to task the so-called skeptic James Randi, and how his research is flawed, slanted, inaccurate, and often made-up. The book mentions specific falsehoods and areas where Randi just made stuff up to support his point. This is ironic because the psychic research is strongly controlled here while Randi is guilty of the falsehoods he projects on all things paranormal.RV works. The book cites a lot of research, some published in per-reviewed journals. There's an amazing comment from a peer-reviewer who didn't want a study to appear in the IEEE journal who said something like, "I don't care if it is real, I don't want to believe it." This gives you an idea of what so-called legit science does with research outside it's accepted box.Major Smith has written a great history of the psychic spying program. Cold War buffs will find it fascinating. Paranormal researchers should find it fascinating. Anyone who likes a good story will enjoy it.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I keep this legal dictionary at my right hand on my desk and refer to it almost daily. It is a perferct legal dictionary for non-lawyers.I'm not a lawyer, but have been involved with litigation as a plaintiff and am training as an expert witness. Sometimes it's helpful to know what "voir dire" and "subpoena duces tecum" mean. Even for somebody who's studied Latin and French, lawyers sometimes pronounce things differently than you'd expect - and this dictionary has helped.I also appreciate having a copy of the constitution in the back, as well as a guide to the judicial system. Included is a bare-bones outline of criminal and civil procedure which will be helpful for the layperson. The appendix also has lists of important cases and important laws (can you remember Marbury vs. Madison from high school civics?).I know thatBlack's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition (Black's Law Dictionary (Standard Edition))is the standard, but you can't beat this dictionary for its price, size, and coverage.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	0	0	I debated giving this one or two stars. I chose two due to the sheer number of images included, many of which are of historical interest.My overall impression of the book is that the author looked up some modes of recognition (signs) used by freemasons and then went through thousands of pictures of famous people, choosing those that caught the person making a gesture vaguely resembling the sign. People who aren't freemasons or illuminati (the same thing according to this author) sometimes steeple their hands, shake hands, and hold a hand on their hip. This does not equal a sign.Masonic signs are not simple static postures, but involve very specific movements. It is always unclear from a still photo whether a person is making a sign.Anyone who knows about freemasonry knows that freemasons generally do not want to be photographed making masonic signs. Most freemasons would not make their signs so openly, or specifically to be photographed. There are oaths to keep such things sacred.The book also suffers from anti-masonic and anti-semitic bigotry. I'm sure that many learned religious scholors would take offense to the authors referral to Kabbalah as "Jewish black magic".The factual errors are also astonishing. I wasn't even born when the first moon landing occurred, and yet I know that Buzz Aldrin was not the first person on the moon (as the author states).While there may be some overlap between the historical Illuminati and the freemasons, the two are not the same. This suggestion comes mostly from far-right fundamentalist Christians who disagree with any organization involved with spiritual education that does not force it's members to accept Christ as personal savior. Freemasonry requires only a belief in God, while Illuminism essentially was anti-religious.The author (like so many other fundamentalist propagandists) try to tie Freemasonry and Illuminism to devil-worship. Again, the idea is that anything occult (hidden) is black-magic, anthing that is non-christian is devil worship.Some of the photos here might be of leaders who were signalling membership in a secret society. However, those pictures are lost in a sea of falsehood. Also, we don't necessarily know which secret society (there are many).
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I really like this, and found it quite easy to set up. I have lights in my bedroom and kids' room set up, so I can turn them on from the living-room (or anywhere else in the house).I understand that there are other add-on modules for this system, which I may decide to experiment with.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	0	0	I like Sci Fi. I Like animation. I like low-brow comedy. This should have been a movie I loved, right? Eh.First, the writing was poor. The vast majority of the jokes were predictable, hackneyed, and cliche. There was a loose plot line, which went mostly out the window for the major subplots. The subplots were basically three movie/tv parodies loosely scrapped together without much coherence.Of course, the box makes a big to-do over the fact that this is an unrated filth-fest. What they mean by this is that there is a lot of gratuitous swearing. I mean gratuitous in the real sense of the word - swearing for no apparent reason.I'm no prude but the swearing seemed to be shoehorned into the dialogue to provide shock value (which it didn't). How many times can you hear a character slap the f-word in front of the subject of his sentence before it becomes boring? Well, you're going to get that a lot. A good comedy writer could have a field day with flinging insults between characters, which makes it disappointing when they mostly fling standard expletives at each other.The comedic timing is way off (mostly too slow), and the dialogue seems cobbled together. I'm guessing the voice actors each recorded their lines separately and the sound editor did what he could to put them together.The CG animation is good and visually very interesting.The "star studded" voice cast includes "stuttering" John Melendez and Jenny McCarthy.The DVD extra is "Making of Tripping the Rift". This is nothing more than a couple of very short interviews with the voice actors.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	0	1	Sure, this DVD features a lot of comedians. However, the DVD description reads as if the comedians are performing. They are not.This is a talk show hosted by D-list celeb host Byron Alen. It features a panel of comedians delivering obviously pre-written lines about uninteresting topics of discussion.I would love to have seen clips of standup from the likes of Howie Mandell and the rest - but alas, it's not here. This is just clips of a (I assume) syndicated late night talk show you're likely to see on basic cable when you have insomnia and don't want to watch another infomercial for Kevin Trudeau's "Secrets of Ripping-Off Consumers They Don't want You to Know About."
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	A pornographer and political radical have some lude pictures of Princess Maragaret and using them to blackmail the crown. They are held in a safe deposit box in a bank. The spooks use a beautiful woman with a criminal past to recruit some low-level thieves to break into the bank and rifle the safe-deposit box vault, only they can't know what the real objective is.This is not your typical adrenaline-fueled Jason Statham, car-chase pic. There is some action, lots of intrigue, and a bit of romance. It's a fun yet serious caper movie with several plot twists to keep you interested along the way.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	There is no, well very little, action or romance here. The movie is essentially and intellectual exploration of what it would be like for someone who lived for 14,000 years. Don't let that read as boring, because it is not at all.What would it really be like to live for 14,000 years? Would you learn a bunch of languages and forget them after you haven't used them for a hundred or so years? Would you be able to identify yourself as a Cro-Magnon man after the phrase has been coined?John is a college professor who has decided to quit his job and gathers up his friends at his cabin for a going away party. Over some nice Scotch he reveals a captivating story of a live that has lasted 140 centuries.Do they believe him? Is he lying? Is he crazy? Is it some weird thought experiment? Or, is he telling the truth?What is his take on the Christ and Buddha? On man? The environment?I really enjoyed watching this thought-provoking movie. It's got an independent flavor, but is very accessible.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I am a big fan of Pimsleur programs, and have done Japanese I-III and French I. The Italian I is the same high-quality program with the revolutionary teaching style. I have tried a number of programs to learn languages, and Pimsleur is still my favorite.The nice thing about this method, in my opinion, is that it focuses on real working conversation. The memory technique is excellent, in my expereince. I wish high-school language programs worked this way rather than memorizing rules and vocabulary lists. I don't need to know the name of a tense in order to use it. When I speak in English, I don't consider such things, I just speak.If you want to learn to read and write the language, a good way to do it is go through this program first and then look to additional instruction. Once you are already putting sentences together, writing them is so much easier.I highly recommend going through each level more than once - taking a break between listenings. Repetition is a key in the program, an dgoing through the stuff again will only reinforce it.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	Whether or not you believe two ascended beings teleported into the authors living room or not, this book contains cutting-edge spiritual wisdom. The heart of the material is truth that is at home with New Thought, Gnosticism, Advaita Vedanta and other systems.My warning to you is that reading this with an open mind will change you. Just toying with the powerful ideas presented here will start to undo your ego.Lapsed Christians may find the teachings about Jesus refreshing as Paulist dogma is stripped away so that the real lessons of Christ can be highlighted. Fundamentalists will be offended as Jesus is shown as a peer, and not an intermediary standing in the way of God's light,The book works well in parallel withA Course in Miraclesor, I believe, on it's own. Readers who are daunted by the sheer size of ACIM might start with this book as a bridge to it's teaching.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	Flip this book open to any page and you find beautiful prose which reveals spiritual truths, taken fromA Course in Miracles. Want to know what ACIM has to say about a specific topic (like ego) just flip to that section for a substantial snippet which captures the message.I like to keep this on on my desk and just pick it up a few times of day to real a little. Like those who get a caffeine pick-me-up every couple of hours, I get a spiritual wisdom pick-me up.It's a nice feature that the book contains an extensive reference list, so that ACIM readers can find the quotes later and read them in full-context.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I was looking for a new juicer that would make prep and cleanup easier (two biggest problems with juicing in my opinion)and this machine did the trick. While it is not noisier than other juicers, you can sense how powerful it is when you turn it on.Drop your favorite fruits and veggies in and this thing gets more juice out of them than any juicer I've tried. The pulp you're left with is nearly dry.The mess is minimal as the pulp stays inside instead of being spit out. Cleanup is very easy. I also like the width of the opening so I don't have to chop things up too much.Health benefits aside, nothing compares to the taste of fresh juice. Juice one pineapple, and you'll never go back to the acidic stuff they sell in the store. Throw some veggies in with an apple and get a nice tasting and easy way to get your vitamins.This unit is a tremendous value - I highly recommend it.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	0	I am a martial artist with over 30 years experience (none in ninjutsu, Bujinkan or otherwise). When I first read this book I gave it two stars - that was a few years ago. I thought, "who is the guy with the huge ego writing this disjointed nonsense?" But I've recently been led to re-read the book and have given it five stars. Why?Well, first is that the collection of information here is not to be found in any other one source. I too think that the ultimate goal for martial arts is spiritual development (since we're all going to die someday). The author writes with startling candor about topics that many masters just never speak about.Certainly he is opinionated, has deep respect for Hatsumi-san, and has drunk the proverbial Bujinkan Kool-aid. Reading past that, the information is very good.This is not an instruction manual for those looking to pick up some ninja techniques, but is to be real like looking for tracks in the wilderness. There are landmarks to be found here, warnings of dangers, and encouragement to find the rest of the picture.Who knows why I couldn't read it before - perhaps I just wasn't ready. I've gotten a lot from a second reading as my path has intersected that of the late Dr. Morris.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	0	We recently bought a house which is on a septic system, and one of the suggestions for keeping the septic in order was to avoid using chlorine bleach. The chlorine kills bacteria necessary for the septic to process waste material. The majority of commercially available dishwasher powders contain chlorine bleach, and who knows what else.Biokleen's dish powder contains and oxygenating bleach and its biodegradable. That makes me happy. What also makes me happy is that the product works exceptionally well - our dishes are very clean. It's concentrated, so one tub lasts for 64 washes. I also enjoy the smell - it has a very slight citrus scent. I find most dish powders to leave the dishes smelling like grandma's perfumed soap.I highly recommend this product and will only be using this from here on out.

A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	0	Living in the backwoods, I was not surprised one day when my in-laws hunted me down and shot me in the torso with a hunting rifle. The wound was painful and I was losing a lot of blood. I was afraid I wouldn't make it out of the woods and back to my dung-hut alive.I remembered that I was carrying a copy of this life saving book in the burlap sack I use as clothing and to carry puppies. Quickly scanning the contents I set out to cure myself of chronic gunshot wound to the torso.I drank about a gallon of my own salty waste, and lo and behold - I was completely cured. I walked out of the woods a new man with no signs of the gaping bloody wound which had plagued me earlier.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	0	This high-quality Nolo guide is a basic primer on taxation for small business. It covers everything from the basics to more advanced topics.The book starts out by defining what things are taxable and what things are deductible. It goes over what kinds of records to keep and where you can claim losses (depending upon your business type). If you don't come from an accounting background - this will save you a lot of time and perhaps money.Advanced topics include retirement accounts, buying and selling a business, and how to deal with audits.You may still need an accountant, but you can lessen your dependence on an expensive professional by learning the basics.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	As usual, Nolo hits it out of the park with the small business owner in mind.Proper records keeping is a legal requirement. Not having proper records of meetings, for example, is one way a small business can lose liability protection in court. Nolo really helps here by providing all the necessary forms and instructions.honestly, the greatest value for this book is that it contains all the forms on a CD so you can pront out whatever you need. This alone will save you time and money worth many times the cost of the book.
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I have recently lost over 60 pounds following theThe Dukan Diet: 2 Steps to Lose the Weight, 2 Steps to Keep It Off Forever. A component of that diet is daily oat bran.We've tried a couple of different brands, but we like Bob's Red Mill the best. Both the flavor and texture are superior, and I like that it's organic. I also like the company - having seen them profiled in the news. They treat their employees well and even basically gave partial ownership to their workers.For use with the Dukan diet, I find the easiest and tastiest way to prepare is to put two tablespoons in a bowl, pour in just enough skim milk to cover, then microwave for about 60 seconds. I add in organic cinnamon (cinnamon is good for blood sugar).
A1DSRM2P0WGQNS	1	1	I'm a bit of a collector and a self defense instructor. When looking for a fixed blade knife for a bugout bag, this came highly recomended.At over a hundred bucks less expensive than many competitors it was hard not to buy it. What a pleasant surprise when I got it.The knife is solid, a tad heavy, but this is good in a survival implement. The blade is thick and, though not full tang, solid in the handle. In a survival environment, you need a tool that can cut, chop, pry, carve, etc. This knife is up to the task.The sheath is just great. The blade is held very securely in place. You could mount the sheath upside-down, say on a backpack shoulder strap, without worry the knife will slip out. It has a handy built-in sharpener, and holes for mounting multiple ways.The knife itself has lashing points so that it could be turned into a spear. The pommel (butt-cap) is a pointed piece of steel suitable for breaking glass or a cranium.The Kraton handle is non-slip, and feels good in the hand.This knife would be a good deal at double the price.
A1DTIXUVOXNCZ8	1	1	People need to read Korten because our very future as free human beings is at stake. What he describes is nothing short of a fascistic world system in which huge, private, unaccountable corporations trump nation-states that are at least in part accountable to their citizens.There is no doubt that the political process has its flaws and that even democratically elected governments can end up being illiberal (see Fareed Zakaria, "The Future of Freedom"), but once the world treaty system and national constitutions and laws are aligned to give the corporate form clear advantages over human rights, it's all over for us. It's vitally important that we not let this happen.When Corporations Rule the World provides heavily documented evidence that trends are strongly against the survival of the sort of democratic republic that most Americans still think we live under.I place this book at the top of the reading list that I provide my graduate Economics students.
A1DTIXUVOXNCZ8	1	1	Professor Massey has shared with readers his many years of in depth, primary research on the subject of Mexican immigration. Every policymaker and every American should read it.
A1DTIXUVOXNCZ8	0	0	The songs on the CD are not really sung by the original singers. A disappointing buy. The music is barely tolerable. Fortunately I didn't pay much for it.
A1DTKE8GTCGPHG	0	0	I would stay away from this book. This book is very inaccurate, and it is poorly written. "Everybody knows that Lisa Lopes moved to Atlanta by herself, and that she met T-boz through Rico Wade not some nightclub. If you want to know the real story about Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes get the VH1 Behind The Music "TLC" and the Left Eye Tribute in S2S magazine.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Clara, Jennie and Leonie Jerome are 3 sisters born of privilege in America between 1851 and 1859. They all marry British men and all suffer the ups and downs of uncertain fortunes. Jennie marries into the Churchill family and is mother to Winston. Her husband dies of syphilis and she will marry twice more and have countless affairs. Leslie marries into the wealth Irish Leslie family and bears 4 sons. Clara marries (for love) Moreton Frewen who never succeeds in any of his business ideas.I get that these were important people, but I could have done without the laundry-list name-dropping in every chapter. The book was over 400 pages, but could have been half the size, just as informative and twice as entertaining. I struggled with the last third of the book because there was no development of the women there. Plus, how many more money conversions (of that time to present day value) can one person take?
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	0	Samantha Joyce is 26 and the healthcare advisor to a Senator from her home state of Ohio. She is lovingly naive, clumsy and makes embarrassing mistakes. She end-up dating a rival senator's speech writer who cheats on her. She sends a sexy message via e-mail but hits "reply all" and ends up the subject of a Post article. She winds-up on the road when her senator is tapped for the VP spot and witnesses her ex's downfall firsthand. She eventually is in the White House with her (now VP) boss, a new boyfriend (the Post reporter) and manages to send one more mortifying e-mail (saying "pubic" instead of "public") before the story ends.When I grabbed this book, I didn't realize it was Al Gore's daughter who wrote it. Then, it became really obvious when the book went into policy discussions. The story - getting beyond any subliminal messages - is great. Sam is a realistic character and has real life experiences. The political aspect is interesting and has an inside feel without getting boringly technical. Some of the language seemed forced - as if Kristen wanted you to really know she went to Harvard - but she certainly wrote about what she knew and RG was not a carbon-copy of her dad!
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Rachel and David are getting married. Seems simple enough, but first they have to overcome her cheap father, obnoxious stepmother, melodramatic mother, his 1950's thinking parents, unenthusiastic friends , meddling relatives and then find their own meaning in a Jewish ceremony. Rachel eventually pulls off a wonderful event, full of personal touches and special acknowledgments to family and friends. She also grows closer to David and learns to accept all her family (and in-laws) for who they are.I read this while planning my own wedding and thought it very fitting. I was relieved to know that things could be worse - at least I didn't have any parent problems or the issue of kosher versus non-kosher or kosher-style. I think the book drifted off near the end with the author's need to tie everything up in a neat bow of an ending. The last part is a detail of the wedding video, given very short-shrift in comparison to the actual event.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	Ginny Young is on a cross-country flight to meet her sister Sharla and both will then see the mother they haven't talked to in 35 years. While on the flight, Ginny thinks back to the year she was 11 and Jasmine moved next door - the same year her mother left. We learn of the severe pain she and Sharla (then 13) went through trying to keep themselves together and grasp what was happening. In the end, the girls have made peace with their mother, now dying of ovarian cancer, and they catch-up on over 30 years of events and memories together.This is a really good example of a flash-back novel. You can sympathize with Marion, who feels trapped in the routine of her own family. However, you are also drawn into Steven's story - blind to the problems of his marriage, but a sweet and caring husband and father. Most of all, you understand Sharla's need to hate and ignore Marion for what she did and Ginny's total inability to hate her and desperation to understand what happened. The ending is cheesy, but getting there is good!
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	In Communist China in 1961, a boy is born as the 6th of 7 to a peasant family. When 11, he is taken from his family and studies in Beijing at Madame Mao's Academy of Dance. He is brainwashed into the Communist way of life for the next 7 years. On a trip to American where he studies with the Houston Ballet for a year, he defects. He does not see his parents for another 7 years and only returns to see the rest of his family after 9. By this time, he is a famous and successful dancer and is married to a Catholic ballerina!A truly fascinating book. To read about Communist China in the 1970's from a first person account is as close as you can get to being there. Li makes his story so engaging and real that you come away with a feeling of triumph rather than pity or sorrow for his experiences. There is a great capacity for empathy in him that is transferred to the reader. You don't hate China - you grow to understand the problems the government faced.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	0	Jocasta Perry is a female playboy. She adopts the "love 'em and leave 'em" attitude towards men, which seems to fit into her hectic and hip life as a TV producer in London. She comes up with a new reality show called "Sex with an Ex" and things take off. Then, she meets Darren Smith, who refuses to be a contestant on the show and her world is turned upside down. The girl who never gets attached finds herself in love, in denial, in pain, and finally, stabbed in the back by her production assistant in a plot involving Darren.Cheesy - with a side of Velveeta to boot. Issie is predictable, Fiona is horrible, Bales is a stereotype, Darren is unrealistic and basically retarded to keep coming back. Josh is a puzzle turned pathetic with the whole marriage proposal and Cas is a true moron. 33 year olds have NO excuse to act the way she does. Not to mention the boring, descriptive pages on Whitby and the Museum. Garbage!!!!
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Darcy has always been the popular, pretty girl who has it all. Then, weeks before her wedding to Dex, she admits her affair with groomsman Marcus, discovers Dex was cheating with maid of honor Rachel and then finds out she is pregnant. After things with Marcus dissolve, she flees to London to crash with her childhood friend Ethan. With her life in tatters, Darcy is forced to make major life changes and she finds happiness with Ethan, makes amends with Rachel (who marries Dex) and has her twin boys.Although I am all for a story where the pretty girl eats crow, this story was too over-the-top. No one carrying twins would go from a 4 to only a 6 at 5 months along. No one at 30 who spends like Darcy could go for 8 months without working and still buy designer clothing and fly business class to London. Ethan would never fall for Darcy given their history. Someone as selfish as Darcy never would have had the babies in the first place and Marcus was just too stereotypically lame.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	The subtitle of this book drew me in. The authors interviewed women who had either gone through affairs or were thinking of it and picked 26 of the stories to label A-Z to illustrate the many faces of infidelity. Each woman has a different reason for her actions and a different outcome. The authors don't judge the women, merely present their stories in each woman's own words, allowing the reader to take from the story what she will.Completely fascinating from cover to cover. Given the television shows out there like "Desperate Housewives", the topic is always relevant. Anyone could read the book, yet no two people will take away the same things. Each story creates new emotion, whether hate, sympathy, wondering why the woman ever married or despair that she would never find true love. One thing was constant, my complete resolution not to repeat these mistakes!
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	0	Walter White is a man with a true mission. Part black, he was born without any trace of this race on his skin or in his features. As an employee of the NAACP in its early years, he uses this "ability" to go under-cover in the South and investigate lynchings. He faces grave danger from both communities and struggles with the concept of the greater good. Along the way he is attracted to a white girl and black girl, has to rescue a racist man from drowning and barely makes it out of town when he is discovered.This was a train wreck from the start. Walter's story is try and fascinating, but the fictional rendering of events of 3 days is boring, trite, insulting, employs ridiculous stereotypes and cliches, is full of characters serving no purpose and others who are under-developed and ridden with silly philosophical mini-soliloquys of Walter - with no end message to walk away with. People should read an autobiography or historical book on the NAACP instead of this drivel.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	Jane McGregor is a 28 year old living in Chicago and working for a major office supplier designing pink slips. Then, she is laid-off. She is faced with $28,000 in debt, a landlord who uses her loose rental arrangement to fuel his gambling problem, parents about to divorce, a weird thing for her brother's best friend and - to top it all off - her new roommate hatches a plan to get revenge on their former employer and her ex lands her in jail after trashing her place. In the end, Jane gets the guy a new job and finally grows up.Although I think the author only threw in so many plot twists because she couldn't come up with enough to say about the main story, this was a pretty enjoyable read. I like that Jane had to face some real problems and had to deal with her debt in a realistic manner. I'm also glad Kyle acted like a real guy and not some ideal who never loses his temper or patience. I also liked a Chicago story instead of yet another chick lit book set in NYC.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	This was the first in the "Ya-Ya" series. We flash back and forth from the 60's to the 90's and learn of the Walker family through the eyes of the parents, Shep and Vivienne and their kids, Sidalee, Little Shep, Lulu and Baylor as well as their maid Willetta and her husband Chaney. All the adventure, dysfunction, local color, booziness and general mayhem is conveyed little by little, through memory or through present-day experience and we also learn of the Ya-Ya's - the girls Vivienne grew-up with and is still close to.I must admit that I don't have a good memory of the movie. That could be a good thing because I loved the book - from the style of one chapter in a given person's voice to the the content of each chapter. You couldn't hate Vivi, but despised what she did to the kids. You pitied Shep, but wanted him to rescue the kids. All were believable, complex and well0developed, worthy of the sequel.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	A story of three sisters in Ireland - Nessa, the eldest who is married to Adam and has an 8 year old daughter, Jill. Cate is the successful career woman, living with media star, Finn. Bree is the tomboy, working as a mechanic and never seeming to settle down. All their lives are thrown for a loop - or two, when Cate finds herself pregnant, Nessa finds Adam has multiple women on the side and Bree finds an ex's father is interested in her! The girls turn to each other and eventually sort things out - with lots of laughs in between.A clever twist to the familiar combination of sisters as a basis for a book. I was a bit disappointed that the book ended without the birth of the baby, or the divorce, though. Most of all, the author missed-out on Michael's reaction to Bree seeing his father, Declan. Maybe this was to leave room for a sequel? Marvelous twist to the common affair and kudos for Finn's grand gesture. I also loved the Irish nuances in vocabulary.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	0	Kate is 17 and has a younger sister, Tyler. They lost their mother three years ago and their father spends all his time at his girlfriend, Hannah's house. It is no wonder he didn't notice Kate is 9 months pregnant by the 36 year old (married) neighbor Sanjay. Tyler has to deliver the baby and Sajay hears it and confesses to his wife, Meera, who turns them in (as she is a doctor). Sanjay is arrested and David (the dad) is forced to answer tough questions. The baby goes into foster care and Kate and Tyler go to a group home. Slowly, they all work to piece their lives back together from (mother) Deidre's death to (baby) Deidre's birth.This was a REALLY odd story. The author focused on psychology and cultural aspects of the plot rather than action. Oddly, you really can't dislike any of the characters because you know so much about their personal pain. The father loves his girls, he just could not deal with his wife's death from cancer and knew he would never measure-up. Sanjay didn't sleep with Kate in a creepy way, and his wife, Meera is unbelievably rational, yet pitiable when faced with the truth. Even the girlfriend Hannah just wanted to be loved and didn't mean any harm.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Jessie Holland goes back to her home in AZ and her friend Erin Delahanty (married to the brother of the boy Jessie left at the altar) takes her place in NYC when Jessie sells an idea to a magazine about trading places to see if homemakers and career woman want what the other has. In the middle of all of this, Erin's marriage is falling apart and her teenage daughter is left reeling. Jessie has to choose between a new love interest in AZ and her boyfriend back in NYC whom she has been trying to get to propose. In the end, everyone has a new outlook on life and things have worked out for the best.The concept of "life swap" was interesting, but some of the twists were on the unbelievable side. Money never seems to be an issue, Mike (the ex-fiance) is over-the-top hostile, there are too many men throwing themselves at these two women, Jessie adjusts too easily to the bed and breakfast schedule (especially when we read pages of how Erin could barely keep up without her husband's help). Other than that, it is an easy read and NOTHING is left at the end without a complete wrap-up - tidy bow included. But -the title is totally misleading!
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Cannie Shapiro is 28 and works as a journalist. Her ex starts a job at a magazine and he writes a story about loving a fat girl - her. Cannie is not sure how to react, but then finds herself pregnant with his child, kicked out of a weight loss drug study with a doctor who likes her and suddenly the best friend of a movie star who sells Cannie's screenplay to Hollywood -throwing Cannie into the limelight. In the end, Cannie gets the doctor, accepts her fat self, has the baby (after serious complications) and finally gets over Bruce, taking his job in the process.The whole pregnancy story was nuts - why did she have to have his baby to get over Bruce? And then she is thin? Come on. Why does her mother have to be a lesbian and the new girlfriend a cause of the premature birth? Couldn't Cannie have had less drama - especially the hysterectomy - and end up in the same place? Did she have to sell a screenplay,get a movie star who redoes her house and end up with a doctor? This was just too over-the-top.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Nomi is a senior in high school in Canada - in East Village , a Mennonite town. She and her father are living alone now, her mother and sister, Tash, having left a while back. Her uncle is the minister and her boyfriend, Travis seems totally disconnected. Eventually, Nomi is excommunicated and her father also leaves, giving Nomi the chance to escape - to try and piece together a life out of the odd pieces she has had up to now. We leave Nomi not knowing what she does or what happened to her family.Reading the book flaps, I thought I would be reading a funny story about a Mennonite teen who yearns for modern comforts. Instead, I had a 246 page philosophy ramble. You are never told what happened to Trudie and Tasg or whether Ray is nuts, having a breakdown, going bankrupt or just quirky. What is up with Travis - is he married or a teen too? Why doesn't Nomi go to school? And why was she excommunicated instead of shunned? A totally confusing journey to nowhere.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	Kathy is a young girl growing up with her friends Ruth and Tommy in the English countryside at Halisham. Eventually, we find out that these children are clones, created for organ harvest at some point later in their lives. The children will serve as "carers" until they are "donors" and will live until they "complete". Through Kathy's perspective, we learn of the horrifying path they will take and feel for all of them - especially when Kathy and Tommy finally get together only to realize they can never have a true life together and that society only views them as genetic material.From the minute I started reading, I was completely fascinated by the story and eager to know the full picture. I never figured-out the next surprise and was amazed at the brilliance of the concept behind this novel. All the turns were believable, the characters well-developed (even without last names or physical descriptions) and the concept, thought-provoking. I credit the author with not allowing a "happy" ending and for leaving us hanging as to whether Kathy was ever a donor.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	Su-Jen leaves Maoist China in the 1950's and comes to Canada with her mother to be with her father - owner of the Dragon Cafe. She assimilates, but her mother is miserable in the small, quiet town. When the father's son from a previous marriage, Lee Keung, comes, the trouble begins as he starts an affair with his step-mother. He is forced to marry a mail-order bride, but the step-mom is already pregnant from him and Su-Jen has seen this ll happen, causing her to hate them both. In the end, she learns to forgive as she sees her father hold the baby boy - a reincarnation of the two sons lost by her parents before they married.The joy to read a book that is not about a rich or pregnant narrator! Although the Chinese word interjections were distracting at first, "lo fon" (honky) caught on and I appreciated the new phrases halfway through. I enjoyed the story and was hoping the mother would face harsher consequences for her infidelity, but in the end, the outcome made sense and does justice to the integrity of the characters as a whole. I really wish there was a sequel.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	1	1	Tallulah Nichols is turning 50. Instead of winding-down, her life is full of drama. She is divorcing her husband, then her magazine is infiltrated by a youth-obsessed boss who wants Tallulah to be the plastic surgery guinea pig. She becomes pregnant from a last fling with her ex and decides to keep the baby. She then has to deal with her son who is a career student, her soon to be wed daughter Dallas, her old neighbor Cy who proposes to her, a gynecologist who is mad for her and her job - where Tai (the boss) decides to exploit the pregnancy for increased circulation! Lu makes it through all and even marries the Dcotor in the end - with her new daughter safe and healthy in her arms.I didn't think I would be able to relate to a character this much older than I am, (and pregnant to boot), but the story was well-handled and developed. The slow progression between Lu and the doctor was believable, as were the reactions of family, friends and her boss. My only criticisms would be having too many characters and the stereotypical Spanglish of her friend Andrea - who lent nothing to the story.
A1DUH70A1GOEKJ	0	1	Arlette Rosen earns a living assisting others in fulfilling their dreams of writing a book. She is good at her job and her mailbox is always full of potential client pleas. Arlette has been seeing Jake for some time, but something just seems off. Enter Harbinger Singh, a tax lawyer who wants to win his ex-wife back by writing a novel loosely structured around her. Areltte is inspired by his quirky ways and begins to change herself. Yes, she ends up sleeping with him, but there is only one occurrence and it spells her rebirth. She turns away from Jake and cook doctoring and becomes a writer herself.I like the concept, but not the delivery. I never really cared about Jake and never understood his relationship with Arlette. I also didn't care when it ended. Harbinger was just weird and his personality totally unbelievable for a tax lawyer. I was happy Arlette could evolve and set her old ways free, but question why Jake was stagnant and no resolution came to Harbinger. The best quality was ending the book back where it started, giving the reader a sense of continuity in an otherwise chaotic tale.
A1DUI64ECLUJPG	0	0	So we bought this movie because we really like those two actors from Flight of the Conchords and Hitchhiker's Guide. And it's the scenes with Chevalier and Bronco/Brutus that are the only good bits of the movie. The rest is completely forgettable.
A1DUI64ECLUJPG	0	1	I was excited to see this but you can't judge a movie by the cover. I was captured by Robin Williams and all the great headliners on the cover. But after watching the entire movie I found that none of the words applied. (for me)
A1DUI64ECLUJPG	0	1	I loved the cat and the cat's narration in this movie but that was pretty much all.A hipster couple's issues didn't really make a captivating movie for me. Wish there was more focus on the time and space aspect than there was.
A1DUJ108XOXDKK	1	1	I have no complaint with this program. It does what it was intended for. I download lots of songs off...(not sure if allowed to say the site). The real guitar sounding feature tends to crash quite a lot, but it's no big deal for me. I just like the fact that I can download the music sheet for free and it allows me to slow down the tempo. I have not other complaints. Overall it's a great product.
A1DUJ108XOXDKK	1	1	I just got it say that it works if you take the time to practice. I started practicing, but I quit. cause once you activate that energy, your body starts to go through changes. Anyway, I'm thinking about picking it up again.
A1DUJ108XOXDKK	0	1	I can't really recommend this item. My kid who is 9 was not happy with it because the helmat was too heavy. We went to another store and got him a very light helmat for $15 dollars
A1DUJ108XOXDKK	1	1	First of all, I have a Mac 10.4.11 and the drivers won't work with it. The pen won't light, which means that the Mac is not recognizing it. I had downloaded the latest drivers and according to its instructions is supposed to work with 10.4, but that's not true. I thought there was something wrong with it until I boot up the windows XP version and it worked right after I installed the drivers. If you keep the Pen straight and not at an angle, you can get pretty close to the speed of highlighting. I had to type 35 chapters last semester to make my own notes. I had to take time off from work and it took me about two weeks. I do type 40 WPM, but it's just too much work and it's very exhausting turning your head in one direction while typing. Now with this gadget, summarizing chapter is a breeze. It's very fast, faster than I thought it would be. Everytime you lift the pen it automatically transfer the information and it's ready to continue. Love it, I just hope it would work with the Mac. I heard that it works fine with Mac os 10.5 version. I just hate looking at windows, but it's worth the trouble.

A1DURQALDKH2DE	1	1	If you are making beer, this is what you need. I know there are other sanitizers out there, but this one seems work. Some sanitizers are only for glass, but this seems to work on everything. The only downside, and it is minimal, is that it will slightly stain your white buckets. However, this staining does not affect anything other than the color of your bucket, and I have heard you can remove this by soaking your buckets overnight with some bleach and water. At first it's hard to believe that you don't need to rinse, but you really don't have to. It seems to dry quickly as well.
A1DURQALDKH2DE	1	1	Fit just fine, but the only thing it was missing was the plastic tether that attached the cap to the filler neck. Small problem, but I can see myself forgetting the cap sometime in the future. As far as I can tell you cannot remove the plastic tether from the OEM cap. Also, this was for my 2001 Ford Ranger.

A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	0	When I first saw this book, I thought to myself, "Uh oh. Hacks trying to make a quick buck by re-writing a chapter from his classic "About Face"!". Perhaps he was was doing just that, but he created a gem anyhow!For those that dont know, David Hackworth made a name for himself in the Vietnam War by figuring out a cost effective way of fighting the enemy that could have lead to US victory. Unfortunately, nobody would listen to him. This book focuses on Hack's third tour in Vietnam when he commanded a down and out infantry battalion in the Mekong Delta. After instilling some discipline in this pack of sullen draftees, he turned them into a winning combat team. He also rewrote their tactics. Instead of headlong and pointless search and destroy missions, Hack sat back and watched the battlefield and waited for the Communist enemy to trip up. When that happened, he poured every resource available into them and utterly crushed some of the best Viet Cong units in existence. When he turned over command, his unit racked up a 100 to 1 or so kill ratio. A ratio the enemy could not take.In this book, Hackworth shows how he did this. He also reveals significant obstacles he had to overcome. Besides inheriting a low quality unit, he had to deal with idiot superiors (in particular the Division commander GEN Ewell and Deputy Commander COL Ira Hunt). Reading how he got over these problems is a real treat.I believe this book is best suited for the historian wanting to better understand the Vietnam War. It is less useful for the aspiring junior military leader. I say this because much of what COL Hackworth did to succeed went directly against the wishes of his superiors and occasionally against military regulations. Hack could get away with this as he was rising star in the Army. The average leader trying to do much of what he did would wind up getting cashiered.I shaved off one star for filler. There are two chapters in this book dealing with the battalion medics and his soldiers' sexual proclivities. While both chapters are very interesting, they dont fit into the big picture all that well. Other than this, the book is a keeper.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	At the very beginning of this book, Tiziano Terzani sets the record straight. He unashamedly favors the Vietnamese Communists. By doing this, he rates an extra star for not putting me through the need to show his bias.Mr. Terzani was an Italian journalist at the time the Vietnam War came to its sad end. The primary focus is the North Vietnamese attack (or as he calls it "liberation") on the capital city of Saigon where he was situated. Terzani seems to be an honest man and I have little doubt the events noted in this story were those that he saw. But the reader must remember he saw just a tiny piece of the 1975 invasion.It would be nice if what he portrayed here was accurate. Unfortunately, we now know much about the North Vietnamese Anschluss. Terzani says there was no bloodbath because he didnt see any evidence of such. Well of course he didnt! Didnt he think it likely his handlers would keep him away from such activities? Of course it now common knowledge that the Viet Communists summarily executed multitudes of people after their victory and sent thousands more into gulags. Terzani also argues the South Vietnamese wanted to be "liberated" because he saw hardly any combat taking place in Saigon. Of course its common knowledge that RVN forces conducted their fight outside the city and there was little left to fight with once the tanks rolled into Saigon proper.This book is utterly and completely refuted today. Still, it is an interesting look at an interesting time. I found this book in a community college library and suspected it would be out of print. My Amazon search hints that its probably been reprinted fairly recently under different names. I wonder if Mr. Terzani added anything new to these reprints in light of what we know now..........
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I wont delve too much into the book much as so many reviewers have dealt with that quite well. Also, Im not going to discuss MacDonald's guilt or innocence much. Lets just say I find the book well written and believe MacDonald is guilty.Now that thats done, let me give you an interesting angle to the novel. I first picked up the book when I was in the Army. I enjoyed the beginning up to MacDonald leaving the Army and the final chapters after he was found guilty. The middle portion was not quite to my liking then.Fast forward a few years later and Im in law school taking the required evidence course. This class can be a bit dry and complicated. While delving into the minutia of how courts pick what evidence can be considered, I pick up Fatal Vision again. Wonder of wonders, that middle part I didnt like is chock full of evidence issues! Now while Im sure some will argue the Judge in this case incorrectly used the evidence rules, the analysis used in such matters is there and its applied to a truly interesting subject. Thanks Joe, you helped me ace Evidence! For that Im truly in your debt.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	What if the Atomic Bombs were not ready in 1945? The simple answer is Operation Downfall. This novel is about this epic battle that never was.I wont belabor what has already been said. The writing is excellent. The weaving of grand strategy and the fate of individual Americans and Japanese is flawless. The analysis is solid. Enough said.Two things I really like about this book that people havent really touched on are the use of characters in an alternate history novel and the authors' angle on the invasion v. A-Bomb debate.The characters in most AH stories I have read have the dimensions of my grade school stick figure drawings. Theyre basically just there to make the move that would change history the way the author desires. Westheimer's characters are very deep and thought provoking. You become intrigued by them and want to know more and more.There are a few books on the market that discuss potential invasions of Japan. Those that are not hyper technical treatises tend to be critiques of Truman's decision to nuke Japan. The normal theme is that US conspired to overplay the costs of invading Japan as an excuse to use atomic weapons. Mr. Westheimer does make a compelling case for the invasion to be relatively low cost (once the main defenses are breached there's little left but militia units made up of old men and schoolgirls armed with knives and pitchforks). However, he stays away from the conspiracy issue. This enhances the book by keeping the focus on the invasion (and people caught up in it).I strongly urge Alternate History fans to read this novel. It is by far the best AH book Ive come across.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Heres an interesting book that has been somewhat discredited over time. Still, the analysis is excellent and worth considering.The basic theme is that Japan and the United States could become opponents again with the end of the Cold War. The titanic battle against communism required Japan and the United States to come to an understanding. Basically, Japan was to manufacture goods, allow the US basing privileges and provide some defensive capability by patrolling the airspace and ocean immediately surrounding Japan. In return, the Unites States would guarantee Japan access to natural resources and provide for Japan's military defense. With the Cold War over, this arrangement has become economically unsound for the US to continue. A new political arrangement must be developed.The authors show how Japan must have access to material resources from Asia and the Middle East to continue as a strong nation. They also reveal that Japan could probably aquire this access on its own through new alliances (especially with India) and by rebuilding its military. This would put Japan in conflict with the US since America needs control of the Western Pacific to feel stable.The analysis leading up to the conclusion is inspiring. Friedman and Lebard boil down Japanese and US strategic interests and show how these needs are (or could be) met. They also show us how Japan could quickly rebuild its military forces.As a prior post reveals, the conclusion is less than stellar in some aspects. They think Japan should ally itself with North Korea. Fat chance of that even before the Kim Dynasty started lobbing nuke capable missiles in Japan's direction! Another point that seems strange is the idea they put forward of placing a US armored division in South Korea. Why? The terrain just isnt right for large tank units.The conflict the authors envision has not occurred for many reasons. As I noted above, they didnt factor in North Korea very well. Also, they didnt forsee Tokyo's economic bust. Even so, you can see some of the elements they discussed in motion today. A good example is the growing pressure in Japan to remove the Marines from Okinawa. This wouldnt have happened during the Cold War.The authors missed some critical points in their analysis. Still, they did seem to capture many of the post-Cold War pressures we see today in Northeast Asia.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	If you came to this book looking for Mad Max, dont bother. If you want to reinforce your concept that life on Earth will end with the explosion of one nuke, go elsewhere. But if youre interested in how the collapse of society would impact everyday people, this novel is for you.Pat Frank takes a fairly reasoned look at the affects of a nuclear war on small town America in the early to mid 1960s. To put it in a nutshell, everone in a small Florida town goes stir crazy for a few days after the bombs drop, looks around and sees they may survive if they act normal and build a new society and economy. How they get from point A to point B is the real joy of this book.The one legitimate flaw with this tome that others have pointed out is it is quite dated, especially when considering race relations. Also, gender issues are dealt with from an angle we would not be used to today. Most (but not all) of the black characters are somewhat ignorant of the larger world. The female characters are emotional and are prepared to collapse into crying fits over the smallest of quandaries. That said, Pat Frank does present these characters sympathetically and allows them to shine. In ways, this quirk enhances the book as the author's take on these matters is largely appropriate to the time frame.The next major point of criticism is that the book doesnt accurately reflect the truth about nuclear war as there are survivors. When considering this issue, one must remember the time frame of the story. The Soviets didnt have that many nukes in this time period and had very little capability of dropping them on America. If anything, Frank goes beyond what would be likely.Finally Ive noted lots of the poor ratings given to this book came from people who were forced to read it in grade school. This is certainly understandable. I would be inclined to give low ratings to books stuffed down my throat too! Still, I urge prospective buyers to take these critiques with a grain of salt.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I really loved this book. Bradley Martin is a reporter who has extensively travelled in North Korea and has met many of the Kim regimes ruling caste members. He paints an intriguing portrait of North Korea.There are many chapters, but they basically break into three categories. These deal with the rise of the Kim regime, life in North Korea, and the future of North Korea. There is certainly overlap, but these are the primary categories.The most difficult chapters are certainly those dealing with the rise to power of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. I say this because, as Martin freely admits, there are very complicated mythologies surrounding these characters. Mr. Martin goes on the assumption that there is a nugget of truth in all myths and tries very hard to find them. As an example, there is a myth that Kim Il Sung was the most important anti-Japanese guerilla leader who nearly single handedly ejected Japanese forces from Korea. After detailed and exhaustive research, the author shows that Kim was a moderately important guerilla leader who threw his lot in with the Soviet Red Army after being defeated by Japanese forces. In this way, Mr. Martin develops what could be the most accurate picture we have of the Kims' early days. If he is found to ever be wrong, it wont be for not trying hard.The next set of chapters revolve around everyday life in the DPRK. He gets his information partially through his trips there, but more importantly through defector testimony. Needless to say, life in the Workers'Paradise sucks. There is little food (unless you are a high level party member) and there is a constant risk you will offend someone and wind up in a prison camp. Not much we dont already know, but Martin reveals much that is new. For example, the citizenry is completely loyal despite mismanagement and abuse. Even defectors cant bring themselves to criticize the Kims! And there is much much more.Finally, Martin looks to the future. He shows us North Korea's first faltering steps to become connected with the world economy. He also delves into who may replace Kim Jong Il in the future. I wasnt too convinced with his argument that the West should negotiate on WMD issues, but he makes the argument pretty well.One final note. The best part of this book is Martin's credibility. He seems to have no axes to grind. He has no problem revealing the bad aspects of the DPRK or the good. Mr. Martin comes across as a straight shooter. This could be what is most important in making this such a wonderful book.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Here is an excellent alternate history that delves into a world where European civilization is destroyed by the Plague. It spans the time period from the Middle Ages to modern times.This world is all in all pretty plausible. The Islamic world essentially fills the vaccuum left by the destruction of Europe and competes with China, India, and to a lesser extent those we call American Indians. To tie events together over such a long time, Robinson uses an interesting tool. He assumes reincarnation exists and has a group of souls come back to Earth over time as various key players. While this mechanism is not perfect, it is more often than not useful in binding together what a somewhat unrelated short stories.That all said, I agree with Michael Clawson's critique. My understanding is that the loss of population from the Plague was a key spark in causing the social and technological advances in Europe. Mr. Robinson has this alternate world advance at nearly the same pace technologically and only moderately slower socially. Doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me. Where is the incentive for China to make more efficient tools when theres a huge surplus of people? And why would India become a relatively free society when the status quo hasnt been changed much? I think there could be decent explanations for this. Unfortunately, Robinson doesnt really delve into them much.One of the nice things about alternate history is that you can see the importance of a given factor if it is removed. This book doesnt take advantage of that very well. This alternate world seems to follow our timeline too closely. There are major technological advances in the Middle Ages in Afghanistan simmilar to those in our Europe of the same time. The Chinese and Arabs colonize the Americas at about the same time period as Europe did in our world. There is an epic Moslem/China war set at about the time of our World War I. It even has trench warfare! So Mr. Robinson seems to be telling us (I believe unintentionally) that Europe doesnt really matter! Im not buying that. Not at all.One final (and minor) critique. The author hints at there having been a residual European culture. I think it would have been helpful if Robinson threw his reincarnating characters into Plague ridden Europe. Perhaps they could have been in a nomadic grouping in France searching for safety or a small village in Northern Scotland that managed to survive. As best as I can tell the only Europeans Robinson identifies are what appears to be a caveman in Hungary in the very beginning and references to a "nature preserve" on an English island in the 20th Century. Showing what happened in Europe could have added depth to this story. Not a big problem though. I just would have like to have seen it.This is pretty good alternate history. Not good enough that I would likely reread the book. But I'll certainly come back and skim certain portions!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Here is the grandaddy of military scifi. On a lark, Johnny Rico enters military service upon graduating from high school. After going through a brutal and exacting basic training course, he becomes a Mobile Infantryman and is thrown into the fray of an interstellar war. The enemy is an intelligent and tenacious arachnid species known as "The Bugs".When you think about it, this book could easily have been a flop. A large portion of the novel takes place in classrooms and in the inner thoughts of Rico. Despite this, Heinlein manages to keep a quick pace. He also gives us much to mull over. Some issues he presents include who should be in charge of society, should the army's role be given to Naval forces,are military drafts good, and how should we choose military officers. There is much food for thought here.In my opinion though, there are some faults that nearly make me want to take away a star. The author doesnt really explain why his "veteranocracy" (only military veterans can vote or hold office) is the perfect form of governance for mankind. After exploring the issue in some depth, Heinlein finally just posits its best because it works. Thats a pretty big leap considering the concept has never really been tried yet! I also have issues with the author's future military structure. Rico's army has almost no logisticians or people allocated to staff work. All officers are combat leaders who take on support/staff work as a secondary role. So a Divisional supply officer will actually command a combat force. I cant see how this could work. Imagine this supply officer trying to sort out a munition distribution problem when he is knee deep in a combat action and with almost no ordnance techs to assist! This future army is certainly highly automated (they move about in powerful and computerized armored suits) and this may allow for such a structure. Still, I am skeptical. Finally, there is officer selection. One cant be a Mobile Infantry officer without first experiencing combat. While this is a laudable hurdle, I think its impractical. The author hints that there had been no major combat actions for some time before Johnny is sent out to fight the Bugs. Seems to me, this army runs the risk of running out of qualified officer candidates! Imagine if the old USSR had this as a requirement to be an officer. Where would they find combat vets in say 1972 when the last time the Red Army was in the field was 1945?I reviewed the movie a few months ago and sort of panned it for making this future society into something Mussolini (or maybe Hitler even) could have been proud of. Some of the other reviewers reinforce this too. Its really not there. The general populace in the novel seem to have the basic civil liberties we do (except voting rights). On a less touchy point, the book develops an interesting (if minor) sub issue regarding the tensions between Rico and his father. In the movie, Verhoeven kills off Rico Sr in the beginning. Heinlein lets him live and meet up with his son towards the end of the book. I fully understand movie directors have time constraints that force them to shave out such things. Still, I would liked to have seen this sub-plot survive.This is an excellent story. There are some minor blemishes but in the end its a novel that has stood the test of time.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Ever read a law review article? Pretty dry and boring stuff. But here, James Huston takes what could be a stuffy topic and wraps it around an action/political thriller story. The result is wonderful.An American freighter is hijacked by terrorists who proceed to execute the crew members and take the captain hostage. President Manchester(a suspected pacifist) chooses to do nothing about it. As one could imagine, many are aghast at this, including the President's political nemesis, Speaker of the House Stanbridge. It appears there is little hope until Jim Dillon, a lawyer on Stanbridge's staff, discovers a dormant power in the US Constitution known as The Letter of Marque and Reprisal that gives Congress the power to direct military (or at least Naval) forces into action.Things get complicated after this. After Congress passes the Letter, the President initiates legal action. Also, its uncertain whether the Admiral commanding the Task Force will honor the Letter. For those and more questions, I direct you to read the book!The legal analysis is overall very good. Some critics note the Letter of Marque and Rerisal provision is just another enhancement to the President's war making capability. This is not correct. There is nothing in the Constitution directly tying the Executive to this power. Traditionally, Presidents did sign these Letters but Huston shows that tradition does not trump the Consitution. He deals crippling blows to other arguments against the Letter too.The action is also excellent. We get to see the full power of a carrier task force unfold before our eyes. Everything from Special Ops and Marine assaults to air attacks. Huston's naval background only enhances this aspect of the novel.An excellent work. For the thinking person who enjoys red hot action, you could do worse!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	0	The End of the Cold War put a real hurt on the Military Techno-Thriller business. Coyle's "The Ten Thousand" is a good case in point.To have a fight, you have to have an antagonist. Before 1989, that was easy......the Commies! After the Berlin Wall came down, that became problematic. Authors handled this with a wide array of options. In my opinion the best were those that searched for another bad guy like drug trafficers or Terrorists. I found the worst to be those that esentially went into denial. You know, the ones that have the Communists take back power and threaten the world again. Then there are those who dredge up Nazis like Coyle did. Yawn. How unoriginal.I have two other problems with this novel. First is Nancy Kozak. Sorry Harold, but you gave her too much of a free ride as one of the first female infantry officers. In my eyes, her presense in this story makes as much sense as Pee Wee Herman being the NATO commander. Then there is the light infantry thing. Coyle's military experience primarily comes from serving in mechanized units and he can be unbelievably hostile to light infantry/airborne forces. Strangely, light units often play key roles in Coyle's novels. This one is no exception. Despite this, he often blasts these units (especially paratroopers) as being an anachronism.If you just like military novels you may enjoy this one. The combat scenes are decent and pretty accurate. But if you cant stomach poorly considered backdrops stay away from this one.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I initially did not want to purchase this book for two reasons. First, there were numerous books on the last days of the Republic of Vietnam and I thought the author would just plow through the same old stuff. Also, the title implied it would just be about the Embassy Marines in Saigon. I was pleasantly surprised!Charles Henderson's primary focus is on the Marines at the embassy in Saigon and the consulate in Da Nang. To a lesser extent he looks into final activities in Can Tho and Nha Trang. However, he gives us more to consider.The author reveals that both the Communist and Republican Vietnamese were essentially on their last legs. America was drastically reducing aid to South Vietnam. But North Vietnam was apparently facing similar problems too! In a last ditch gambit, North Vietnam begins to attack South Vietnam in late 1974. If the campaign goes well, they will likely prevail. If it goes poorly, they will probably never have another chance.Unlike previous stories of this tragic time, Henderson reveals Communist victory was not a foregone conclusion.....at least not initially. ARVN had ample supplies in its two northernmost corps to weather a large scale attack. Unfortunately, South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu makes the disasterous decision to have I and II Corps fall back and defend key population centers even though these forces were already heavily engaged and would be unable to take most of their supplies with them. This tactial withdrawl resulted in a route that guaranteed the destruction of South Vietnam's military and Communist victory.Another plus about this book is that its more than just about the last US Marines in South Vietnam. Besides the US Marines, we see RVN and NVA generals, Viet Marines, ARVN officers, etc. Henderson even has room for South Vietnamese artists and an actress to come on the scene! Very comprehensive.I was close to giving this novel 5 stars but changed my mind. One of the best sub plots is the epic journey of a South Vietnamese Marine battalion commander who leads his men on a month long journey through enemy lines. Once he gets his unit back into whats left of South Vietnam, he disappears! I would really liked to have seen what finally happened to these guys. Other than that, this is a great book.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	0	I tend to agree with Dennis Duncan on this book. It starts off great but then crashes and burns horribly by the end.Here's the basic story. A solar flare destroys everything in the Eastern hemisphere. The rest of civilization goes under when Soviet military leaders assume the flare is a nuke attack and unleash their ICBMs. A small community survives at a moon base but faces serious survival problems. The biggest one being that lack of fissionable material forces them to preiodically go back to Earth and forage for reactor rods. On one foray Daniel Morgan, the unofficial moonbase leader, refuses to come back and hoards up the available fissionables in an attempt to force the moon people to make a permanent connection with Earth. After 20 or so years, his wife (the official leader) sends her son Alec back with a quasi-military unit to get the rods.....and to get back at dear old dad for walking out on everyone.Like I already said, the novel starts out great. Bova walks us through the destruction of Earth very well and shows us how the moon base people cope. The Reath/Moon tension is pretty interesting too. This is all very well thought out and plausible. But once Alec Morgan sets foot on Earth, the story collapses into a bad post apocalypse type thriller.To make things worse, the author does some bizarre things that really harm the book. There are three items that particularly annoyed me.First off is wasting time on one refugee. Ben Bova put significant resources into developing a New England college professor who survives and cons his way to the moon by convincing moon raiders looking for fuel rods he has the secret to predicting the next solar flare. Okay, pretty neat. But what does he do with this guy? Nothing! The last we see this guy hes talking with Alec Morgan about fairly irrelevant stuff! Why did you bother, Ben??Then there is Morgan's wife. Bova presents her as a manipulative and scheming shrew until about 2/3 of the way throught the story where she just disappears. He tees up a great villaness and then seems to just forget about her. Not good.Finally there is Alec Morgan. He is the closest we get to a character we can sympathize with. But then the author ruins him. How? Well, first off he rapes a medical technician that makes him angry. Oh yeah, that was really necessary to the plot. Then he has an incestuous relationship with a girl who is essentially his adopted sister. I have no idea what the author thought he was doing with this little romance.That all said I feel compelled to give the book two stars. First, the beginning chapters are really good. Also, its pretty simple to read. My basic opinion is that there are certainly worse novels of this sort. Unfortunately, there are numerous ones that are much MUCH better!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I first read this book in 1983. Although it has some quirky faults, I enjoyed it greatly and I have re-read it on many occasions.In the early 1980s, the United States collapses economically from lack of oil. As part of its recovery plans, America is sending people out of the country to cut down its population. This is where Jonah Scott and the crew of Air Britain's Speedbird 626 come in. Shortly after leaving New York in late 1985 with a load of mostly refugees on board, Scott and company receive a message that all out nuclear war has commenced. After all regular landing options are extinguished in nuclear fireballs, Scott manages to land at a NATO airbase in the Azores that has only been partially destroyed in a netron bomb attack. Jonah and company soon discover their refuge is only temporary. A planet wide cloud of atomic particles is slowly floating down on them. Their only option is to fly Speedbird 262 to Antarctica where the air is clear!There are two versions of this story. I have been lucky enough to read both. The first Sunless Sea novel I bought has a happy ending. I recently came across an older printing that has a sad ending. Strangely enough there is little difference between the versions. The major difference seems to be an extra two pages at the end of the older book. Im curious as to what brought about the change. Havent been able to find out anything.Having read the older version also helps explain some of what appeared to be improbable events discussed in the first chapters such as the oil crisis that brings down the USA. It seems like reasonable speculation given that the book was originally written in the late 70s rather than the early 80s.This is easily one of the best end of the world novels. I urge you to get a copy!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	When I read the cover of this book, it sounded great. A suicide mission to Titan to follow up on the Huygens probe discovery of life on that far away moon. The first chapter describing the probe's descent and landing was spectacular. After that, the story quickly and painfully collapsed.I did not get far with this tome. However, I figured out three things. First, Baxter seems to be quite knowledgeable in the aerospace engineering field and doesnt have the faintest idea how American politics or governmental function. Finally, the author doesnt know how to create characters.Mr. Baxter's engineering background could have made this a great book. Unfortunately, he seems to assume his readers are aerospace engineers! I found quite a few instances where Baxter refers to items using acronyms and never explains what the acronyms are. After a few examples of this, I phased out.The author takes a stab at the American governmental and political system.....and falls flat on his face. I didnt get that far in the novel so I didnt view the whoppers of mistakes other reviewers cite. But let me tell you this much. Even the stauchest of NASA critics dont propose downsizing the outfit and putting it under control of Department of Agriculture!! Geez, where did that come from??Finally, character development sucks. Again, I didnt get too far. But I read long enough to get a decent picture of two female astronauts (one Chinese and one American) who were thoroughly obnoxious. There was also the NASA Chief who seemed to have the personality of a glass of lukewarm water. The only character I found somewhat compelling was Astronaut Lamb, who seemed to mostly lurk in the backgound and look cool. I truly wish I could have read further to see them get killed off!It is truly sad. Baxter seems to be a uniquely gifted person who picked up what could have been a compelling story line. The guy just needs to learn skills outside of engineering like writing and political science to pull it off!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	I had heard great things about Michener's works. I also enjoyed watching some of his mini-series' on TV when I was younger (and less experienced). This was my first try at a Michener novel. It is probably my last too!The biggest problem I had with this book is that it takes the term historical fiction WAAAY too far. I can understand making up fake astronauts as using the guys actually scheduled for the Apollo 18 mission would have hemmed him in too much. I can even rationalize a fictional US Senator. There's enough of them that they get lost in the mix. But carving an entire state out of Oklahoma??? Every time I got to a mention of the state of Fremont, it was like going over a speed bump at 100 miles an hour.....without shock absorbers! Why was this necessary? WHY???Michener was a Naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. The Navy made him a historian because of his education , research skills and ability to take in large amounts of data and present comprehensive and accurate reports. From reading this this novel, it appears Michener must have thrown those skills to the curb by the time he wrote this lemon. The main protagonist fights for and wins an appointment to the Naval Academy because he sees this as the best way to get into aviation and space programs. Thats reasonable. But what do we see of the academy? We see this character happily and almost lazily operating a sailboat! Come on James, you must know that USNA isnt a stroll through the park!! Ever heard of plebe year?? And heres another thing. There is a Korean female reporter who is moderately important to the story. However, she has a Japanese last name. Sure, there were Koreans who took Japanese names before WW2 ended. But no self respecting Korean would keep such a name in the late 60s and early 70s!! This is a somewhat minor detail that I know of only through personal experience. But it makes me wonder what else he got wrong.I gave this book two stars because the underlying story is really interesting. Michener also writes well. If it wasnt for the fact that he kept slamming me in the face with unnecessary modifications to history and some pretty big factual oversights, I could have enjoyed this book.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I bought this gem as in hardback form years ago. Ive read through it so many times its about to fall apart! I see it as a must for anyone pursuing or contemplating a military career. I say this because it shows what to do and what not to do to succeed. The main elements being competence and patronage.Marcinko has the first element down to a science. Richard Marcinko is arguably the best special operations officer the American military ever produced. If not the best, he certainly makes the short list. In his multi-decade career, Marcinko re-wrote the book on Naval Special Warfare many times. As a junior officer, he was in the vanguard of conducting more aggressive (and successful) operations in Vitenam than most of his peers were inclined to do. After the war was over, he took command of an entire SEAL team and moved it into operating on a larger scale. He did this because he correctly saw that such units would be deployed in larger formations in the future. Then there is the crown jewel of the Marcinko career....SEAL Team 6. Marcinko developed this premier counter-terror/high value mission force from the ground up. Today, Americans can sleep better at night because of Marcinko's skill and leadership in getting this unit off the drawing board.Unfortunately for Marcinko, he fails in patronage. To get further in the American military, one must have friends in high places to sing your praises and protect you. You must also avoid alienating others, especially your peers and superiors. The author was actually good at nurturing relationships with superiors willing to aid him. Unfortunately, he showed a complete disregard when it came to not making enemies. He rationalizes this away in many ways. The main ones being he was protecting his men or the mission required it. But it doesnt change the end result. Eventually, his protectors retired and he was faced with a phalanx of foes who managed to get him a nice vacation to a Federal prison.Marcinko has a good down to earth writing style and is fairly open about his errors. The only thing I think he could have done better would have been to go into more detail regarding the criminal case against him. I believe it had something to do with a misappropriation of funds that is not uncommon in the military. Marcinko is fairly vague about details so we dont know the full story. I suspect he is quiet on this to avoid further criminal prosecution. It would have been nice if he waited for statutes of limitations to have run so he could have spoken freely.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	0	The Cliff Notes version of the critics and reviewers who liked this book would be "Yeah, its some propaganda but its more than that". To this I say it is almost nothing but propaganda.Look at the pictures. All except the most mundane photos are clearly staged. The subjects are all in properly heroic stances, the enemy bodies are all perfectly mangled and in nice rows and the ambushes are textbook perfect. Heck, the smoke even billows just right! A good example is the swamp surgery photograph everyone seems to fawn over. The water is calm, the supposedly wounded soldier is calmly awaiting the doctors and the surgical team show not even an iota of tension. If you believe this is a real time pic, I have some beachfront property in Kansas Id like to sell you!And heres another thing. There are only three pictures involving the American military. Ive seen pictures from Communist Bloc sources of Communist Vietnamese troops prancing around dead Americans. Why are these not in the book? My guess is the editors couldnt get their sources to part with such pics. Its not something the Communist Viets would want to reveal at a time when theyre fresh out of friends and desperately needing US economic assistance!Do I think this book is worthless? No. It does give us at least a partial image of how the other side saw things. And the pictures do have a stark grandeur to them. The problem is the editors try to make this tome to be something that its not. Its a collection of propaganda photos. Nothing more. Nothing less.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	0	I found this book in my local library while searching for information on the activities of the modern United States Marine Corps. While it goes pretty far in meeting this interest, its got some really annoying baggage.The basic premise of Mr. Warren's story seems to be the United States Marine Corps is the only organization capable of defending the interests of the nation. The other services are failed organizations lacking in the martial skill, charisma and intelligence to do much more than thwart Marines in their activities and to occasionally produce a leader who will praise their greatness. To apparently reinforce this, the author almost always uses lower case terminology when referring to members of the supposedly inferior branches. I really don't see the point of all this. The Marines have an illustrious history which does not need the belittling of other services to help it along.If Mr. Warren could have proved his premise, I would not be so harsh. But the man just does not seem to have much of a clue when it comes to the background of the "lesser" services and their histories. This can best be seen in his take on activities in Somalia in the early 1990s. From the author's vantage, the Marines pretty much had Somalia stabilized when the Army took over and screwed up everything by not using Marine techniques. This is a massive oversimplification given that the Marine and Army missions in Somalia were so different comparisons just do not make sense. Perhaps if he delved into a little Army specific research he might have realized this. Sadly, it appears the author just relied on official Marine sources such as one would get from Public Affairs Officers. How does one otherwise explain the author's bizarre comment that Marines pioneered the use if helicopters in warfare (yeah, Marines were first to actually use them but most of the innovations came from the Army during the Vietnam War).The only part I liked was Warren's recounting of recent Marine combat activities. While a bit dry at times, he does managage to pull together the big picture and a foxhole view pretty well. But even then, youve got to put up with lots of propaganda.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	In my humble opinion, Mr. Ruggero squandered a great opportunity to justify the peculiar education given by the United States Military Academy. A Senate fact finding commission has arrived at West Point looking into whether the Republic really needs this institution. I was expecting the author to run USMA through a gauntlet of criticism on matters such as forcing cadets to take part in athletics, the institution's fixation with engineering in a time when the Army's need for officers with such educations has drastically diminished, the plebe system, etc. While the athletics issue is given significant attention, nothing else really is. The main conflict seems to come down to an a publicity hungry Senator and his amoral staffers digging up anything bad they can find and the West Point leadership (officers and cadets) thwarting them. The primary problem the book looks at is sexual pecadillos and the possible improper reaction of the USMA residents to this problem. I hardly think this is a big problem at the Point.That said, Ruggero does give us an interesting tale. The characters are all compelling in their own way and the pace of the story is good. In particular, I commend Mr. Ruggero for giving us an interesting look at a person who rarely ever shows up in such novels, the military spouse. Now we really only get a look at one (Kathleen Gates) and she is presented in a very unflattering way. Probably in an unrealistic way too. However, I must say I met watered down versions of Mrs. Gates when I was in the Army.This is a good and very reader friendly story. Just dont expect to get a good look at the inner workings of West Point. USMA is more of a backdrop to a story of political infighting. But its still a damn good story.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	0	I read this book shortly after it came out. At that time, I found it enlightening but was a bit too young to fully comprehend what the author was getting at. I recently purchased a new copy at a local used book store. While I still find it relevant, I have some concerns over Mr. Cockburn's conclusions and his methods.The basic theme is the Soviet military was an incompetant mess manned by poorly trained/motivated servicemen and equipped with some of the worst military equipment known to mankind. The conclusion is a tad elusive but could probably be boiled down to we should resist Western military bureaucrats' penchant for demanding more sophisticated and expensive equipment to keep up with the Soviets because its unnecessary and their stance is likely to bring about World War III.The basic problem I see with the book is the author's credentials are limited. He is a highly educated journalist who has extensive contacts within Western military agencies. However, it appears he never actually served in any of the NATO armed forces. This doesnt automatically disqualify him to comment as he has, but it makes his knowledge base somewhat limited. Also, he is very wonkish and gets caught up in statistical/numerical data at the expense of the big picture. So what we get is a book full of fairly raw (but still good and relevant) information which poorly process said data.How does this impact the tale? Well consider this. Mr Cockburn reveals to us NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Western Europe were at numerical parity. While accurate, he doesnt take into account the proportion of Warsaw Pact servicemen in direct combat roles as opposed to their NATO counterparts is significantly higher. By just looking at raw numbers, Mr. Cockburn makes the fatal error of valuing the importance of a US Navy clerk/typist stationed in Naples with three Soviet Motor Rifle privates on the East/West German border. And while his revelations regarding the horrible quality and fragility of most Soviet military equipment is spot on, he doesnt seem to comprehend its not all that important given Soviet doctrine was to view men and machines as expendable resources about on par with the Western viewpoint of ammunition.I am extremely reluctant to Monday Morning Quarterback Mr. Cockburn's work here. Given his vantage in the early 80s, his train of thought isnt completely off base. However, I feel it important to note his horribly faulty analysis of US weapons that had been deployed in this timeframe. The author is harshly critical of the M1 tank, F15 air superiority fighter and Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (to name a few) and cites them as examples of Western military bureaucrats' penchant for demanding bad equipment for personal gain. I find it bizarre in the extreme just about every US weapon system Mr. Cockburn criticizes has set the standard and have been found to be vastly superior to anything else on the markets. I suspect this could be chalked up to Cockburn's likely distrust for anyone part of "The System". If he were more even handed, perhaps he could have seen the great potential of these then newly employed tools. It also reveals a fatal imbalance in his analysis.This all said, the book is highly useful. I only give it two stars, but do this only because of the high rating double post a few years back. If it were not for this, I would have given it 3 stars. Mr. Cockburn gives us much good data in the form of raw numbers and statistics. Even more important is his extensive application of anecdotal information from Soviet emigres. The first hand stories of former Red Army vets adds a personal touch lacking in most books of this nature and goes a long way to making the tome highly readable. In the end, I find this book a keeper. Just understand Mr. Cockburn's depth of experience in the matters he discusses here is not as deep as it should be and he seems to have an axe to grind.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	To me this is two books in one. Its is a story of faith in the face of adversity. In that it is excellent. Since that has been discussed here heavily, I wont go any further with that concept. What I find more interesting is Cdr Waddle has unintentionally given us an expose' on the US Navy.I served in the Army so my knowledge in this realm is academic. However, it seems to me submarine officers are highly screened for quality and competency. From reading this story I come out wondering how Scott Waddle ever got in command of a submarine let alone be allowed to serve on one in any position!The first half of this autobiography is devoted to Waddle explaining his Naval career. It isnt pretty. He recounts one story after another of cutting corners, disobeying direct orders, outmaneuvering supervisors and ignoring inconvenient regulations. Not only that Waddle doesnt strike me as being one of the sharpest knives in the drawer. I find it hard to believe an officer can get to the two decade mark of Naval service and honestly think his career could in any way survive ramming a civilian watercraft. I did five years in the Army (of all places) and knew the answer to that one!To me this is the great value of this book. The Navy somehow let an incapable person who knew the art of smooth talking slip through the cracks long enough he wound up in command of an extremely powerful warship. This inattention resulted in tragedy. I see a number of sailors have come here and posted comments. Please tell me Waddle is a fluke!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Third World War: The Untold Story is a follow on to General Hackett's World War III, August 1985. Its presented as an expansion on the original by looking at some more secondary areas of conflict and by the hypothetical release of classified information. Instead of delving almost exclusively on the fighting in Europe as in the original book, Hackett explores what would transpire in other parts of the globe during his World War III such as Asia and Central America.From a readability standpoint, I find it light years better than his first book on this topic. In the original, he makes very heavy use of NATO acronyms. If you dont know what these mean, the story bogs down into a messy alphabet soup. While Hackett still makes heavy use of the acronyms, he gives them a bit more of a human flavor. So CINCNorth becomes a 52 year old Norwegian general instead of just CINCNorth. He also uses the adventures of a Soviet Infantry Lieutenant to follow the battle in Europe. Things like this make the story much easier to follow.I took away one star for two reasons. First off, the acronym thing is still a problem, just less so. If you dont know NATO lingo, youre gonna spend an awful lot of time looking up what the author means when he refers to SACEUR, AFCENT, AFNORTH, etc. The next problem I have is the chain of events in Europe collapses once NATO counterattacks. Before this point, Hackett goes into significant detail regarding Warsaw Pact forces taking such and such city or crossing certain international borders. Once the Communists are on the run, that all disappears. There are vague mentions of "retaking West German territory" and hints at NATO forces crossing into East Germany, but no detail.There is another issue with this and the previous book. It is very British-centric and mildly conceited. British land forces are presented as the absolute best and the lynch pin of success. The German Army gets kudos as does the Dutch Army. All other NATO armies are presented as mediocre. The US Navy and Air Force make a good showing, but do so primarily through actions and not the author stating they are of high quality. When presenting conflicts outside of Mainland Europe, the author's patience seems to be very much tied to how vital the area is to the defense of the UK. Fighting in Scandinavia is presented in a very positive manner. Same with operations in the Middle East. Hackett gets harshly critical about activities in South America and makes snide comments about activities in Korea. I suppose this is expected. The author is a long serving British Army officer so such a vantage point makes some sense. Also, his opinions on the various NATO military forces were fairly (though not completely) appropriate for the late 70s-early 80s time frame when this and his previous book were published. I didnt factor these criticisms into my overall rating given there is a modicum of reason to them. Just understand these issues exist.If you want a look at a hypothetical World War II fought between NATO and the USSR/Warsaw Pact, this is almost certainly the best book on the market.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	I really wish Amazon would let us give half stars. Personally, I think this is a three and a half star book. I choose four out of a combination of generosity and general disagreement with the more critical reviews.I have read a number of these Greenhill/Tsouras alternate history anthologies. While I have quibbles with some of the individual stories, overall the series has been quite brilliant. This installment does not rise to this level.To me the biggest problem is the individual authors here generally lack a broad vision found in the other installments. I do not know exactly why this is as the writers have good pedigrees. I think some of them even have excellent short stories in the other Greenhill alternate history works. But the stories tend to have a limited scope and end abruptly. A good example is James Arnold's "Pusan Disaster". I don't necessarily disagree with his analysis that had the North Koreans pushed harder and faster, they would have won. But it simply ends with Communist victory. There is no mention of how such an outcome impacts such issues as Japanese pacifism, the goings on in Vietnam, the general flow of the Cold War, etc. In the other installments in this series, authors of abruptly ending stories often used footnotes to flesh out the future flow of events. Not here. Some of the articles even end with history seeming to fall back into line as we know it. There is nothing necessarily wrong with a story like Mr. Hathaway's "First Blood" where Allied and Soviet air forces shoot it out during the Berlin Airlift but nothing really changes down the road. There is certainly some value to such an analysis. However, I think its bad form to do so in a small tome like this one. If Tsouras was limited to 250 or so pages, he should have reserved space for zingers.And then there is Tsouras' own article. I couldn't bring myself to read it, but scanned it enough to get a good understanding of it. It was very cute. But cute has no place in an anthology like this!Despite this, some of the articles are quite excellent and make this book a worthwhile buy for alternate history aficionados. Now, I shall take some space to respond to some of the prior criticisms with which I disagree:1. The Vietnam Scenarios: Many of the prior critiques show a strong dislike of the two Vietnam scenarios. Personally, I found Griffith's civil affairs focused story the best and most plausible of the lot. He gives us a good point of departure (McNamara listening to different advisors) and runs it to a reasonable conclusion (Republic of Vietnam becomes a palatable option and American resolve isnt drained dry on a secondary front of the Cold War). Kiley's revenge fantasy is much more problematic. The fatal flaw here is he doesn't explain what happened with the 50-60,000 Chinese Soldiers who garrisoned North Vietnam in the period of this invasion. Are they not present? Did Mao tell them not to fight the Americans? We don't really know. But I know one thing. There is no way the NVA could stand up to the US armed forces in a combined arms battle.2. No Nuclear General Exchange: I entirely support not having one of these stories in here. What is the point of having a story where something bad happens, the US President and Soviet Premier press buttons, a whole bunch of people are vaporized and mankind goes back to the Bronze Age (if not further)?3. No NATO/Soviet War in Central Europe: Having such a scenario would not have been completely wrong. However I hearken back to my limited space comment. If you're going to publish a book like this with less than 300 pages, do you want an article on a topic which has been written about in great depth by the likes of Clancy, General Sir John Hackett, etc.?All an all a good book. But it could have been much better.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	Back in early Fall of 2009, I saw this movie in the theaters. The movie itself is wonderful. The story is fascinating, the acting is great and the graphics are wonderful. All in all, Haeundae is at least as good as any of the best American disaster movies. I actually think it is better as it breaks the typical US disaster movie formula in many interesting ways. In short its very high quality and quite refreshing!Now comes the bad part. When I saw the movie at the theater, the English subtitles were iffy. Whoever translated like to use college level words and sophisticated sentence structures. This often resulted in the subtitles dropping off the screen before I could fully read them. For me, that wasn't too big a deal. Between the subtitles, my rudimentary understanding of Korean and context, I could figure out what was going on. I was really hoping the DVD would improve on this.The DVD English subtitles are different. Instead of being too complex, they are absolutely incoherent! To make matters even worse, the new subs give the characters Chinese names! I stopped watching after about 10 minutes as the DVD was giving me a headache.I really hope this gets fixed as Haeundae is a wonderful movie. Until I find a copy with good English subtitles, this will be my final comment.
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	Lyn Crost was a war correspondent for a Hawaii based newspaper. Not surprisingly, much of her work focused on the 100th Battalion/442d Regimental Combat Team which were filled with Japanese-Americans from Hawaii. She also became somewhat of an advocate for them after the war. This book is part of that advocacy.I was excited to find a book which appeared to conduct a comprehensive review of the war record of Japanese-American servicemen during World War II. Crost reveals in nice detail the little discussed activities of Nisei interpreters and intelligence specialists in the Pacific Theater. However, I found the chapters dealing with the all-Japanese combat units in Europe unreadable. These portions were tedious and annoying. This was caused mostly by Crost delving no deeper into actions beyond noting particular acts of heroism by certain Nisei Soldiers and concluding with which medal they received.Another problem is shoddy research in areas not directly related to the Nisei experience. Examples of this is a contention the Japanese could have used an occupied Hawaii to send planes to bomb the US Mainland (they had no planes with sufficient range) and a complaint German and Italian immigrants didn't receive the same treatment as their Japanese counterparts (patently false!).If you're considering purchasing this book, try to get a copy out of a library first. I wish I had!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	0	1	Like many earlier reviewers, I read this book when it first came out. I enjoyed greatly. Recently, I ran through it a second time. This time I didn't like it, not at all.First, a quick synopsis. The 1918 flu pandemic causes mutations in some Homo Sapiens. The mutated offspring are far superior to your basic model human both mentally and physically. Researchers secretly studying this decide the changes are so vast, these creatures are a new species within the Homo genus and name them Homo Post Hominem. Scientists estimate there are about 150,000 of these creatures in North America when a bio-nuclear war wipes out almost all Homo Sapiens (Hominems largely survive the attack as they are immune to disease). Candy Smith-Foster is one of the Hominem survivors and Emergence is her tale of survival and endeavors to reach other survivors.In many ways, this novel is a winner. Mr. Palmer has designed one of the most seamless post-holocaust settings available. Where it veers off the standard path (such as vehicles not damaged by EMP), the author gives rational explanations. I also found the Pittman Shorthand format used in most of the book daring and quite effective.My beef is with the characters. I have never met a more unsympathetic band of protagonists in a novel. Candy, the main protagonist, is an obnoxious twit. The first thing which struck me was Candy's lack of empathy. Despite the loss of everyone she would have known, she mourns for the loss of only three people; her adoptive mother, her father and her karate teacher (the last two may or may not be fellow Hominems). There are mentions of others but their loss seems to affect her about on the level of a misplaced McDonald's Happy Meal toy. Candy is not aware of her Hominem status at the beginning of the story but after she discovers it in her Karate teacher's parting letter, she morphs into quite the supremacist. While I am certain Mr. Palmer didn't mean to do this, page after page of my people/my tribe/poor H. sap./etc. gives the main protagonist the feel of a Hitlerjugend (though an unusually enlightened one). And Candy isn't the only problem. With one exception, all the Hominem protagonists come across to me as soulless and arrogant organic computers who I wouldn't want within a mile of me!As has been mentioned a few times previously, a sequel came out in serialized form a few years ago. I found a review of this series. As I suspected, Candy and company come across as even more obnoxious and arrogant jerks. Sorry, but I'm going to pass on that one!
A1DUT82FWQHUPX	1	1	Before getting to the meat of my review, I must begin with the global warming controversy surrounding this book. Personally, I am a skeptic in this matter and shied away from the novel for some time due to my perceptions. Rest assured this is NOT a "man made climate change" disaster story. Oh, its pretty obvious Baxter is sympathetic to such theories, but he has not written this as a cautionary tale. Mr. Baxter leaves the issue open to each of us to decide.With that out of the way, I've read a number of interstellar colonization novels and short stories over the years. The typical story I sampled has a well engineered and fully stock ship heading off to the stars with one or perhaps two speed bumps along the way. Baxter's Ark goes way off the beaten path. Because of various political, resource and time constrains, Baxter's Ark is a God awful mess. The launch method is less than optimal, the crew is very small, the ship's command structure is (in my opinion) imperfect, crew dynamics are a mess, the ship itself has a Rube Goldberg feel to it, little is known about the target planet, etc. But oh how these imperfections make for a great tale!I did find some problems. Most importantly, the first third of the story concerns the contruction of the ship and the mission along with following the collapse of civilization as dry land disappears. I found all this interesting, but at times was chafing for Baxter to light the candle. Also, there are some issues surrounding the ship Baxter never really explains. A minor one that irked me was the Ark coffee-holic navigator who seems to have a multi-decade supply of instant coffee! Where is all this being stored?Other than some small blemishes, this is a novel worth picking up.
A1DUW3S0GAKIVA	1	1	I purchased the Flowmaster 17208 Cat-back System as part of replacing my entire exhaust system on my 4.7L 2000 Dodge Durango. This is the best deal for the money and fit perfectly. It is very difficult to find reasonably priced cat back for a 4.7L 2000 Dodge Durango, so this seemed to be the best for the money. The product installed very easily, but I did need to purchase a 12" pieve of 2 1/2" pipe to connect the catalytic converter to the cat back system. I have had it installed for a few months now with no leaks and no problems whatsoever and it sounds awesome, but not too loud. Essentially it sounds stock at idle and low RPM driving at 25-35 MPH around town, but sounds much more aggressive at higher RPM ranges and during more aggressive driving. I also purchased this with the Flowtech 91944FLT Shorty Smog Headers from Amazon with these and am very happy with that product as well. The only disappointment in the entire system that I purchased was the Walker Exhaust 56086 Ultra Domestic Converter y-pipe which had to be aggressively tweaked to fit and had very inefficient non-mandrel bends in it. So if I were to do it all over again, I would certainly purchase the Flowmaster 17208 Cat-back System and the Flowtech 91944FLT Shorty Smog Headers again, but would use some other product instead of the Walker Exhaust 56086 y-pipe and catalytic converter that goes between them.
A1DUW3S0GAKIVA	1	1	I absolutely love this coffee maker. I have had some inexpensive and some very expensive one cup coffee makers over the years, but this one is my favorite. It is inexpensive, brews at proper temperature and allows you to use whatever kind of coffee you like without purchasing expensive pods. I also like that you can use any cup with this. Some of the one cup coffee makers will only work with the cup that comes with it where this one works with any cup. In fact I like this coffee maker so much I have purchased several "spares" in case B&D stops making this product. I have never actually had one fail, but I will say that after a few years of use, the permanent filter does wear out and tear from cleaning. Fortunately a new coffee maker is around $20 and with the price of a replacement filter plus shipping being around $15, you might as well buy a new coffee maker. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an excellent one cup coffee maker. These also make great gifts.
A1DUW3S0GAKIVA	0	0	I purchased this y-pipe with catalytic converter as part of replacing my entire exhaust system on my 4.7L 2000 Dodge Durango. I purchased this from Auto Shepherd via Amazon. I cannot say this product is anything special, it fit with some aggressive tweaking and the bends are not smooth mandrel bends they are very flow restricting. It is certainly not a performance item. If I had to redo it over again, I would not have purchased or used this product, but unfortunately needed to get this project done and I didn't feel like going through the effort in returning the item for something else. Also this item did not ship from Auto Shepherd in a box, it was just the naked exhaust pipe with a shipping label stuck on it, so it arrived with several dings in the flanges that I had to work out before installing it. I have had good luck with Auto Shepherd in the past, so this was also a disappointment. I did combine this with the Flowmaster 17208 Cat-back System and Flowtech 91944FLT Shorty Smog Headers both of which are excellent products and installed easily other than my having to purchase an additional 12" piece of straight pipe to connect the converter exit pipe to the Flowmaster inlet pipe. Net is if you are looking for something that will meet the need, this is fine, but if you are looking for a performance item or a high quality product, purchase something else.
A1DV4XVS1OWU1X	1	1	A few important (bullet) points:All of the musicians and actors are excellent in this work.The disc is a bit short (48 minutes).There is much more narration in Marita than in Peter &amp; the Wolf, and correspondingly longer gaps between the musical pieces. This can be good or bad, depending on what you want from the disc.The story is not as dramatic as Peter &amp; the Wolf. I was reminded most of Amy Tan's childrens' book The Moon Lady, which has some distant parallels. An evocative tale, simply with less drama.The Britten work coupled is Previn's excellent 1985 recording (previously released).If you already have Peter &amp; the Wolf (in some form or another), and in particular if you have a version that is not coupled with the Britten work, this is an excellent complement. But I would start with Peter &amp; the Wolf if you don't already have it.(Yes, there are many references to Prokofiev's Peter &amp; the Wolf in this review -- inevitable when reviewing a narrated musical work for children, I suppose.)
A1DV4XVS1OWU1X	1	1	I've held off on buying the Watchmen DVDs released so far, hoping for a "complete" set like this one (which I've now pre-ordered).

A1DVK2N7YU78YU	1	1	This is the first work of Billy Graham I have read. I enjoyed the book, it was easy to ready and it made you think as you read his words. A very nice book and enjoyable. I recommend it.
A1DVK2N7YU78YU	1	1	I enjoyed reading Marley and Me. I laughed at the book several times because I can relate, as I am an owner of 4 dogs.The only thing I found to be uncomfortable with is the fact that everytime they described Marley, you would think they owned a 250 pound Mastiff. Labs are medium sized dogs and if they are not fat and bred to standard, are appx 70 pounds or so. Not a huge dog.Some people commented that they didn't like how they put the dog in a garage, and they bought from a backyard breeder. But you know what, that happens to many novice owners and these things do happen. Why must a story be politically correct.I was just tired of hearing how much of a behemouth he was to the characters.If you love dogs and have had a few in your life, then you would enjoy this story. Easy read, a solid 4 star book, but I don't think it deserved all the hype it got. A good 4 star book though. Enjoy.
A1DVK2N7YU78YU	1	1	I use this brush on my short coated dogs, 3 pugs and a Doberman. They enjoy it and it removes dead hair and dirt. Great brush. The bristles are soft. The key is to not press hard on the animal with the brush. They key is the let the weight of the brush glide the bristles along the animals coat
A1DVLMNO6T9BNC	1	1	Just good writing. Keeps you interested, and I read during commercials on TV, because I can't wait to see what's going to happen
A1DVTUIF7LYKCH	0	0	I love Radiohead. I love documentaries and live shows about artists.This sucked, sucked, sucked. I'm not sure how on earth you can make a Radiohead concert dull, but this has certainly succeeded.Not recommended... if you want a copy, please let me know, and I'll gladly send you my copy for shipping & handling. Ick!!!!! They deserve better.
A1DVTUIF7LYKCH	0	0	For $20, I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but at $35, it's a piece of junk. Battery charge lasted for less than five minutes, and it didn't pick up dirt very well. Boo!
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	1	1	Arrhythmia recognition is the toughest part of EKG interpretation. Most books that teach it do so by illustrating each arrhythmia with a strip or two, usually using ideal examples. This approach leaves the reader ill prepared to recognize the variations that crop up in practice. The philosophy of this book is "you can't really know an arrhythmia unless you see it over and over".This book covers all the atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Each brief but thorough chapter concisely explains the electrophysiology of the abnormal rhythm, well illustrated by copious full color graphics, and ends with a series of analyzed strips and EKGs that show the arrythmia in all its possible presentations. As an example, I've always had a problem with recognizing atrial flutter at 2:1 conduction (anybody can recognize the 'saw tooth' pattern at higher ratios). After reading the chapter on the subject, I had it down cold.There are also quizzes and practice EKGs to drive home the skill, and the book has a corresponding Web site with further resources. Highly recommended.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	0	1	I'm a big fan of mind puzzles, and especially of the "whodunnit" type, often titled with a variation of "minute mysteries". They're particularly good if I have to read them at least twice to ascertain the subtle clues to solve the case and then proclaim to myself, "clever!".Thus, when I saw the title of this book, I figured I was in for a good challenge. Not so. In fact, this book was very disappointing. Although Weber did a good job of constructing the backstories, the "mysteries" themselves required little if any thought and basically the solution was apparent through common sense.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	1	1	Color atlases help you to see a lot in a concentrated period of time and this one is no exception. This book has a nice blend of illustrations to help understand the underlying pathology and copious color photos to help recognize their clinical manifestations.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	0	0	I got this book based on all the glittering stars and glowing reviews on this site. After having tortured myself by sticking with it to the inept end, I can only conclude that there must have been a tear in the fabric of the universe letting through the readers of Bizzaro world to write them, because this book stank. The premise sounded intriguing, but the actual plot, and I use the term very loosely here, was dull, had poor focus and little substance. The ending read like the author suddenly tired of writing the book and just abruptly finished it off. Instead of a mastermind, Mission impossible like plan that would actually be needed to take a major cruise liner, especially after the Achille Lauro, this book describes essentially a walk onto the ship that you'd have to be brain dead to believe. Fast paced? Unh,unh. Thriller? I don't think so. Put this on your 'avoid' list.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	1	0	"A picture is worth a thousand words" certainly holds true in medicine; you can read all you want about a physical finding, but nothing clarifies better than a picture. This book has over 1300 excellent color photos of various physical findings, pathological signs, and disease markers organized into sections that correspond to the various body parts: face, mouth, arms, legs, etc. They can be perused at random or consulted by specific body part to help with a diagnosis. Atlases usually have a sparcity of text, but the author manages to squeeze in a good amount of description and related information for enhanced learning. Great for students or veteran practitioners.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	0	0	When the day after tomorrow is yesterday, today will be as far from Wednesday as today was from Wednesday when the day before yesterday was tomorrow. What is the day after this day? Got the answer, yet?...No? Well, if you don't have the patience or the interest to work through this, then you won't care for this movie. The movie is about a couple of engineers who stumble onto an elementary method of time travel while working on another project in their garage on their off time. The plot then literally grows as convoluted and hard to understand as the previous question. Now, I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies that present a challenging plot, that make you think. The BIG problem with this one is that to really understand it, you have to watch it several times, and even take notes, BUT, it's very slow and excruciatingly boring - almost the entire movie consists of two people talking and standing around, so it's not really worth the effort to anyone but the most die-hard geek. It also suffers a lot from poor production values, as it was done as an indie film on a shoe-string budget (I read $7k), and has the dismal look and poor sound of a student film.
A1DW6ZFEH3LGCZ	0	1	The name of this book is very deceptive and makes it sound like it contans follow up stories in the vein of those in Deaver's book "Twisted" (which is also available in audio format). Lo and behold, it's actually just more stories taken from that book. This audio book should have been named something like "Nocuturne and other stories from Twisted". Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only one to have been duped. The stories in "Twisted" are good, but jeers to the publisher for pulling this fast one.
A1DW77GSA6EDPX	1	1	j'attendais la parution sur DVD, mais a la projection de cet enregistrement, apres l'audition du CD, je n'ai pu r&eacute;sister plus longtemps! Tout au plus, je regretterais une trop pr&eacute;sente r&eacute;f&eacute;rence a Gould, que souligne la technique consomm&eacute;e de Monsaingeon . Quelles prises de vue saisissantes, la prise de son de cristal! On ne peut que rendre un fervent hommage au travail consid&eacute;rable et au talent inoui non seulement de Piotr, mais de tous les techniciens. Des DVD de musique classique de cette qualit&eacute; sont si rares. Merci pour ces instants de r&eacute;el bonheur.
A1DW77GSA6EDPX	0	1	rarement vu un dvd musical aussi ex&eacute;crable depuis les images aux coloris d&eacute;lav&eacute;s sans relief, des prises de vue de mauvais amateur, sautantes et tournantes, donnant le tournis , un envahissement des paysages au d&eacute;triment des vues de l'orchestre , une mise en sc&egrave;ne de patronage, des ballets paysans ridicules , une absence d'ensemble aussi bien des ballets que musical renforc&eacute;e par de fr&eacute;quents passages non synchronis&eacute;s: on est alors tent&eacute; de chercher le repos visuel et de fermer enfin les yeux, mais alors la lourdeur, le manque de finesse et de po&eacute;sie de l'interpr&eacute;tation dont ce chef tcheque ne nous avait pas habitu&eacute;, surtout dans un rle visuel grandiloquent insupportable .. enfin bref &agrave; eviter cette horreur et sinon, &agrave; jeter !!!
A1DW77GSA6EDPX	0	1	Aix en Provence est maintenant abonn&eacute; a des mises en scenes soit disant modernes mais affligeantes et ici non soutenue par des chanteurs de seconde zone en particulier un contre tenor sorti d ou on ne sait ou et qui ferait mieux d y retourner
A1DWAKP6RXKA96	1	1	I love Jillian Michaels first off, i think she challenges you and gives you intense workouts. This is no different. Level 1 was quite easy for me, so i combined level 2 and 3 to get a great workout! I was sweating up a storm when i finished. Only a few minor things to say:First these are not 20 min workouts. I have timed them and they come out to more like 27 min each! I was surprised to find out that after combining 2 workouts that i was almost at 1 hour when i thought it would only take 40 min! So i didn't like that, it was very misleading.The second is that she seems to overly favor the girl who is doing the advanced moves and makes it seem like if you are doing the modified moves then you are not getting as good a workout, etc.But overall i love this DVD and keep it in my rotation!
A1DWAKP6RXKA96	0	1	I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's.
A1DWAKP6RXKA96	0	1	Definitely a good beginner workout, but not for the intermediate to advanced. Not challenging, didn't get my heart rate up, too low intesity for me.
A1DWAKP6RXKA96	0	0	Ok, I was really looking forward to this video because it got such rave reviews....but let me tell you. Unless you are superman and have immense strength, this video is not for you! I am an avid excersiser and think i'm fairly strong, but this video was impossible for me to do! I was in pain trying to do these impossible moves! I tried this video several times thinking i would get the hang of it, but to no avail. Please don't waste your money on this video, you will be in for a big disappointment.
A1DWVFE4S34L37	1	1	I have followed Jean-Luc for over 20 years, and never stops amazing me!His latest give more feeling and beat than the last few albums. He delivers much better live, but this is one of his best studio albums! He has a top notch band right now on this album, and he has toured with them extensively.A must have for any JLP or jazz fan!
A1DWVFE4S34L37	0	0	If you pay less than a dollar for this, you got your money's worth.The description states that it's in color - it's not. It's a copy of an old TV appearance in Europe, and a very low copy. On DVD, all low quality aspects are very apparent.This is not a "live concert" as stated. It's a staged TV show with a studio audience.All "live" aspects are edited out, such as conversations between songs. Mostly because the host only speaks in French. He even comes out at the end and sings "Reach Out and I'll be there"...in French! He is disturbing! For the humor and historical value of backup dancers in white go-go boots, it's worth the dollar! You have the Supremes in beaded gowns, and then these go-go dancers show up behind them. Just tasteless French TV!Even for die-hard fans (like me), this is disappointing. Mostly because the description is misleading.- It's not a concert performance- It's not in color- Video quality can't get much lower
A1DWVFE4S34L37	0	0	This book starts at 1956 - the beginning of the LP record. This is the last fair treatment of album music this book gives our American music history.I have just finished reading the book and listening to...all of the music up through 1969. Interesting that not ONE album from Motown is mentioned. However about 30 come from the British invasion. Before the Beatles, there were the Supremes who were the biggest force in American music, and groundbreaking race breakers. No mention. Marvin Gaye...no mention. But every psychadelic crap artist is listed, including imitations from Britain, where the psychadelic movement was an imitation anyway. I'm inclined to believe that intense druggie music writers compiled this book. Alas, the General Editor is from Rolling Stone magazine.Very disturbing, and very poor example. He should have thought this through a bit more before printing. Now, I can't read anymore of it now that it's obviously a complete farce.
A1DWXYMCO3KZXT	1	1	I'll start off by saying that I haven't played any other racing games - and this game (Juiced) is my teenage son's game. I watched him play it a couple of times - thought it looked like fun - and decided to try it myself.Apparently this games key feature is "respect" - it's what the focus of the game is. To compete in certain races, you need a certain level of respect with other drivers. And different drivers have different criteria for granting respect. Some value good driving, some value agressive betting, some value the ability to win pink slip races.As you gain respect with different drivers, you can race them for pink slips (they'll call you on your in-game cell phone and ask you to race for pinks), invite you to host a challenge at their "track", among other things.The one review who said that this was more of a budgeting game must not have been winning many, if any races. Yes, as time goes on, there are less and less "free" (i.e. you don't have to pay and entry fee to race). However, if you're a reasonably good driver, you can pay the entry fee for a race, and if you win (and sometimes - depending upon the race - if you place second) you can still make money on the race. Even when you figure in repairing your car.Obviously, the further you go in the race, the more you can make winning races. I've been playing off and on for a couple of months, and I just won a "class 1" race where the prize money was $450,000.One of the other nice aspect, from my standpoint, is building a "crew" of other drivers who want to drive as part of your team. Personally, I suck at cornering - I go in to fast - I usually hit the barricade - and generally beat up my car, and don't do very well with races that have a lot of cornering.My solution? Have one of my crew race for me. Granted, I cannot bet with other drivers in the race, but I can win the prize money if my driver comes in first (my car - my entry fee - my prize money).It's also pretty fun to develop a series of cars. The way it works in Juiced is there are 8 classes of cars. The class is solely based upon the cars base horsepower (BHP). From 0 BHP to 199 is class 8, 200 BHP to 299 is class seven, all the way up to 900 BHP up to 1200 (I think) BHP is class one. The highest I've gotten a car's BHP is up to 1043 (a "prototype" Dodge Viper). There are several different types of upgrades you can purchase for your cars. Also, to "unlock" new upgrades, you have to win races. The different parts are fuel filter (I think), shocks, muffler, brakes, tires, turbo, and nitrous oxide (NOS or NO2). Each part has 3 different levels, and a "prototype" level. Obviously, the better the parts on your car (except for brakes, shocks and nitrous oxide) the higher your BHP, thus the higher the class of your car.There are basically three different types of races, circuits (go around a course a given number of times), point-to-point (follow a course only one tme) and sprints (a usually straight stretch where you do three heats). Since I suck at cornering so bad, I've started sticking to sprints.Also, you have the option to race for "pinks" - pink slips, or the ownership of cars. Basically, if you lose the race, you lose the car. And, it always seems to be for your most powerful (i.e. highest class) car.One neat - though initially I didn't like it - feature is that the XBox version of the game (don't know if the other versions do it or not) does an "autosave" before a race. I don't know specifically how it works, but if you're racing, and loose your nerve - or get pissed off - and shut the game off - you're still screwed - you still lost the race. Apparently the game writes a little file or something that says "he's racing this race, for this amount of money, on this track" - and if it doesn't get the little piece of info that says "he won this race" - then obviously you lost.Like I said, I've been playing it on and off for a couple of months, I just started playing it again a week or so ago - and I've gotten to the point where I have $3,000,000 in my account, about a dozen cars, 8 of them are prototypes - which includes 5 prototype class one Dodge Vipers (every upgrade is a prototype) that I won in pink slip races.All in all, for somebody who's never played a racing game before - I think it's pretty fun! Even for an old guy!
A1DWXYMCO3KZXT	1	1	Let me start off by saying that I've played this game (well - o.k. - not EXACTLY this game) on the Xbox, and I enjoy that one a lot (I've got over $10 Million dollars and over 30 cars, including 10 prototype Dodge Vipers that I've won in pink slip races) - and that was the main reason for trying out this game.Let me also say that I'm not a huge fan of racing style games - in fact, Juiced is really the only one I've played. Other racing games might be better, more realistic, whatever - I really don't know. I can't compare this game to other racing games - so I won't bother.Largely, this game is pretty much the same as the Xbox version. Granted, the names of the other crew leaders are different, as are their crews and their "turfs". But, as you're racing, you'll recognize sections of the various tracks from the first (Xbox) game.The game operates pretty much the same as the first one, you start racing, you have to build up respect from various crew leaders to attend their races, then race them for pinks, them host at their tracks, etc. Also, different crew leaders are impressed by different things, one by your betting, one by your crews abilities, one by your sprints, one by your circuit racing, etc. Do poorly in a race (or even if you don't come in first) and you'll see your respect go down.I've been playing the game for about a week, and I've seen all of the crew leaders except for one (the last guy who would be similar to Carlos in the first one). It seems to me that the Crew Leaders aren't as dorky as they were in the first one, and sometimes they're actually kind of funny (one guy, Hayden, asks you to drop him off at his girlfriends house after he lost a pink slip race to you - then he says "maybe I better not since I lost my car" - yeah, it's not exactly ROFLMAO, but it's humorious). So far, there's nobody annoying as Jack was in the first one (he's the blond haired whinner).Some reviewers (for magazines) have complained that it's more difficult to race on the PSP and that the control offered by the analog stick isn't as good as on the Xbox. That might be true, however, I wouldn't be a good judge of that. I tend to stick to sprints and circuit races on oval tracks because I can't corner worth a crap. In the Xbox, I kept on putting the car into the guard rails while cornering - at lower classes, I haven't been having that much of a problem cornering on the PSP version - but I still prefer sprints and racing on ovals.The layout of the game (the menus, etc.) are a little different in Eliminator - I'm assuming this is because of the smaller screen real estate. They're using a side-to-side screens for going through your cars, and the cars at the dealership. It's frustrating because it's a lot slower when you're in the workshop - you have to load the picture of each car before you can scroll to the next one. When you're in the dealership, at least you can scroll through the names quicker, though every so often (about 10 or so cars) it stops, and loads the picture of the car before you can keep scrolling.Another different thing about the game is the betting. In the first one there were several different amounts you could bet (usually 4 or 5), but as you keep on beating them, those bet amounts keep going down. Also, you could purposely bet higher than the persons "comfort range" and gain respect (not a lot - b ut some).These features are different in Eliminator. As far as I can tell, bet amounts don't go down in Eliminator as you keep beating the driver. Also, you are offered 3 different betting amounts - that's it. However, you can scroll between the different drivers and see what their bet amounts are before you actually bet - so you can get the highest bet amount (if that's what you want to do). But you can't purposely "overbet" somebody and get a respect increase. Though I've only done it once, I think that it's easier to not bet on the race in Eliminator than it was in the first one. That way if you're just racing to unlock mods, and don't think you're going to win (you have no turbo or nitro), you don't have to worry about losing a bet as well.Another big change is that you don't see the respect screen unless you select it. Respect, and the respect screen does seem to operate pretty much the same.Also, you don't have to pay to fix up your car after each race - which is nice. Even if you won, and didn't hit anybody, or put the car into the wall, you still had to pay to fix your car. Not so in Eliminator. Also, a "clean racing" bonus is offered, though I haven't figured out yet if it's for not hitting anybody, or not putting it into the wall.Another change, that I don't believe was possible in the first game, is that you can level up a car (a little bit) after you buy it, but you haven't actually raced it yet. Granted, you can't get turbo or nitro until you've raced at least once - but you can level up a little, and add some mods to your car. Once you start racing, you unlock mods, and can trick out your car more, making it better,The mod system works pretty much the same as in the first game. On the engine mods, there's stock, levels and prototype, on the body mods, there's usually three levels, except for the tail, which seems to have more.That said, I do have two big complaints about the Juiced:Eliminator. First, the load times are awful - everytime you goto a different section, it takes a while to load. Second, and to me, this is a big one, when a crew member is racing for you, you have to pick the level they're going to race at (high, medium or low) at the begining of the race, and you don't get to change it real-time like you could in the first game. This, in my opinion, makes it a lot more difficult for your crew members to win races (though not impossible). In the first version, I would place my crew members at high at the begining of the race, and as they started having trouble (their name, position and level would change from yellow to orange to red), you could switch them down to medium until their color went back down to yellow. Also, you could put them on medium (or even low) when they were cornering (when they're more likely to spin out at the high level), and then put them back on high on straighaways. Also, if they're comfortably winning the race, you could switch them down to medium - and not have to worry (as much) about them loosing control and spinning out.In Eliminator, you pick the level at the begining of the race, and really, there's nothing else to do until the race is over. You might as well sit the game down and goto the bathroom, get a drink, whatever, until the race is over. That's kind of lame.Overall though, I do think this is an enjoyable game - and probably worth keeping (I'm renting it through Gamefly). If you enjoyed playing it on the Xbox, and have a PSP - I suggest you get it. If you didn't like it on the Xbox - you won't like it on the PSP.
A1DWXYMCO3KZXT	0	0	My wife bought this book for me - and as I started to read it - several times I became confused - trying to figure out where, exactly, the book was headed.It seems to me that the book, along with the main character, wanders - and switches from this to that. Leaving you wondering why exactly you're reading a story that seems to have no purpose.You're supposed to be hearing the story as the main character recalls it - but then you are shown scenes apart from him - that do not involve him. You're given background and history about other characters - but again, how is he supposed to know this things - if they haven't told them to him (and in the story - they haven't).The main character isn't very admirable either. He's not nearly as smart as he thinks he is. Despite claiming that he doesn't care about many things - he seems to have a lot of knowledge about them. He seems to have no control over his sex drive - and has to "bed" every attractive woman that crosses his path - all the while maintaining his "love and devotion" for some ideal woman who will never have him. Apparently an attractive woman with some nice perfume is all it takes to make him go love sick.The love scenes in look like they were pulled out of a Harlequin romance - and make me feel like I'm reading some tawdry book that should have Fabio on the cover.I'll probably finish it out of curiosity - but it'll be more of a chore than something enjoyable.
A1DWXYMCO3KZXT	1	1	Overall all - this was a very good book, offering a lot of excellent insights into Washington, his life, and how he acted in different situations.One of the conclusions I came to, while reading this book, is that Washington is probably the only person who could have successfully served as the first President of the U.S. - he was very fair minded, didn't take sides, and didn't use his influence in areas he felt were inappropriate (too bad today's politicians don't act the same way!). I believe were any other of the major political figures of the day our first President, the nation would have fallen apart, and would be a collection of states, and not the country we are today.That being said, I do have one complaint about the book. The book was written in sections - instead of in a strictly linear (timeline) fashion. As a result, occasionally you'll get done with one section, and then goto the next section, and end up going backwards in time.I can understand why the author did this - I'm sure he felt like some subjects needed to be covered by themselves, and not just thrown into a timeline with everything else. However, by doing it this way, sometimes you get a bit confused in regards to how things fall on the timeline.Otherwise - a very good book.
A1DWZ0SQRQBNEY	1	1	Just watched it on cable & I LOVED it!!! Didn't want it to end!It reminds me of Chicago.I will buy the DVD.Whoever thinks that Christina can't act~ why does it matter when she makes the movie come alive with that amazing voice! W O W !!!
A1DWZ0SQRQBNEY	1	1	When I received my Little Cado it was almost dead. It was no fault of the Nursery;UPS had it sitting in their 100 degree truck for days! I really loved the little tree & was trying to revive it with the help of John from the nursery. The little tree died. When I spoke to John about it he didn't ask any questions & refunded me!This nursery has a wonderful relationship with its customers;something that you hardly ever see these days!I gave this nursery 5 stars because I know that this would have been a beautiful tree if it would had survived.The packing was EXQUISITE~ as is their SERVICE!If you go on to their WebSite they have beautiful everything & very unique trees that you cannot find elsewhere.I will order again when it gets cooler so that it won't suffer again while being shipped in this New Orleans 200 degree Heat.Thank You Cliftons~ I will tell everyone about you!!!
A1DX5LXYXH5VE6	1	1	This is the first Elizabeth George I have read and it was outstanding. Fast-paced and wonderfully written - the story sucks you in and keeps you guessing all the time. Lynley, Havers, St. James are a great set of characters whose stories I'd like to follow through the series.
A1DX5LXYXH5VE6	1	1	Really enjoyed this. The story unfolds beautifully - plenty of suspense and unexpected events. Wonderfully haunting setting. In addition to the detectives, Elizabeth George has created a great cast of characters with plenty of depth and intriguing motivations... a great read.
A1DX5VAY7840F7	1	1	Having just emerged from Barbara Tuchman's "Guns of August", it was a relief to get the big picture view of the entire war, across all theaters (Western Front, Eastern Front, Italy, Balkans, Middle East). With so many distractions available, Howard does a great job of guiding us through the ebb and flow of the war. It was particularly helpful to get some insight into the domestic scene of the various combatants and how that affected the military outcome. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants (a) an intro that whets the appetite for further investigation, or (b) an overview to fill out some gaps in 20th century history.
A1DX5VAY7840F7	0	0	We picked this book for our book club after reading Barbara Tuchman's Proud Tower and August 1914. We thought we had a decent layman's understanding of European history. AJP Taylor launches into this book expecting that you're well versed in some of the controversies around the unification of Germany, not to mention the various characters who lead European countries at the time. The book is full of dismissive remarks like, "There are some who say xxx, but they misunderstand yyy." Taylor obviously came into this project with a few axes to grind.Taylor does a decent job of getting inside Bismarck's head but fails to give any real insight into the behavior of the Germans around him. Why did Wilhelm I really tolerate Bismarck's long absences from Berlin? Why couldn't the Bundesrat rally behind any alternative leaders? How is that a country which rallied so forcefully behind Wilhelm II in 1914 and Hitler 20 years later allowed itself to live within Bismarck's limited ambitions after the defeat of France in 1871? And what of Germany's incredible commercial success under Bismarck, which Taylor entirely ignores?We all found this book very frustrating, and could not recommend it, despite Taylor's occasionally winning prose style.
A1DX74BN2XCS0A	1	1	It's been 2 weeks now since i got this perfume. Have been putting it daily, and smell is good if not great. I read the previous reviews for this perfume and noted that certain people reviews as something phenomenal. The smell is somewhat familiar to me but cannot recollect which perfume has this same smell. I read that Joop smells the same as this but i havnt smelled Joop till now.As far as my taste goes this perfume is good smelling, lasts for somwhere around 4 to 5 hours, can use it for daily office wear. Not too powerful or too weak.Would certainly recommend to people.Only drawback is the quantity, would have been nice if it was a 100 ml rather than a 75 ml, because the price($34 approx) isnt anyhwere near cheap.
A1DX74BN2XCS0A	1	1	Good product and protects from wind and cold excellently. But weighs a lot more than expected..so would be tough to carry on hand when you dont want to use
A1DX8NUNXOLZ0F	1	0	I bought my first one about a year ago to use when I don't have my laptop docked and only replaced the battery once after about 9 months (of course 70% of my laptop use is in the dock with using my #1 mouse - MX Revolution.) I just bought a second one for my wife, since she uses mine every chance she gets.
A1DX8NUNXOLZ0F	0	1	I ordered this thinking I was going to get a 2' by 4' access door, what was shipped was a 8" by 8" door.
A1DX8NUNXOLZ0F	1	1	This year will be the 3rd football season to use this at the tailgate. It is great for powering our tv, dish receiver, and stereo. We even plug in a crockpot every once a while. We replaced a Coleman powermate and the noise difference is night and day. We can usually make it about 6 hours on a tank of gas, so it is very efficient.
A1DXA0U9N9HT4U	1	1	Assuming that most ELP fans will be purchasing this album for the twentieth time exclusively for the surround mix disc, you should be warned that you won't get the entire album in surround format. While there are plenty of reasons for the ELP fan and completist to get this version, it probably wouldn't be for this new mix on its own. The net effect of What's-His-Name's remix is that of a sort of "exploded diagram" of the album, which reveals that the sum of its parts, more discernible though they may be, do not rise to the level of the original two-channel masterpiece. There's some exciting bonus material (which ELP fans have been told for years didn't exist) which will probably be worth the quite reasonable price of this three-disc set, but keep your expectations grounded: ultimately, this is at its core another reissue of a forty-year-old analogue recording, not the second coming of Art Rock.
A1DXA0U9N9HT4U	0	1	For some obscure, techno-geek reason, some blu-ray discs won't function on certain blu-ray DVD players, Sony chief among them. I tried two different copies of this blu-ray and encountered the same malfunction, which was major distortion in the 7.1 DTS audio of the film itself. Back to the regular DVD release for me: some technical advancement is functionally a step backward.
A1DXBFNRMNO7AT	1	1	I got my first package of the chili mix, from my sister-in-law. I did not know what I was in for, but gave it a try. I made it according to directions, and threw in some browned hamburger. The smell filled the room, as it boiled, and simmered. I was not disappointed, with the way it tasted. I don't like my chili spicey, and this one fit the bill exactly, as it has just the right amount of spices and herbs. I have tried a lot of chili, in a lot of places, and I will say that this is the best MIX that I have ever tried. I would definitely recommend this for camping trips. The 9.8 ounce bag, says that it makes 8 servings, but depending on how hungry your crew is, might only feed four.
A1DXBFNRMNO7AT	1	1	If you are looking for this to be very accurate, then you need to use the lithium batteries. Because of the cold temps here, the cheaper batteries do not work as well. Maybe where it doesn't get in the minus temps, the Rayovac batteries will be okay, but not here in NE. The sensor needs to be put in a location, that is out of the sun, and out of reach of your pets, and children. Which makes for a little decision making time, on your part.
A1DXBFNRMNO7AT	1	1	I heard about this singer thru my mother. The song "Footsteps" was to be incorporated into her lesson at her church. I had the opportunuity to listen to it, because I purchased the cd, and mailed it to her. It is a very good song, with almost whatever you intend to use it for. With the passing of a loved one, or with scriptures being read at church. Most Christian music, doesn't enthrall me all that much, but Mr. O'Donnell, has a very nice, easy listening voice. The rest of the songs are not without merit, as it seems that he has chosen the right ones to be presented on this cd. One should enjoy the lasting effects, of the entire album....
A1DXBFNRMNO7AT	1	1	I purchased mine, in 1994. It has been a very reliable hot coffee container. I pretreat it, in the morning, with boiling water, for 5-10 minutes. I work in an area with very little heat, during the winter, and from starting work, at 6 a.m. until quitting time, 2:30, the coffee reamins hot. Not boiling hot, but just hot enough, for the drive home. After 13 years of loyal use, the grab/carry handle finally broke, where it attaches to the top of the thermos. I guess the one drawback, is that there is no way to replace that part of it. So, I either have to purchase a new one, or use the nylon strap that came with it. Another problem that I encountered, is the screw top. It has two arrows, that are barely visible. I have taken a black and red magic maker, and outlined the arrows, thus allowing me to see where the arrows are, and therby see that I only have to turn the top once for the coffee to pour out.
A1DXJLLYHQAYXB	1	1	This is a really good book. It focuses on different types of second wave feminist organizations that started out volunteer, and then staff were hired later in the movement. Domestic violence and sexual assault organizations were part of the focus. Good book for understandings the benefits and pitfalls of alternative business models, like consensus decision-making. It's a pragmatic way that young feminists can learn about the history of the movement and to look for areas of improvement.
A1DXJLLYHQAYXB	1	1	I love memoirs, and so many are about child abuse, sexual abuse, or the like, and this one has all that and more. With parents who were both severely mentally ill, being forced to manipulate doctors with her mother in order to get attention and treatment. This book has another aspect in every memoir like this, that people never really change. In fact, they stay the same, which is both comical but sad. This is better than the Glass Castle memoir.
A1DXJLLYHQAYXB	0	0	This book is ridiculous. It has nothing to do with being "conscious." Thankfully it only cost 50 cents (plus shipping), but it's no wonder that the used ones start at 1 cent.
A1DXOQJ2OYPD2H	1	1	Replaced the original ones perfectly and made the screen door work like new again. The screen door gets a lot of use and isnot perfectally aligned anymore and will need these replaced again in the future.
A1DXOQJ2OYPD2H	0	0	Replaced the 25 year old original equipment ones with these. They worked well for less than a year then lost the ability tokeep the lid up. The lid started to close slowly by itself at first and in a few months it acts like the lift support is missing. Wentback to the cut-off broom stick. Turned out to be a poor value.
A1DXOQJ2OYPD2H	1	1	We bought it for a stray cat that spends most of her time around our house. At first she wouldn't go near this matthinking it was a trap and would either leave or sit on the ground. Finally she must have given it a chance and she'ssitting on it quite often and looks very happy, which makes us happy. It must work well and once they try it theyseem to like it.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	1	1	I have owned a black pair of these for almost 5 years and they have held up so great that I just bought another pair on Amazon because they are hard to find in my size in stores. So far they are the same quality as my old ones and are very comfortable. My only complaint is that the Reef symbol on the top of the sandal wore off in a week but I don't really care because you can't see it when your wearing them anyways.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	0	0	I purchased this show because I am an avid football fan and based on the positive reviews. I watch a lot of shows and movies and know the difference between good and bad. This show is somewhat of a joke to me to be honest. Most reviews comment on how good the acting is and I find it laughable. The stories are not engaging and 90% of the players don't even resemble what NFL players look like. I am shocked at how well this show is reviewed and I feel the exact opposite. If you like good shows with a good story and acting do not buy this.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	1	1	How can anyone not like this movie? It's hilarious but still has some seriousness to it. I love Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep together, it just works.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	1	0	The second season has a lot more going on than season 1 and isn't as boring. The Blu-Ray quality is still poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own. Hopefully season 3 will be better quality.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	1	0	As I stated in the title the show starts extremely slow but gets very good in the last few episodes of the season. The Blu-Ray quality is poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own.
A1DXS4XEIW98ZR	0	0	It is well made and looks nice. It barely holds the .38 shells without dropping them unless it's just sitting on a table. It does not work for late model Taurus 85. The cylinder release gets in the way and you can only get the bullets in about a half inch or so and release them and hope they fall in. Still faster than manually loading. Haven't decided if I'm going to return yet or not.
A1DXTJKP7FTBAE	0	1	First and foremost the production on this CD is fantastic, right up their with NIN's The Fragile. But like The Fragile, the music/songs do not go anywhere. It seems as though Jon Crosby is holding himself back lyrically and musically; too bad really because he appears to have tremendous talent that is unfocused. The vocals are derivative/reminiscent of Jim Morrison/Bono and the samples are the same ones heard on records by Enigma(I'm Dying)/The God Machine(Touched). The music and rhythms heard on this album are the same ones WE have all heard before.The cello on &quot;Flames&quot; is the only redeeming musical statement on this album.
A1DXTJKP7FTBAE	0	0	Industrial rock music can either be really great(NIN, Ministry, Godflesh) or really banal(KMFDM, Dead World, etc..). With this album the Genitorturers fall closer to the compost end of the said music spectrum.First, the sound and production of the album is completely unbalanced. It isn't until after the song, "Asphyxiate", does this album begin to sound decent, full, thick and at most vaguely interesting. The worst example is their AC/DC cover of "Squealer"; completely awful and two dimensional. Also, the songs "Sin City" through "Squealer" sound tinny when the volume is maxed out-tinnitus sufferers beware!Second, the lyrics are a...attempt at trying to sound intelligent and philosophical. The lyrics read like what you would find on the back of a 5th graders notebook. The sexual subject matter is the same kind of controversy found on the Jerry Springer show(except Springer is more convincing).And lastly, this is just another mediocre pseudo-industrial rock band with a rehashed concept with rehashed music. Don't waste your money on purchasing this "new"; save a couple of bucks and find a used copy... Or even better save your money and don't buy this at all.
A1DYOP6WB3O8JB	1	1	This movie is a delightful romantic comedy, different from Janeane Garafalo's usual fare. I was surprised at how much I liked this flick, mainly set in lovely Ireland, as you could probably tell. Marcy goes to Ireland to find the roots of Sen. John McGlory, only to end up there upon the approach of the local Matchmaking Festival. In walks scraggly Sean into the story, who left the city boy life behind to move to rural Ireland. I do have to say I just love David O'Hara, who has been in several other movies and more recently on TV's The District. Is a match made in heaven? Well you'll just have to watch it yourself!
A1DYOP6WB3O8JB	1	1	Greater than Braveheart? I have to admit I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie because all of the hype. I didn't see it until about 3 years after it was released. One bored Sunday night resulted in plopping myself down in front of the tube to finally see this flick. I quickly scolded myself for not watching it earlier! Braveheart is the ultimate epic of modern times and Mel Gibson is a genius!! Not only is the story of William Wallace, yes there is a bit of artistic liberty, captivating but the scenery/atmosphere absolutely MADE this movie.The vision of Mr. Gibson, John Toll and the music is simply astonishing. Everytime I watch it is like the first time. The movie left me in awe, as I'm sure it will do for most viewers. Yes, I do have other favorite movies but this is definitely in the Top 10.
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	It was just so good -- so good you'll have to go right out and get the next one in hardback because you can't wait. This is escapist literature at it's peak -- You'd have to be downright grumpy not to love it!
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	I read legal thrillers to escape. I love them -- but with a bit of guilty pleasure as one consuming junk food for the mind. Not this one though. This book combines the thrill of escapist reading with a wholesome and affirming message that feeds the heart and mind.
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	0	1	I've liked every Griffin book I've read to date, until this one -- which I enjoyed until the end. No spoilers here -- but it utterly ruined it for me. I wont read the rest of this series. Try the Presidential Agent Series instead -- awesome!
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	Peacock was DEEPLY brutally honest, vulnerable and "real" long before it was in fashion. This album is incredible, the music is ... well timeless sounds cliche, but TIMELESS and the lyrics are deep and intense.The song Forgiveness is so wildly good, listening to it is an "activity." I can't do anything else at the same time. It's one of those songs that you feel like running around and playing for everyone just so they feel it.What a brilliant musician - what a "real" Christian - what a testimony to what the Holy Spirit can do with a mere man.
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	If you're in the midst of successful weight loss and close to reaching your goal, get this scale! You wont want to quit the fun of improving your health and this scale gives you a measureable way to keep working on it even when you're only maintaining your weight. It calculates body fat %!
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	One of my favourite books, by I think my very favourite author ~ This tale offers immediately useful and intensely practical wisdom for *anyone* yet childlike enough to receive it. It was one of those *life-transforming* books for me, and (no exaggeration) I have been happier ever since I read it over a year ago -- because it is the sort of book you not only read , but DO!A note regarding the publisher -- this version is well done. I purchased one from a lesser publisher prior to buying this one and apparently all the text had been scanned and the result was illegible. I'm not sure why they found it fit to sell, but I did not find it fit to read. At any rate, this one does not suffer from such poor workmanship and offers a clear window through for the glory of the message to shine through!
A1DYPUTMR2LEW2	1	1	If you've ever looked for a proper guide to fifties homemaking (as opposed to the disdainful, sarcastic and deceptive models posted for the entertainment of scoffers), this is it. There are points here and there where I find Andelin's advice manipulative and disingenuine, but they take little away from the whole impact of this book of very good advice for homemakers who intend to do their job with excellence and integrity. So take what you like and leave the rest, including the naysayers, who will think what they will.
A1DYZZGA0B1PBQ	0	1	The movie on it's own merit was alright, but I read the book first. The movie pales in comparison to the book. There are scenes in the movie that never took place. In fact the movie was kind of hard to stomach. The real Donnie Brasco, (Joe Pistone) tells a much more gripping story in the book. Maybe the movie should have been whacked along with Sonny Black.
A1DYZZGA0B1PBQ	1	1	I won't go into detail of either film since others have already done that.In every way Wyatt Earp is far more historically accurate.Although I'm no Costner fan I thought he did a fairly good jobas well as the rest of the cast, Dennis Quaid was very good.History is usually less exciting than hollywood would have us think.Val Kilmore's "Doc" was over the top for me, especially when he fired 3 shots insuccession from a double barrel shot gun , "happens alot in westerns".If you want snappy dialog with a bunch of "pretty people" go with Tombstone.If you want the grimness and a more accurate portrayalof the life and events of Wyatt Earp then choose, well... you know.
A1DZ4UWMODUUOD	1	1	I needed a 20" white gold chain to hold a rather heavy large chunky white gold pave diamond pendant. This chain is perfect. The cable links are strong and well made. Additionally, an unexpected surprise is the exceptional shine of this chain. It really sparkles all on it's own! Highly recommend!The lobster clasp could have been a tad larger but overall a really great chain for the price.
A1DZ4UWMODUUOD	1	1	This bracelet is well made and well weighted. It is a simple classic bracelet that will go with everything. I, unfortunately had to return mine. The 7.2 " size was a bit too small for my taste. I usually wear a 7.5". I was bummed as I really like it. Good quality for a really good price at the time ($109).
A1DZ4UWMODUUOD	0	0	People...don't waste your money. This nozzle is definitely not all that! Go to your local home store and pay half as much and I bet you'll get a better nozzle. It does have decent construction but other than that not worth it. The spray selection is rudamentary at best. Does not spay a hard jet stream like video presentation shows.
A1E079MVIIMWOK	0	1	I have had one of these units now for about 3 years and have had...get this...5 liners. Yes, you read that right, I said five. They have all cracked on the bottom of the unit as if my cooker overheats on the bottom. Well, I have called Kitchen-Aid so often now that they know me and they replaced the cooker portion once too but still the liners cracked. They kept questioning me as to how I was using the unit (believe me, I know how to use these)and I kept reassuring them that I was not putting a chilled liner in a hot base, etc... Also, it is true that there is a continuing problem with these liners and that there is a thread about it on their site- I have contributed my 2-cents worth there, also.I am so very fed up with this unit and so I started wondering about an alternative material like cast iron for a liner. Makes sense right? Well with some cooler weather this week, I was pondering this again and I happened to see an episode of Simply Ming and he had a unit that he braised beef right on the gas cooktop then put in the liner. This episode and my desires kicked off an investigation on the web and I learned that he had the All-Clad Deluxe model cooker which I can't find on here, :(. I did find it at Williams Sonoma for $279, ouch! The liner is thick solid cast aluminum rather than cast iron. I am now on a hunt to find this model for a good price so if anyone beats me to it, please share and post a reply :). NO more cracked liners or Kitchen Aid appliances for me. My toaster that I got in April- dead as a doornail. Kitchen Aid is no longer synomous with quality in my opinion.
A1E079MVIIMWOK	1	1	The gameplay is very intriguing and the control of the Spectrobes in battle is very intuitive and interactive. The storyline is very immersive and unique. The entire game concept is just great and I would recommend this to anyone who loves a fun game.
A1E079MVIIMWOK	1	1	I have been using the ceramic edge blades for about 4 years now and I love them. They simply outperform steel blades everytime. I have two standard poodles to groom at home and I have yet to sharpen any ceramic blades and they do run cooler (though any blade can get hot). If you follow Andis' directions with these blades then I don't see how you could go wrong.
A1E0MUYZPE8T4P	1	1	This deck is a great Medieval art.I would change only one card:"The whell of fortune".This card is not easy to understand because is very different if we compare with the tradicionals decks.
A1E0MUYZPE8T4P	0	1	I bought the premier edition of this deck 4 years ago...it was excelent..now they changed the print..the paper is very thin..i am very disapointed..i don't recomend this deck to people that like to use your decks too much.
A1E0MUYZPE8T4P	1	1	Excellent art and print..one of my favorite decks..my only criticism is the small size(5,5 x 110)..I prefer the tradicional size of most standard decks of Usgames and Systems:-70 X 120..I'm sure the deck would be even nicer if it were a little bigger..So,I take a star because of this detail.-****-4 STARS.
A1E0OFKTCBYV53	1	1	strange to write warnings about a book so beloved. but the warning is part of why the book is so great. it has taken me years (and will take me many more) to embrace, integrate, let alone, apply all the information machaelle small wright provides in each of her books. 1st: i didn't get it at all; 6 months later i got it, and bought the first two garden workbooks (to apply to running my small business.) 6 months after that i bought every other book by her and tried to read them all at once. NO.i got totally overwhelmed i had to forget about her entirely for another 6 months. now i'm back, to discover more, apply it as i may, and continue integrating and applying SLOWLY. my take on her work is that it is incredibly profound...i imagined i could easily and quickly digest it like some fast food new age feast. but that is not the case. so my warning is simply to go slowly. relish every word and every unfolding realization. if you wish it to, this is a journey that may continue to for as long as you wish it to, her work opens a gateway, to personal and global revelation. the most important revelation being (maybe) that personal and planetary revelation can not happen one, without the other. she is to my mind the sagest intuitive heart/mind writing/working in america today. dive in, then slow down.
A1E0OFKTCBYV53	0	0	imho the intense focus on physical sensations, excluding observation of feeling states, thought, externals, makes this method unbalanced. creates freak-outs in many who attend the 10day 'course.' the stated goal of equanimity seems not actual goal. didn't need my body to 'disappear.' technique seems mired in cultivating bliss-states (as opposed to clarity) while claiming contrary. confusing and confused. looked great on the surface. beneath surface theory and methodology revealed is rigid, doctrinaire--counter to it's own claims and counter to true dharma. cultish. keep looking. I also want to add, (November 18, 2010) that a lot of the glowing reviews here are written by the 'true believers' and repeat retreat attendees and supporters. That's fine. Just read between the lines and decide for your self.
A1E0OFKTCBYV53	1	1	For me, this book has been a powerful 'this is what i've been looking for' experience. I'm a fan of Martin Amis, Haruki Murakami, David Mitchell. I wish more 'literary fiction' dared to be more weird, so I go to fantasy, sci/fi and bemoan that, well.....I don't think they're well-written. After years of this frustration and basically giving up, I decided to try China Mieville again. I tried this book years ago, maybe soon after it came out. All the cool kids were raving about it. I definitely didn't get it. Jump to now and what a revelation this book is to me.Ditto all the glowing reviews here, wonderment at that amazing, unending imagination, characters I believe and believe in, words and sentences that make me glad I'm a creature with language and not an ox. As I read I considered the negative reviews I read here--readers who seemed overwhelmed by what they (seemed to me) to perceive as an unbearably bleak, barren, grotesque or even nihilistic vision/book. This is probably something like my reaction years ago. I find this world beautiful now. I find Mieville to be an idealist finding beauty in the worst places, in horrible acts, disturbing creatures and human failure. What is more beautiful than that? And oh yeah, it reminds me a lot of this world right here. This book made me cry and made me laugh. This book is moral. This book broke my heart and restored my faith that writing can do that. this book took my imagination further than any book ever has and to my mind never stopped talking about the most basic, simple, important human things, hope, love, betrayal, freedom, suffering, redemption. This is the only China Mieville I have read so excuse me for ranting like a madman, or like I remotely understand what he is up to, I don't. I'm totally intrigued though and on to read all the others.
A1E0OFKTCBYV53	1	1	fun and grisly and good ideas ans sense of history and magic. Dion Fortune and interesting ideas about light and otherwise.
A1E0ZGGZE4G1PI	1	1	Great musical toy! Perfect size for little hands to grasp and shake, they can really take a beating.
A1E0ZGGZE4G1PI	1	0	I buy a lot of gifts and this was one of them. It is not as nice as the previous brand by another company but she still likes it. It has a plug hole it seems to plug something into it, what I don't know but we find that weird. It also doesn't have a removable cover so you can wash it either. There wasn't a need to return it but wouldn't give it 5 stars. It's ok though for the price.
A1E0ZGGZE4G1PI	1	1	Bought as a stocking stuffer. It came in a red box and was as described. He works outside in the elements so it seems like it is going to be good. For the price you can't beat it!!
A1E0ZGGZE4G1PI	0	0	Sorry for the language folks, but it is really crappy!! I bought this against my better judgement because some of the reviews said that they first got defective ones. Let me start off by saying that I usually give things the benefit of the doubt but this is just terrible. I bought this thing anyway, hoping that I wouldn't have any problems. The big seller was that it was whisper quite...yes so quite that I didn't even realize that it wasn't working for two days!!! I took it all apart several times and still it would make a clicking noise and not rotate. I have had another name brand electric litter box and never had any problems with it. I had it several years and then it broke. The reason I didn't buy that one again was that it was noisy so I was happy to see that there was one that was not noisy. The other thing is that it doesn't have a cover for it. I did find one that would barely fit it. I have two children and I don't need to worry about them getting in the cat box because it is left open and it only rotates once an hour so who wants to sit and look at it that long. AGAIN, I was sold on this product solely for the fact that it did not make any noise, otherwise I would have gladly gotten the other one. When I contacted customer service after having to wait for days...granted it was the thanksgiving holiday so I didn't hold that against them, they tell me that I have to mail back the litter box to get a new one. So yes, I know have to mail back this HUGE litter box CRAP and all!! They are sending a replacement so I pray that one works, we shall see!!Pro: QuiteCons: Mailed a defective one~had to mail back a dirty box to get replacement, only rotates once an hour v.s others that clean it 10 mins after cat leaves, not a lot of room for cat to move around, no cover for it.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	1	1	The Clippers are very sharp and my dog has black nails. I accidently clipped too close the last time I was doing his nail. I felt awful about it, but it wasn't the clippers fault they are exellent and do their job quickly and easily.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	1	1	One of Sarah's early album, this has all beautiful songs. She has that voice that resonates with me every time. Great purchase.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	1	1	I found this Miniseries very thoughtful, incise, and beautifully written. I know they took some liberties with the truth, but what historical drama doesn't?I loved the crotchedly Adams who felt that politics were awful unless he was agreed with. I loved the relationship between Adams and his wife, who in an era were women were not often educated and were never expected to have an opinion, is a pistol and a person of very strong views and she was not afraid to disagree with her husband.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	1	0	I was taken with this story from the beginning. It was very well written with a lot of tense moments, like a thriller without so much bloodshed and nastiness.Like others I started getting disappointed with all the preachy lines and cartoonish coverting, However, I soon noticed that there was no fire and brimstone (that came all from the bad guys) and that it was actually following the teachings of Jesus. I liked the no old testament style and the easy way that relationships with the Lord were promoted. (I'm agnostic/wiccan, but I heavily believe in what the bible shows about Jesus' actions and beliefs). Many "true Christians" don't hold with the actual teachings of the man they call their savior - they like to go back for that eye for an eye old testament treatment (See Texas which claims a high percentage of Christians, but executes more people than Most countries do).There is also the lack today of True Christian charity, especially by those who espouse the "if they are in bad shape, poor, homeless, Ill, etc. then it's their fault and we shouldn't encourage them" philosophy that I see practised most visably in our Political arena by people with lots of money. I also liked that the celebration of the lead character's 'Come to Jesus moment' resulted in him getting caught - which it should have with him being hunted by bad guys and him jumping, hollering, whooping around even when he knew they were right on his tail. Seek forgiveness and you shall find it. Brag about it too much and be humbled.All in all, I could have done without so many references to the Lord, but the story was good enough to keep me going through that. It is very well written indeed for me to be able to read and enjoy it even with the Preaching.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	0	0	I have not noticed any difference in my dog since I started giving him this product. I do understand that different calming products don't work for every pet, it's a matter of trial and error. This was an error for my dog and I'll be trying again with a different product this month.
A1E18EMC2ZR4NQ	1	0	My dog loves these! He has learned the word 'greenie'! It's good for him but he treats it like a favored treat. I only use one a day, but he has accepted that and loves them. They are good for his teeth - he has better teeth than I do!
A1E1A2RYTRN4NV	1	1	Any fan of logic puzzles (especially Sudoku) will love this game! Challenging and addictive! Includes tutorials to help get you started.
A1E1A2RYTRN4NV	1	0	My shower drain was really blocked up, and I can't use liquid drain cleaners because they're bad for my septic system, so I picked up this product. The head of the snake is kind of big, so it was difficult to work the snake into the drain. Once I got it to the clog, though, the snake worked great. The hairballs were yanked out and now the drain flows freely again.
A1E1A2RYTRN4NV	1	1	This stripper is nothing fancy but it does its job well. I used this on 14-gauge speaker wire when I was setting up my new surround sound system, and it worked great!
A1E1AOKD6Q1DPJ	0	0	I had one question after finishing this book: Why?I picked up Roy's first novel after hearing and seeing it lauded everywhere as the most recent "Must Read". Well, I was unimpressed.First of all, I found Roy's writing style to be very choppy and unenjoyable. It is written in the tone and speech patterns, I think, of an 8-year-old child, probably the main character when she was younger. This was not charming or endearing; it was annoying and choppy. Instead of getting a mature observation, opinion, or commentary on social values/life, I was left to anticipate with dread the random repetitions, and Capitalized Insignificant Non-comments (such as "An Ammu Shaped Hole in the Universe") that Roy uses throughout her book. Surely such a life altering event is worthy of a more profound, or even just more thoughtful, observation.Secondly, I found the story to be enormously depressing. Not only does one event destroy their childhood, but we find in the last few chapters that their adult lives, their family, and their hometown has suffered also.And most of all, I found the use of profanity by the voice of an 8-year-old narrator to be extremely disturbing. In the same breath as "An Ammu Shaped Hole..." this child is using some really bad language. I read classics to escape everyday life, not return to it. Had Roy not stooped to using this language, I might have been more forgiving of the other flaws in her book.I did not particularly enjoy this read and I probably won't recommend it to anyone. That said, this is Roy's first novel, and I do still have hope for more enjoyable novels in the future from her.
A1E1AOKD6Q1DPJ	0	0	I picked this up after a week spent reading Roy's "The God of Small Things" in the hopes that it would be as good as The Poisonwood Bible. My patience with bad writing and bad plot development has completely run out.Hence it's no surprise that I gave up reading Kingsolver's novel after only 2 chapters that were totally devoid of ANY development. I felt like I was dropped smack in the middle of Deanna's world, and left to find my way through the reasons of her multiple bad decisions (why did she get a divorce and WHAT posessed her to be so welcoming so quickly to Ed, and why did she live on a mountain), and retain a little sympathy for what was surely going to be a tough road for her (because of her bad decisions).I also didn't appreciate the know-it-all tone Deanne had. Like she ruled the world on all things natural. Eww. Also really didn't approve of her condescention to anyone that didn't agree with her or see things her way.It's going back to the library tonight, thank goodness. And next, I'm reading a true master of Classic literature: Thomas Hardy. A return to reason and good reading.
A1E1DSNZ9DOBAI	1	1	I don't know what it is about this album, but I've listened to it about 10 times in the last week alone
A1E1DSNZ9DOBAI	1	1	This is a very nice, quality wok that is very reasonably priced. It comes with some cooking utensils and a cool cookbook. I highly recommend this wok!
A1E1DSNZ9DOBAI	1	0	Works well with my ipod nano 4th gen...just turn down the volume to about 1/2 or it will sound really bad over your car stereo. The sound is OK, but a bit flat.
A1E1EA2Y8GPKHD	1	1	Robert Downey Jr. shows, in his brilliant portrayal of Charlie Chaplin, why he is without peer among his contemporaries and a national treasure. This performance puts him up there with the Al Pacinos and Gene Hackmans of the world who have the ability to astonish with their brilliance! Nuff said! - Henry Gross
A1E1EA2Y8GPKHD	0	1	I bought this set and was really let down when the mono version of "Rubber Soul" was obviously a fold down from stereo! I understand there's a newer issue with the correct original mono. I can't find one. Apparently Capitol is still selling or has not sold out the original flawed pressing. Can someone post the serial # of the second issue box set on this site please! Is there a way to get one?I personally wish they would delete the 1987 CD re mixes done by George Martin which, to me, are the equivalent of colorizing movies! The remixes are typical 80's mixes with too much drums, digital effects etc. Listening to these mixes, all the magical guitar sounds are thin and metallic. I doubt this music would've achieved the acclaim it did if released in this form. This same misguided formula has ruined the Rolling Stones re issues on CD. Honky Tonk women is unlistenable! Will Capitol, my former label, ever figure out there's a reason people pay huge dollars for the original British LP's? I wish someone up there would realize there's a large audience for the mixes as they originally were released! With the number one CD selling only 66,000 copies this week, (Dreamgirls), you'd think sales of a couple hundred CD's would make it worth their while.The record business is in trouble in large part because of the slip shod, no one'll know the difference, attitude taken by the bean counters running the business. After a while people give up and move on! The Beatles catalog has got to be an important part of Capitols' income. Why not satisfy fans who want clean, undistorted by volume mashing, versions of the Beatles catalog as it was originally issued in the UK and the US in Mono and Stereo. I, for one, would buy a half dozen sets of each for family and friends!Millions of people made the Beatles the biggest musical act of the 20th century. Then someone gets a brilliant idea...let's remix their records without them and sacrifice the spontaneity and wit of the original band effort for the sake of removing the demonic tape hiss!!!! and never release clean CD versions of the original mixes again...ever! To whom does this make sense? It gives you a small clue as to why the record business is out of touch with its audience! If some people want remixes and mash ups fine, let em have em! But to keep the original article unavailable? At least with the Hendrix catalog both versions are available. The great Eddie Kramer's remixes are interesting but he's smart enough to respect the brilliance of his original mixes and they are kept available!It wasn't broken. Why must they "Fix it?" -Henry Gross
A1E1EA2Y8GPKHD	1	1	I've loved Joe E Brown's films since I was a child. These days I enjoy them as much as ever. I feel he is a great and unique comic who's work is mostly overlooked today. I wish all of his great films were restored and made available on DVD. The few that are available serve as a good start. Let's hope more are on the way!Henry Gross
A1E1EA2Y8GPKHD	1	1	The Blue Zone will get you hooked instantly & keep you Rockin' & Rolling till the very end. Andy Gross proves that all by his lonesome he can keep you on the edge of your seat. I'll be reading this one again for sure! Clever and suspensefull with countless twists & turns. Would make a great film!Henry Gross (No relation to Andy)
A1E1HKPICYVK4V	1	1	This book is excellent in look, feel, and quality. It is intriguing to see how much landscape has changed in 130 years. Many times for the better and many times for the worse. In every case it is very interesting to see two pictures side by side and compare 1870 with 2000. The photographer was very meticulous to capture every shot as closely as possible to the original perspective and frame, which really enhances the "then and now" feel of the book.
A1E1HKPICYVK4V	0	1	I am sorry to say that I must agree with those that are negative on this game...at least at this early hour on release day for the Xbox 360. I will reserve final judgement after many more hours of gameplay. However after my first hour or two I have many of the same impressions others have had. I went in with an open mind, but have come away feeling like I have bought a stinker. For one thing, and I'm sure this will be overemphasized by so many in the coming days and weeks, the voice acting is attrocious. I have not heard this poor of dialogue and voice acting in a game in many years. Granted, I am only a casual gamer, so I don't have an immense library to compare to, but I have played many RPG's and this is definitely a step back in the voice acting side of things. The graphics overall are nice, but the game play can feel choppy. I have extensively played Oblivion and compared to it, this is miserable. Finally, I was REALLY hoping this would become the answer for, or at the very least a very good try at, a really good multiplayer RPG on the Xbox 360. Based on the limited time I played online, it was a very very poor example of one in any way. Finally, the quest system is also horrid. I am actually sorry I bought this much anticipated game. In the meantime, I will give it more time and maybe I will finally come to see what the developers had in mind when they created this game. (This will date me, but...Right now I am feeling like I just got home with the Atari 2600 version of PacMan.) Too bad, I was hoping for so much more out of this game.
A1E1HKPICYVK4V	0	0	First of all this is my favorite movie trilogy of all time. However, I am very disappointed that this is FINALLY released on blu-ray only to have the EXTENDED versions left out! How infuriating. I will pass up this copy and watch the extended version DVD's. IF the EXTENDED version are released on blu-ray, I will be one of the first in line.
A1E24AWMHXSD8X	1	1	Good film but not up to date as much as some newer films. Warren Miller always had the touch that made films interesting.
A1E24AWMHXSD8X	1	1	this is a renowned auther that has researched the Bible extentively and helps the reader fully understand its content. It will help anyone understand the scriptures.
A1E27SNCAEHMOH	1	1	Once again, the Shins have put out another fantastic album. While Chutes Too Narrow (their last album before this) took a more stripped-down approach to songwriting and producing, Wincing the Night Away has more in common with Oh, Inverted World, their first album, as far as instrumentation goes. Gone are the simple sonorities are Chutes Too Narrow, and back again are the lush, full sounds of songs like Caring is Creepy, from Oh, Inverted World. This album is, however, different from that one in that they stretch their sound and try more experimental things. Sometimes, this is very overt, such as on the hip-hop inspired Sea Legs. But even on the songs that sound like classic Shins (such as Turn On Me), there is a fuller, more spacious sound.The lyrics on this album are far more ambitious than anything on either of the Shins' other two albums. Gone are the simple, unaffected love songs of Chutes Too Narrow (for example, "You want to fight for this love,/But honey, you cannot wrestle a dove"). They are replaced by more complex love songs, and more philosophical songs about human nature that we caught a glimpse of on So Says I. Some of Mercer's simple verses on the nature of humanity can be overwhelmingly beautiful. On "A Comet Appears" (the obligatory soft track at the end of the album, and perhaps this disc's best song), Mercer muses "Every post that you can hitch your faith on is a pie in the sky, chock full of lies, a tool we devised to make sinking stones fly." On Sleeping Lessons, the opening track, Mercer preaches "And if the old guard still offends, they've got nothing left on which we depend, so enlist every ounce of your bright blood and off with their heads." While the lyrics on this album still retain the awkward charm and absolute beauty of those on previous albums, Mercer has moved on to much more heavy subject matter and, for the most part, succeeded.This album is absolutely up to par with previous Shins albums, and while it may not have quite the charm or beauty in simplicity which Chutes Too Narrow posess in spades, it makes up for it with an evolving sound and more mature lyrics. Hopefully, this album will be a good stepping stone to another great, and even more different, album, but on it's own, it is very, very good. Sleeping lessons, Phantom Limb, and A Comet appears are absolutely some of the best Shins tracks yet. Highly recommended to anyone who loved their first two albums (they are changing in a good way!), and also to those who didn't like their first two (it is more mature, less cutesy, and more overblown, which I can't see as being a good thing, but if you can't appreciate the beautiful understatedness of Chutes Too Narrow, I guess that's the only thing I can say that will make you give them a shot).
A1E27SNCAEHMOH	1	1	As a cellist who has listened to a large number of different cellists and recordings, I can honestly say that I think this is some of the best cello playing ever recorded. The second sonata and the Papillon are particularly beautiful, but the entire disk is just stunning. I could go on forever about his spectacularly fluid left hand technique and vibrato, his seemingly endless range of articulations, and his glowing, sparkling sound, but I'll just leave it at this: if you like cello music, you should get a hold of this CD (as well as his recording of Bridge and Britten sonatas). Barry Snider's accompanying is also stunning.
A1E2EEPR8TG561	1	1	This is an excellent movie. A few kissing scenes that will leave you absolutely breathless, and one of the funniest moments in the film is Elvis' drunken scene. He is just so silly in it, you can see his co-stars genuinely laughing at his antics! A must see for any Elvis fan! Also, a few very moving scenes in the movie, including the scene where Glenn (Elvis) was talking to Mrs. Sperry (Hope Lange) about the death of his Mother. You can see the intensity of this moment, as if Elvis were speaking of the death of his real Mother, Gladys. Elvis was a great actor as well as his beautiful singing voice. A very complex person with many facets. This film shows many facets of his character.
A1E2JTFB4WFQMT	0	1	This grooved plastic spoon is no better than a tweezer at removing firmly attached ticks. Unless the critter is completely fat and bloated by blood and nearly ready to drop off on its own, you will leave the head in the wound just like you will with tweezers. We've tried and tried to make it work, but it's really hard to get a tick's head out when it's firmly buried in a cat's fur. It might work better on dogs, but I haven't tried that since I don't have dogs.I'll keep looking and I'll expect to pay more for the right tool. Sadly, this little plastic spoon isn't the right tool.** Edit: we used the product quite a number of times now and my impression of it is no better. Again it's my patient wife who has the better luck using it. The method we employ is that I hold the squirming, snarling, hissing cat as she presses the tool firmly into the skin in an effort to get under the tick and tease it out of the cat's skin. The cats hate it, I hate it, my wife doesn't really enjoy it, and more often then not, the head is left deeply buried in the cat's skin. With all our experience I'd still say this tool is about an 80% failure.However! We recently bought a Trix Ticklasoo. What a difference! It's a tool with a little noose on the end you engage syringe style. You gently slip it around the body of the offending insect, slowly allow it to tighten around the neck, and the tick backs out. The process does not hurt the cat (no hissing, growling or struggling) and so far, we're 100% at getting the ticks out head and all. We still haven't tried it on a tick that's deeply buried in the cat's skin so I haven't reviewed it yet, but at this point it looks like I'll give it five stars. I may offer an update here as well once we have a bit more experience. It's a well engineered product and a far cry better than the little notched plastic spoons.
A1E2JTFB4WFQMT	1	1	This is an excellent handyman's tool. The only issue is that it's a bit heavy, but any fiberglass eight foot ladder will be. It works great on solid level surfaces, of course, and is much more rigid than most stepladders. The real benefit comes up when used, (probably against recommendations) on a steep slope. You can have the support leg at a different height than the step side. If you're painting a house on a hillside or working under a deck you'll appreciate that ability.I've also used mine orchard ladder style while working on my apple trees. It's nearly as stable as a three legged orchard ladder and if used carefully is perfectly safe for that application. Once again, the manufacturer probably wouldn't recommend that but it's worked fine for me.One very minor complaint is the locking mechanism that prevents the ladder from folding up on you while in use. There is a large button on either side of the top (not a step-heh heh). If the legs are fully extended you can't reach the buttons to fold up the ladder for moving it. You have to close up the legs first so you can manage the buttons. On the plus side, this system absolutely prevents the ladder from accidentally closing up on you when you are up in the air.This is positively the safest ladder I've used.
A1E2JTFB4WFQMT	1	1	I bought this DVD for the segment called Ecstasy Rising and it's certainly worth owning just for that. The other five are also worth watching and sharing with your children and friends. It's hard to beat Peter Jennings at presenting useful information in an easy to grasp manner. He is sorely missed and this collection is a fine tribute to his work.
A1E2JTFB4WFQMT	1	0	The bottom line is, this is a fine quality product that (mostly) stays where you put it, "refreshes" with a bit of water or saliva, and if you get a little in your mouth, it doesn't taste bad. In fact, it has practically no taste at all. It also has a great shelf life (in my experience) so buying the large size makes sense. The item shipped immediately.
A1E2JTFB4WFQMT	1	1	I almost never use an electric beater so I'm always reaching for a whisk when something needs mixing. I've bent and broken quite a number of wire whisks over the years. The cheap ones come apart from the handle, have too small of a handle for a comfortable grip, and then there's that cleanup issue of the crossover wires and the handle that never gets completely clean inside. The cheap ones sometimes rust as well. Enter the Zyliss Quick Blend. The full sized yet lightweight handle is comfortable in the hand and reduces fatigue. Although the handle is larger than that of an all wire whisk, it's light enough to prevent the tool from falling over backwards out of the bowl you're working in. The wires are permanently bonded to the handle in what appears to be a completely sanitary method that prevents liquids from getting inside the handle. That's very nice! The cleanup is easier due to the innovative wire design that eliminates crossover at the tip and the whisk just works well. A simple tool redesigned to be infinitely better. The next whisk I buy will also be a Zyliss, of that I'm certain.
A1E2K3RWSB9AJU	0	1	I know this is something of a "classic," but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, "What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?"Be forewarned!
A1E2K3RWSB9AJU	1	1	A really great movie. Note: If you are looking for an action film, this film isn't for you. It's a serious film and you have to be in the mood for that and expect that. That said, there is some drama, and the actress is simply fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the extended interrogation scenes.Nothing like a 21-year-old girl standing up to tyranny and risking her life for what is right simply because her conscience tells her she must. May her soul be blessed.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	This is a wonderfully moving, excellently crafted tale of family ties and the healing power of love. Written in the style of a personal journal, it takes us on a fascinating ride from beginning to end. Full of emotional highs and lows, this book is almost impossible to put down until the last page is turned. The talent of this author is astounding...She has also written several other books under the name 'Ruth Wind' and I recommend them all.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	This was still an enjoyable story and certainly worth the time.No, it's not about the SEALS but still showcases some interesting characters and tells a good tale. The conversations between Jax and his fictional character are a bit strange but once you get used to the idea, it's not so bad. This was a unique perspective and did give more insight into how the main character was feeling. I'd buy the book again...
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	Karen Robards delivers the 'can't put it down' type of story-line that makes me wish she could write a book like this every month. Classic plot line with several clever twists to keep the reader guessing and a real surprise ending. You'll never guess who the Beachcomber is. This is a can't miss choice.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	These are the best around. They are soft and chewy, not hard like other brands and are affordable and easy to find in stores.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	Zarafina Tea Maker Suite with Ceramic Tea Pots, Cups, and Serving Tray*** I thought about this a while before I made the purchase because of the price....but I am so happy to have this in the kitchen. The tea is brewed as you like it and there are many options available to customize the strength of the brew, the type of tea used, etc. It's quick and the clean up is easy. I love it.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	This was recommended to me by my long-time vet after my 5 year old Russian Blue boy developed chrystals in hir urine and was hospitalized. She also recommedned the canned food she has in her office but my ctas wouldn't eat it. I saw this stuff at Petco and gave it a try. Now, they share a can every day and no more trips to the vet. Phew!!!
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	*** I can't remember where I found this the first time - probably at a Marshall's but I was hooked from the start. The fragrance is enchanting and lasts a long time, especially if I use the lotion with the powder. I'm depending on Amazon to make sure I can continue to get this. I really don't think I can find it in a local store anymore. I just have to keep my husband out of my supply because he wants to wear this too. There's nothing like this delicious fragrance at this price. Try it !
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	0	1	I read about this in a magazine where the reviewer raved and raved. I figured, why not and ordered it even tho it was pricey. It's cute, you bet, but just try cleaning it after the first use. What do you mean it won't come clean?? Try soap?? Still nothing?? You can still see and feel the make up ??So, now I have this cute, used to be pink, thingy on my counter. Can't get it clean no matter how I try. My advice would be to stick to your old foam wedges that can be cleaned.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	**** Oh, boy were we relieved. We had an old key pad that had given out and we are so not mechanically inclined. The thought of any do-it-yourself projects causes some distress. But, after reading a few reviews on this product, we ordered it hoping that we would be able to actually make a home repair without causing more trouble. And, yay, we took the replacement out to the garage, removed the old key pad and replaced it with this new one which worked right away with the same old code. Whew. No more worry about how much this repair was going to cost. Thanks to a well written prior review we were successful with this repair and things are back to normal.
A1E2RKXJQPW0K5	1	1	We are in the middle of updating all the handles in the house and this is just the right thing.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	This is an italian band that sings in italian. Don't panic, you dont need to know a word of italian to enjoy it. This group has been around for a long time and they are successful songwriters for other artists as well. Technically, their music would be soft &quot;rock&quot;, but actually its much nicer than that. The lead vocalist has a beautiful smoothed-out rough voice! The rock instrumentation is complemented with luscious strings. Most importantly, awsome melodic songwriting! Celin Dion, look here for your next cover version, girl!
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Ricardo Montaner, from Venezuela, has been releasing records since the early 80s. Already a superstar in the latino world, he was a total stranger to me when I arrived from Spain (where in the 80s, South American artists were ignored and never played on radio) to the U.S in 1992. I hated listening to latino radio in the U.S., because it was full of corny ballads and psychologicaly, in Spain we were tought that it couldnt be good music. But then one fine day, stuck in PCH traffic my tape player broke and I had to turn the radio on, and there comes Ricardo Montaner with "Castillo Azul (Blue Castle)". The road was curvy, so I couldnt reach for the radio to change channels, so I had to listen to the whole thing. By the time the song was over, I was a Ricardo Montaner fan!!! I've been buying every CD he puts out! This guy has one of the most beautiful male voices anywhere. Hello?? I said anywhere!! Its a clean sharp voice. The only thing similar to his voice that I've seen is Italy's Albano. He is a balladier, and he makes me cry. The songs are so touching. In this album "Prohibido Olvidar" he goes for the "bolero-ballad" style helped by 70s disco artist "Bebu Silvetti" who used to work with Tom Moulton. You have luscious string sections and theres no italian cover versions this time. Its all original. Ricardito!!, your records are so touching that I'm in loves with you!!
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	I first heard the song &quot;Youm Wara Youm (habibi)&quot; (Day after Day) in a night club in Madrid Spain. It took me 3 days of intense asking and searching to find out who the performing artist was. The song has a mid-tempo R&amp;B rythm track and then the dueto arabic vocals are gorgeous. I dont speak a word of arabic and I loved the song. The chorus is infectious.The better surprise was, that when I came back to the U.S., I was able to buy the CD domestic release for less than $10 dollars. Great job from Mondo Melodia for releasing this. It would be great if MTV and radio started playing it too.We shouldnt ignore great music just because its in a different language.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Moenia is one of the best synthesizer based bands around. I'm not only talking about the spanish language market, but any market. For example, this CD contains &quot;En que Momento (At what point)&quot; which to me is the &quot;best&quot; song of 2003. And I'm talking worldwide here! Sound wise its not fluffy synthesizers.They use harder sounds and acoustic instrumenation and even guitars, when the moment calls for it. You will like them probably more than OBK or Fangoria or Depeche Mode or Red Flag.They are above all great songwriters. This CD for example contains &quot;No es Lo Mismo (Its not the same thing)&quot; which apart from a gorgeous vocal melody, contains very interesting lyrics describing what goes on in many contemporary relationships.In other words their lyrics are in touch with today. The arangements are very clever too.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	0	0	I bought this item because you dont have to connect it to a network for it to work. You just store your pictures in a compact flash card. I did like it, however I must say that it would show some pictures too many times, and others would never be shown. It sounds like a small problem, but it gets very annoying. Eventually the item broke during a trip to Europe, when I tried a store bought DC adapter that didnt have the Amps needed. I know it might have been my fault, but given it being such an expensive item, I felt that it was made kind of cheaply to break just because it was pluged two seconds with the wrong Amps!
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	There was full blown and free expresion pop music in Iran before the political events of 1978. Since in the early part of the 1970s, there was only one radio station, and the main programming manager was a highly sofisticated traditional musician and songwriter, it was very dificult to get radio airplay and consequently dificult releases had to be few and sophisticated. This situation favored more an orchestrated POP sound and so, unlike western countries, there was not much guitar focused ROCK. The only exception was Yaghmaee, which had to incorporate a sophisticated and nicely produced production in order to get airplay. As with Turkey's Erkin Koray, Yaghmaee incorporates into his rock style, local folk elements, but played on his electric guitar. The hammond organ playing is just amazing! So this is highly recommendable. The only low point on this compilation, is that it was poorly released on CD by Caltex Records in Los Angeles, without an informative booklet and without any information. Not to mention that the tracklist is incorrect.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Aref was the most famous Iranian male POP singer from before the time of the ayatollahs. The music in this collection is modern beat oriented POP with great and grandeous string sections and orchestration. Luxurious recordings from the 1970s.The songs are sprinkled with touches of iranian instrumentation and traditions, but in general are great western style pop beat music. Absolutely recommended. The other reason I recommend this CD is that unlike many of the iranian CD re-edition of old material, it seams that this Aref CD was made from the masters and sounds great, allowing you to appreciate the luxurious original recording. Wish the album had a nice booklet, which it doesnt. I also wish they would release the resto of his 70s material on CD.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Emad Ram (other spellings include Emade or Emad Raam) was a musitian from northern Iran. He created an Orchestra (sort of like Perez Prado) and they became sort of an in house band for the public television. He was also a vocalist and a songwriter. This CD, however, only focuses on his talen as Flute instrumentalist. And that is quite a talent. Iranian folk and western pop are mixed here with the haunting flute playing.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Simin Ghanem has an amazing operatic voice. In fact, she studied to be an Opera singer. In the Iran of the late 60s as a side project, she started doing vocal sessions for radio leading to her massive first hit "Golak e Cheshaat" with music written by the movie score writer Lacini. The sparsely spaced tune left lot of space for simin's grandeous voice to reach its maximum glory. Other great songs continued including the absolute classic: "Laneye Moor (rat hole" which popularly is better known for its opening line: Gol e Goldoon. The only problem with this compilation is that it doesnt seam to have been made from the original masters, and therefore we are unable to enjoy the recordings in their absolute glory. Also the record company releasing this CD has not included a booklet with information about the recordings or the artist.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	0	This was Viguen's last production before his passing away in October 2003.The song "Baazgasht (return)" is a luxurious production that has real acoustic drums and guitars. It has been nicely engineered and sounds fantastic. His voice fits perfectly, the melancholic song. The lyrics are perfect for being one of his last recordings, since they give a nice retrospective on the significance of this goodlooking male singer for pop music in Iran.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	0	Female dance pop singer from the 1970s from inside Iran. Among her achievments, included on this LP, is one of the first "Banadari" style tracks released by a major artist. She also sings a cover of the turkish song Azizam. Also gives a try at iranian disco with "Aashegh shodam Aashegh".Its a pitty that the record company has released this complilation with such a lame jacket design and little or no production or songwriter inforamtion.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Sousan (Soosan) was an iranian female singer that practiced an urban iranian folk music known as: " Koocheh baazari ", meaning: Music from the streets of the Baazar!.From a musical composition point of view, this music is very simple. Actually sometime overlly simplistic, simply following the notes of the musical scale. However, the lyrics talk about problems of ordinary urban people that many other artists dont cover. Also the vocal "soul-ish" pipes of performers like Sousan is simply breath taking and overshadows the simple musical compositions.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Unlike many iranian cd's covering the pop music of the 1970s, this multi artist compilation is made from the master tapes, and simply sounds fantastic.Totally recommended.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	This smiling and good looking guy, who recently passed away, used to combine the popular bluesy music of downtown Tehran bazar's with Bandari music of his region close to the Persian Gulf. Interesting.CD inlcludes songs from the Fanoos e Aabi movie including the songs: Khastegar and navalaa.Unlike the record companies un informed claims, this CD was not made from masters and has not been remastered. The president of Caltex records, who has issued this CD, doesnt even know what Remastered means!
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	It was very frustrating when this CD came out, and radio sations in the US didnt play it. Big name magazines didnt review it either. Simply because it was Boy George. The record companies first mistake was trying to promote the CD with the song "Fun Time" becuase its a cover version co-written by Bowie and so it could give them something to write on the promo sheet they would send to programmers. However, the original compositions of this CD are much more original, clever and relevant to our times. With this CD, Boy George showed us that he is unlike artists with fake lives and music, such as Guns and Roses, George Micheal or Kate Bush. Boy George took his weaknesses, his errors, the low points of his life, the horrors and the smallest details and turned them into these powerful songs that totally rock, both in their musical composition as well as their lyrics. Talks about feeling ugly, seeing friends die, drugs, being gay, crooks, poverty... and all in all keeps things uplifting and hopeful! The production is powerfull, sounds great and makes no compromises! I still remember the feeling of playing "Sad Sad Sad" in my car at maximum volume with the windows open, driving thru LA!! It rocked!! Shame on the radio stations that ignored this album. [...]
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Unlike other iranian re-issues from the 1970's, this one seams to have been made from the master tapes and sounds great.Farzins late 1970s music is the closest iranian pop music got to disco music. Songs include:Pass chera man naragsam.Dam begirimBaaniSaareboonJadehaye Barfisharghizaminkhodahafezabr siahjonoobi.
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	0	Mahasty has a powerful innate voice. This is a collection of her 1970s material. The sound quality is great and seams to have been made from the masters. This is unlike other iranian CD releases that have poor quality. In this collection Mahasti bridges the gap between traditional classical vocal music of Iran and pop music. These arrangements and compositions make this sort of music accessible to those whose ear is only accostumed to pop music. The use of the traditional iranian percussion zarb and the iranian instrument santur are very interesting.Tracklist:1-Biganneh2-Magiresh Az Man3-Ghebleh Gaah4-Labkhand5-Tasof6-Kambood7-Dorangee8-Delam Tangeh9-Nazan Sang10-Cheragh11-Atreh Bahaar12-Shakheh Nabaat13-Ashegh Shodan Be Haseleh14-Del Megeh Delbar Meyad15-Man Degeh Yaar Nemekham
A1E36RZ4I0KJHU	1	1	Midnight Storm was an album recorded in Switzerland at the beggining around 2000 or 2001 and was supposed to be called "In My life" released as Mike Kennedy. Mike is the vocalist of Los Bravos. Mike Kogel Kennedy is a superstar that is familiar to those of us who like 1960s beat oriented rock. He had solo hits like " Louisiana " and soft rock hits like " Un payaso loco " in the early 70s. The material in "Midnight Storm" is not Beat music, its more of an R+B pop with drum programming. However, it is tastefully arranged and the lyrics are significant and important. The music is full of catchy hooks and its the best material that Mike has released in a long time. It is co-written by songwriter Olivia Gray. For comercial reasons it was released years later as Los Bravos and a new version of Black is Black is included in it.
A1E3D4AOTP04HF	1	1	I have never purchased a live album as they just don't trip my trigger. Be it the 15 minute guitar solo in the middle of my favorite song, or the completely different sound than the album version, they have always left me cold.Throw all of that out the window with Rush in Rio. This is an incredible CD and it flows with an energy unlike any other album I've ever heard. All it will take to prompt you to purchase this is the track "Driven". I heard this track on Pandora (and of course on Test For Echo) and was hooked.The only drawback is the lack of "Subdivisions", but that's a personal preference.Reward yourself, and your CD collection, and pick up Rush in Rio---you won't be disappointed!
A1E3D4AOTP04HF	1	1	This movie has been on my radar for years as I enjoyed it many, many times when I was younger. I finally got around to ordering it and was not disappointed as it is still just as funny as I remembered.Rodney Dangerfield is at his best here as is a young Joe Pesci. There are too many funny moments to mention and the movie is hilarious from beginning to end.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	It is Miyota Movement.Main reason for buying this.I would have liked the coin-edged bezel more but this is nice too.I also got a couple of 'Zulu'/'G10'/'Nato'/'Bond' watch-straps to go with it.I wear the straps interchangeably.Its original metal strap is very nice too but a little too formal for everyday wearing in my opinion.The watch keeps the time, no need to adjust so far.It has been more than a month since I received it.The crystal is resistant to scratching.No scratches so far, thank God.I wear it everyday, it sees rough use.A very elegant looking functional and reliable watch with an original Japanese Miyota Movement.Quality make and feel.So far I am very very happy with my purchase/watch.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	Does the job well. Comes with easy to understand instructions.Takes less than half an hour to do the job.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	This is the first Ludlum book I have read.Made me read almost all of hos books.From start to end, a page-turner.Better than watching a movie at a movie theater, this is a private screening, the book and you.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	Good enough for my purpose, I do not need big industrial size grills to impress people anyway.I used the grill 3-4 times since I bought it last month.Walmart price is 29.99 plus tax.I wish I bought it at amazon.I did not know this brand was so famous before buying this.I was about to get a made-in-China grill at half the price.Good that I have not.This works well, easy to operate, easy to clean, sturdy construction. Most important of all it is made in USA.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	A Dutch/Belgian coffee with great flavor. The blend is ground from Arabica and Robusta beans, not Arabica.Thank you Amazon for bringing one more international flavor to the US.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	0	It keeps time and it is cheaper.That is what I was looking for.But the plastic 'glass' is higher than the side of the watch so if you hit it accidentally it might get scratched or broken easily.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	0	This filter is made in Thailand by Denso alongside some Toyota OEM filters.Denso branded filter has silicone ADBV but Toyota OEM filter made by Denso does not.The price difference between the two may be explained by this factor.Original filter your car came with from factory is not this filter or Toyota OEM filter, the original filter (90915-10003) is made in Japan and is not available in the US anymore. Instead Toyota dealers install 90915-YZZF2 which Toyota's new and lower quality filter made in Thailand by Denso.Denso branded filter comes in color blue, not black as shown in Amazon's product photo.I added current photos.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	0	If you do not want to put a part that is made in China into the most delicate part of your car, its transmission, do not buy this.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	It is smaller than OEM filter, falls into the air cleaner box, does not stay there as it should. Not made for the car it says was made for.Uneven foam gasket construction. Cardboard-like cheap paper element. Made in Mexico.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	The metal parts on the front side of the filter were rusted, God knows how long had this filter been waiting in warehouses before it was shipped to me.I bought it thinking that the brand was respectable and the product should be of good quality. The paper element is a kind of thin cardboard, the foam gasket is uneven, the metal parts are rusting. It was not made in the USA.I had to return the filter, and order a Denso First Time Fit filter.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna. If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these, I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described. Even if they did what they are supposed to do, I did not realize that. It has not made a difference appearance-wise.Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer. Do I regret buying them? No. I do not.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	I bought these pads just because they were made in Japan. It turns out that Japan recently outsourced manufacturing of these pads to the US. The packaging says they are made in USA.I try to use made in USA products whenever possible, in order not to buy anything from China. But my car is a Japanese car and I want nothing but the Japanese parts on it. Japan-made is another way of saying the best quality available.I have these pads on Beck Arnley premium rotors (Made in Brazil) for a few days now. So far I am happy with the duo. I hope they will provide me with a long and satisfactory service.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	It is working flawlessly. Very easy to set up. It took a few minutes to make it work with Komturk (voipvoip), my provider. I got the device here on amazon because it was cheaper and also because it is not locked to a specific provider, in case I prefer a different one in the future. It comes with the power adapter. The way amazon bundles products, I thought I needed an adapter which usually comes with the product.I got a cheap cordless phone to complete my system, It is nice not having to pay ever-increasing phone charges.I do not think I will ever need all the features the device presents. It has been a few weeks since I started using this, so far I have used call-blocking, voice mail features.I get an email whenever someone calls me and I do not pick it up. Hopefully I will explore different features and make use of them.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	Thanks to the other review, I ordered these for my car.The rotors come in well-packaged 2 piece plastic tubs.I called Beck Arnley to find out where these specific rotors were made. I was told that they were made in Brazil.I did not order Brembo because my application was made in China. I try NOT to buy anything that is made in China. They do not value quality. Only thing they care about is the quantity.I hope these rotors do not rust, the previous rotors on my car were probably OE rotors and they did not have rust on the surface after so many years of use in WI winters.I also installed new Akebono ProAct ceramic pads with these rotors. Pads were made in the USA.I hope I will be satisfied with the long service life these rotors will hopefully provide me with.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	I ordered two of these filters. The packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box. However both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.I returned them for a refund.Metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent Toyota filters.Maybe a reason to use the bigger size.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	1	$14 a quart now for ATF? Amazon has to keep the price at $10.49 per bottle. Otherwise there is no point in buying it from amazon. Local auto-racing stores sell it for $10.49.As for performance I did 3 drain and refills on my car, I have not seen any difference in shifting. The fluid gets dark very fast (after driving a few miles), unlike some other ATFs.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	0	It works well, it looks nice. 18/10 polished stainless steel.Durable-looking mechanism.HOWEVER there is no way to say where this product was made in. It might very well be China. Company is German-based but that does not mean a thing in today's world. If the item were German-made, Germans would not be embarrassed to stamp it on the stainless steel. There is no stamp as to the country of origin. Neither is there a sign on the packaging to point to the country of origin.I just hope it is not radioactive. Like the radioactive stainless steel cheese grater (made in China) theyfound in a salvage yard a couple of years ago in Michigan. Cobalt 60 infused stainless steel out of a nuclear power plant before, cheese grater now.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	I got this in order to see scenes from old Istanbul, Turkey.Graeat acting, nice local folk music, wonderful scenery. I got what I hoped getting.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	0	0	All of the positive sides mentioned in other reviews, no need to repeat those.However this thing gets dented too easily. Since Thermos company is making lots of money by having this made in China (A DOLLAR A BOTTLE at most), they could at least make sure the Chinese used better quality (18/10), thicker stainless steel.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	0	I got the marine color bath towel. I expected it to be really thick but it is not as thick as some other reviews suggest here. Just thicker than cheap towels we see at walmarts.It gives you the feeling of a quality woven item. I had no problem drying it in the dryer like some apparently have had.But I am not going to try air-druing it on my Moerman dryer rack:Moerman Laundry Solutions Y-Airer Indoor Folding Clothes Drying Rack 79 Feet Of Drying SpaceI can not say anything for durability yet.It has been a month or so since I started using this towel. It is OK for now.I hope it lasts at least as twice longer as cheap walmart/China towels.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	I got these for my 1994 Geo Prizm back in 2009 and so far I am satisfied with them.They were made in Japan then, not sure where they are made in now.So these will fit 1993-1997 Geo Prizm and Toyota Corolla also.
A1E3RTMBHQ2RJE	1	1	The heater in the boy's room at the beginning of the movie does not belong to '70s for sure.ITT brand television is a nice touch.
A1E3WEJRJLWSSP	1	0	As with other reviews I've read, it does take some negotiating before you figure out how it slips on. And other arguments about collecting dust - well I'd rather have dust collecting than scratch and dings on my camera.Expensive? I guess if you think protecting your camera isn't worth the money then perhaps, it is. The lens piece is useless as other review suggests.
A1E3WEJRJLWSSP	0	0	My mistake was that I believed in Rick Steve's name.This money belt seems to be decently made. However, I found one major flaw in this product. The idea is to keep your money, credit card, passport and other items hidden and protected. Yes, it will hide it and keep it prtected. But not when you get soaked or when you sweat. This nice silk money belt lacks the moisture barrier. So, what you have in the money belt will get soaked by rain or your sweat. So, get yourself a ziploc bag and then use this item.There are other products are just as good or better than this product for much less money. You can get one locally at bed, bath & beyond.
A1E3WJOAA053LT	1	1	Late summer of 2005 I decided to turn our investments over to a financial advisor. My wife questioned whether it made sense to give such a huge cut (2% of market value each year) to a brokerage firm. That weekend we went to Barnes and Noble and I bought this book. The rest is history. I am in index funds and short term bonds. I am 60/40 domestic/foreign. My return has been great but the most important thing is that I sleep well at night. I rebalance when the numbers get out of whack not because of some hunch or fear. I sold everything that I owned to get into this strategy and paid a large amount of tax but it has all been worthwhile. This strategy forces you to take profits when stocks rise and buy stocks when prices go down. It makes sense and it works.
A1E3WJOAA053LT	1	1	Ignore the CD that comes with the device. I just plugged it in and Vista did the rest. Very easy and works well.
A1E3WJOAA053LT	0	1	This is a good thriller. I was reminded of The Day of the Jackal. Someone is on his way to explode a nuclear weapon in the US and the question is whether he will succeed. The book is well plotted. Sadly it is spoiled by some of the worst proof reading I have ever seen.This book contains a language error in virtually every sentence. The errors are so consistent that someone must have tried to conform to some odd grammar.1. Plurals. Most plurals are formed by adding apostrophe s to a noun. E.g. "There were three car's in the driveway."2. Possessives. Most possessives were formed by adding s to a noun. E.g. "He opened the Fords passenger door."3. Past Participles. The past tense was consistently used as the past participle. E.g. "have went,"have chose,""have broke," etc."4. Double negatives. Some of the best double negatives I have ever encountered are found here. "They denied they neither built nor flew the weapon."Maybe it is just me, but I found it distracting to read a book that had so many errors in language.
A1E4579LV2RKLE	0	1	Too academic and philosophic. I could not finish the book. If you want to know about Tito, read West's book.
A1E4579LV2RKLE	1	0	I was given this video as a gift. I would not put myself in the alternative medicine crowd, so I was at first a bit skeptical about the links to acupressure. However, this video is put together so well! It is not heavy on Chinese theory and very practical. I have now watched it at least 25 times. The first few times watching the video, I was just using the techniques and ignoring the theory references, later I became more curious and actually learned a fair bit.Amazon does not yeat have the other videos in the Holomedica series so I tried one from Amazon's most popular myMassageVideo. Big mistake! (Don't believe the reviews) The comparison of the two videos was like comparing a National Georgraphic special against a local cable access education program. Holomedica's video was that much better. I'll wait for the others next time.
A1E4579LV2RKLE	1	1	I am a sales and marketing professional who has studied this subject for some years. Cialdini has done a great job helping people identify when they are being manipulated and how to defend against it. First he shows studies that PROVE you are being manipulated even when you think you are enough smart to avoid it. Next he described the countermeasures, which almost always consists of understanding that this is a trick, so you need not respond the way you have been taught as good manners. This is the best book for the non-sales person in the world of unscrupulous business-driven zealots and con artists. If you want to know how to honorably sell in a positive way, I recommed The book on selling by Jolles.
A1E4579LV2RKLE	1	1	I used this to upgrade my ReadyNAS NV to 1GB. Worked fine. There is a youtube video that shows the installation-- 5 minutes and requires a simple screwdriver.
A1E47GK7SJYLY4	0	1	The whole idea of using the auger in the grinder to push meat into sausage casings is flawed - not only does the auger get warm and melt the fat, but you are almost RE-grinding the meat by using this. As a consequence, I made five pounds of breakfast sausage this morning and ended up with the casings stuffed with PASTE, not ground meat. In other words, I wanted breakfast SAUSAGE and ended up with something more like a breakfast HOT DOG. Blecch,Also, the hopper on the grinder only holds a small amount, so you're trying to guide the stuffed casing with one hand, push the meat into the auger (no, it doesn't gravity feed) with the other hand and keep adding meat to the hopper with the other hand - yes, that's THREE hands....and don't even get me started on the "pusher" for the grinder.Yes, a "real" stuffer is expensive, but the savings in frustration is well worth it.
A1E47GK7SJYLY4	1	1	Looking to expand my knowledge of physiology to improve my skills as a Personal Trainer, I purchased Dr. Muscolino's excellent book on Kinesiology. I liked it so well, I purchased this book, too.I found his writing style to be perfect for me. He starts very simply and gradually adds complexity, so that you learn without being overwhelmed. The formatting is consistent throughout the book so that you can easily find the information you're looking for when using it as a reference.No one mentioned the CD, but I found it very helpful as well.
A1E47GK7SJYLY4	1	1	I bought this on a whim a few years ago, and have been cooking from it - occasionally - ever since.I don't cook from it as often as I'd like because the recipes are very involved. Not complicated, or difficult, but involved. Very few of the recipes involve just ONE item. Most of them require you to cook one thing, in order to make another. Yeah, there are ways to shortcut the process, but the results aren't as good as doing it the "right" way. When you follow the recipes as written, the results are generally EXCELLENT. I think the only one I've made that I was disappointed with was the Mole chicken - but then, maybe I just don't like mole. (I'm not big on chocolate).The Wings O Fire are OUTSTANDING. I bring these to parties and get nothing but raves. (I simplified the process by having my sister mix up the Fuego Spice mix in bulk and I make a large batch of the Blazin BBQ sauce and water bath can it, so to make a batch of wings is easy).In short, a well written winner, but be aware that the recipes are involved and time consuming, but the results are WORTH it.
A1E47GK7SJYLY4	1	1	I am going to write to the author and ask for a commission, because I think I've sold five or six of these. Everyone who has borrowed it ends up buying their own. Having worked our way through many of these, we no longer really follow the recipes - each one has a whole bunch of handwritten notes next to it, now - but it's a great book for people to get started with.Yes, some of the recipes use "shortcuts", but they are great for starting out and then you can move on to some of the other, harder-to-make liquers. Once people see how easy they are to make, they want to do more.
A1E4PCMQI2JJ2A	1	0	My husband's shaver wasn't doing too good a job anymore. But after replacing the heads, he said it works very well now.
A1E4PCMQI2JJ2A	0	1	I am not that happy with these pans as they scratch very easily. I have bought many T-Fals in the past and was very happy with them. I guess there are different grades and quality. They do cook well but I don't like that they are scratched. If you get them be very careful with them.
A1E4PCMQI2JJ2A	1	1	bought them for my 3 1/2 yr old grand children for Christmas and they absolutely love them. Shipment arrived promptly. They are easy to inflate and deflate. My son takes them with them everywhere they go. The only drawback is if you are in the same room with the kids, the beds make noise if the kids toss and turn a lot.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	This is crackpot material.Assis's theory, which assumes that time is absolute, violates a vast number of high-precision tests of special relativity.It is also inconsistent with cosmological expansion, and therefore requires the "tired light" hypothesis to hold. But tired light has been conclusively disproved in a number of different ways; for one example, see Blondin et al., "Time Dilation in Type Ia Supernova Spectra at High Redshift," ApJ 682 (2008) 724.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	This is a dull university textbook meant to instruct tender young minds in the philosophy of functional programming, and several of the chapters are on topics that are not likely to be of interest to anyone who isn't using the book as the required text for a course. There is insufficient reference material on the built-in functions and the functions in the language's standard prologue for this book to stand on its own.The author has an annoying habit of using haskell-like pseudocode to explain ideas, without making it clear what is pseudocode and what is real, working code. In addition, the lines of code are interspersed with the text, making it unclear what would constitute a complete, compilable source code file. For example, the discussion of memoization leads off with the standard example of memoizing the naive recursive implementation of the Fibonacci function. First he gives an example of how to memoize it that he clearly marks as not real code that would compile. Then he gives another example that seems to be the one that he is saying would actually compile, but it doesn't compile either. There is no working version of the code on the book's web site, either. After this, he passes on to another example.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	1	1	These days I teach physics for a living, but in 1982 I used this book as a freshman in an honors class. Here are some impressions from going back over the book three decades later.For a student who really wants to know the whys and wherefores of freshman mechanics, I am not aware of any alternative to this book that is available from the traditional publishers. The big-selling texts like Halliday may carefully derive certain things, but in other cases they just pop an equation onto the page and expect the student to use it without question. However, there are many free, online alternatives these days to the big-budget commercial texts, and some of these do provide a level of intellectual honesty similar to K&K;'s.There are many challenging problems that are of very high quality. The focus of these problems is on symbolic rather than numerical computation.The book includes many topics that are not typically included in a freshman text, e.g., nutation, the moment of inertia tensor, and relativistic four-vectors.The book is designed for highly motivated and talented students, at schools with highly selective admissions, who have already taken a rigorous high school physics course, and who have already completed about a year of calculus. It would be a disaster to try to use this book with a less highly selected population.The book shows its age (38 years!) in many ways. It presents various examples of applications of relativity, but they are all extremely old and dusty. Masculine pronouns are used generically. There is no discussion of numerical integration of the equations of motion. Attempts are made to help the student check results of symbolic results, e.g., by giving the output for a specific input, but today this would be far better done using open-source computer software such as LON-CAPA. Diagrams show common student lab apparatus from the Sputnik era. The book predates essentially all modern pedagogical research in physics, and it does not do any of the things that that research shows can have an impact on common conceptual difficulties.To my taste, the treatment of special relativity is dreary and slavishly traditional, with too little geometrical insight.Although the book is overpriced, there is a used market, and since the book hasn't changed in 38 years, students can buy a used copy without worrying about compatibility.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	This album has a lot of songs that are basically alike. They're almost all trite, mid-tempo pop songs about love. Even the chord changes are the same: "icecream changes" (I IV IV V), over and over again, with an augmented chord thrown in as a gimmick on the V chord. Several of the reviewers here have complained that there's not enough material on this disc, but actually by the time I was done listening to it I was wishing that I had heard even less of the same old same old.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	Many other reviewers have covered the same ground here: the point-of-view characters are vivid and engaging, but the storytelling proceeds at a glacial pace. (I lost patience and stopped reading around page 150.)What I haven't seen addressed directly is the complete lack of originality. I kept waiting for a spark of something new, and it never came.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	The point-of-view characters are vivid and engaging. It's difficult for a genre author to succeed with flawed protagonists, since so many readers want adolescent wish fulfillment. Williams manages it very competently.Unfortunately I didn't find much else to like about the book. I lost patience with the glacial pace of the storytelling and stopped reading around page 150. I kept waiting for a spark of originality, and it never came.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	This not really a novel, it's a book-length essay on the philosophy of quantum mechanics.The characters are just mouthpieces, and they all talk like they're giving a physics lecture -- even the protagonist, who's supposed to be a cop. I wouldn't have minded a protagonist who was a physicist and spent all his time giving physics lectures, but a protagonist who is a cop and spends all his time giving physics lectures makes for a pretty deadly lack of believability. Egan also shoots himself in the foot by giving the protagonist reasons to emote (a murdered wife who walks on stage sometimes as a ghost) but making him emotionless (because of brain modifications he's carried out on himself). I could have dealt with a protagonist who was Mr. Spock, but if you're going to give Spock a deep reason to emote, you've got to do something dramatically with that conflict between reason and emotion.The philosophy and science are not really very believable, either. Egan has tried to find a way of dramatizing the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, but in doing that, it seems to me that he's twisted the Copenhagen interpretation into something different -- and more absurd -- than what it really is.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	1	1	I love the song writing on this record. It's impressive how sophisticated the songs can be while using very simple elements. Some of the songs are just a string of images, but the images tell a compelling story.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	I love Lucinda Williams as a songwriter, but this is my least favorite of the records I own by her. The tempos are all slow. The style is basically studio pop. Most of the songs are about lack of connection with other people, which is inherently a difficult thing to write about in an interesting way. I'd skip this one unless you're such a huge fan that you have to own every record she ever made.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	I bought this record after hearing Allyson sing O Pato (not on this disc) on the radio. That tune showed that she could scat like crazy, had a great sense of humor, and a great sense of rhythm. Those qualities are all on display on this disc, but only on the fast tunes. I really, really could have done without the Beatles and Billy Joel songs, and several of the droopy ballads. I ended up deleting tracks 2, 3, 5, 9, and 12. I would have been happier having saved some money and bought tracks 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 individually. If you like real jazz that swings, cooks, and sambas, I suggest you listen to snippets of the different tracks before laying out the money to buy this record as a whole.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	I'm not particularly happy with this dictionary. If you just want to look up words, there are free online dictionaries such as the one at kamusi.org. This dictionary doesn't tell you the noun classes of nouns, which is a severe shortcoming; it means that after looking up a word, you won't be able to tell how to use it grammatically in a sentence, unless you can guess its noun class from its form. Usually you can guess, but I can't imagine how I would have known, for example, that "suruali" (trousers) was class 9 rather than, say, class 5. The only way you'd find that out would be by finding that information somewhere else than in this dictionary. Someone who knows a lot of Swahili may be fairly successful at guessing (e.g., "anga," "sky" is probably class 5 because it refers to a place and a natural phenomenon), but I don't believe that any non-native speaker could guess in all cases, and this will be a particularly tough barrier for beginners.In general, the entries only provide extremely skeletal information. For example, nowhere in the entries for "hungry" or "hunger" does it tell you that the idiom for "to be hungry" is "kuwa na njaa" (to have hunger). The entry for "tungamo" tells you that it translates as "mass," but without giving any other information. "Mass" can mean a lot of things: mass communication, a cancerous mass, the mass of an object. If you then flip to the English-Swahili section and look up "mass," you won't find any clarification, because the only noun listed as a translation back into Swahili is "wingi," which means something different.So if you're sitting at a desk with an internet connection, I don't think you're likely to find this dictionary the most useful resource -- but if you're traveling, it's far too bulky to carry around.I'm a native English speaker, so I don't need the pronunciations given for the English word, but they look a little odd. They all seem to be given for a particular British dialect, so, e.g., "stair" is shown as two syllables, "ste"+schwa. I checked with a British English speaker who seemed to speak a pretty standard, educated London dialect, and she pronounced "stair" as one syllable. I'm sure the pronunciations given here are correct for some dialect in England -- maybe it's the "received pronunciation" dialect of British English that used to be considered the "Queen's English?" East African users of this dictionary should be aware that many of the pronunciations are nothing like what you would hear in Texas or Scotland, and not even necessarily the same as in London.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	1	When you buy this book, you're paying for a glossy, color production with lots of pretty photos of mountains. I would have rather had a black and white book at half the price. There are a few places where the color is used effectively, as in a few of the summary maps that show different hikes in different colors, but for the most part it's just a waste of money to pay for it.The book has no index. If I want to find information about the a particular peak, hut, tram, etc., and its name isn't in the title of one of the hikes listed in the table of contents, then I'm out of luck. All I can do is flip through the entire book scanning for the name on one of the maps -- or go online for information, in which case what was the point of buying the book? It's absurd that anyone is publishing a book like this in the 21st century without an index -- computers have made indexing extremely easy.There are no topo maps, only highly schematized maps with no indication of relief except for lines meant to represent ridge lines. That means that in addition to this expensive book, you're also going to have to buy maps separately.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	1	1	This is a best-of-breed book. Its highlight is the extensive use of relativity to develop the idea of electromagnetism as the first unified field theory. Although the book does present the mathematical tools of vector calculus from scratch, it is clearly designed for students who are physics majors, have had a substantial high school physics course, and have had strong mathematical preparation. I would not dare to use this book to teach an E&M; course to a less elite audience.The use of cgs units in this book is IMO a nuisance. Given the book's emphasis on relativity as a link between electricity and magnetism, it's nice to use a system in which E and B have the same units. However, I prefer to handle this by using SI units and writing Maxwell's equations with the coupling constants expressed as k and k/c^2, which makes the relativistic links almost as evident and allows a much easier connection with practical laboratory measurements.The book is extremely old, and although Maxwell's equations haven't changed, some of the discussion of experimental evidence, e.g., bounds on the non-neutrality of the hydrogen atom, are many decades out of date.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	1	1	When curious but less mathematically inclined students ask me for a book on relativity, this is one of two that I usually point them to. The other is Takeuchi's An Illustrated Guide to Relativity. The two books are fairly similar in that they both present special relativity from a heavily visual and geometrical point of view. Takeuchi has cute cartoons and is nonthreatening. Mermin's book is deeper and more rigorous, and also a lot less entertaining. By analogy, there are many historical anecdotes about famous figures such as Abraham Lincoln who put significant time into mastering Euclid's Elements in depth. This is the type of person who will like Mermin's book. (For those who just want armchair reading, Gardner's Relativity Simply Explained is wonderful, although painfully out of date when it comes to certain topics such as black holes and, especially, cosmology.)Mermin has spent many years at Cornell teaching a course on relativity for students who are not science majors. His presentation is highly polished. If you want to get an idea of how Mermin's book is structured, a pretty complete presentation of the same ideas is available from his Cornell web page. (I don't think Amazon will let me include a URL, but you can find it by googling.)Mermin is similar to Takeuchi in that both books do a good job in their first halves of presenting relativistic kinematics, and both, in my view, start to get bogged down in the second half, where they deal with dynamics. Mermin discusses the link between conservation of momentum and the frame-independence of conservation of energy; this will go way over the heads of typical students in a gen ed class. I strongly dislike the discussion of relativistic momentum. Mermin gives a plausibility argument and pretends that it has established the correct result, whereas in fact it is logically necessary either to add a further postulate or (preferably) make contact with experiment.Like Takeuchi, Mermin starts logically from Einstein's 1905 postulates. I dislike this approach, because 107 years later we can see that it was clearly a historical mistake to assign a special role to light (which was the only fundamental field known in 1905). It obscures the modern point of view, which is that relativity is fundamentally a theory of space, time, and causality. It's odd that Mermin would choose a title that so aggressively states the modern view, but an axiomatization that is stuck a century in the past. In fact, a more appropriate set of postulates was given as early as 1911 by Ignatowsky, and there are many nice pedagogical presentations such as the one in Morin's mechanics textbook and Palash B. Pal, "Nothing but Relativity," arXiv:physics/0302045v1.Mermin gives a logically correct justification of the area-preserving property of Lorentz transformations, whereas Takeuchi gives an erroneous argument.The spacetime interval is presented geometrically as the area of a light-rectangle (a rectangle in the x-t plane whose edges are lightlike and which has the events of interest lying at opposite ends of a diagonal). This is cute and fits well with the geometrical approach of the book. An interesting alternative nonmathematical characterization is given in Geroch's General Relativity from A to B.There is a lot of other geometrical machinery and terminology in the book that I found less well motivated. Some of this seems to be because Mermin prefers not to present his graphical representations of spacetime with a coordinate grid in the background. I can understand the philosophical preference for a coordinate-free approach, but to my taste this aspect of the presentation seems a little less lucid than it might have been.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	I normally love Pohl's work, but this didn't work for me at all. After fifty pages I started skimming, and after a hundred I gave up. I couldn't get interested in the characters, and the story was taking forever to get off the ground.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	This book takes an intrinsically fascinating subject and manages to make it dull. There is no spark of excitement or originality to be found anywhere in this plodding catalog of utopian communities. The analysis is at the superficial level I would expect in a high school term paper; for example, the authors will frequently introduce a particular utopian community by giving a list of six or eight adjectives, with a citation to someone else's work, where that list of adjectives was given. The first half of the book, about anabaptist communities, is especially dull and repetitive because many of these communities were so similar to each other.The book also reminded me of high school work because of the authors' poor grasp of the basic mechanics of English composition. Mistakes in grammar and punctuation are frequent enough to be extremely distracting. Didn't the publisher hire a copy editor to correct dangling participles, comma splices, and the klutzy stringing together of nouns modifying other nouns? The writing is poorly organized, and there is a lack of transitions between paragraphs and sections.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	0	0	This book described a teaching technique that was considered innovative in 1996, and it was highly influential.It has some very sensible recommendations: Don't introduce material in lecture form, but make students read the book for that purpose (and use reading quizzes to enforce that). Test concepts and not just calculations.It has a useful survey of the relevant pedagogical literature as of 1996, including data showing that following the book's recommendations improves conceptual understanding without hurting students' problem-solving abilities.Most of the book consists of a collection of resources to be used in teaching using the technique it advocates.None of this, however, is a valid reason to pay $35 for this book in the year 2012. The relevant pedagogical research from that era can basically be found in one paper:Hake, "Interactive Engagement Versus Traditional Methods: a Six-Thousand Student Survey of Mechanics Test Data for Introductory Physics Courses, Am. J. of Phys, 66 (1997) 64More recent pedagogical research along the same lines is all available online for free from authors such as Hake and Halloun.The resources included in the book are not worth paying money for. You can get similar "conceptest" items at the Project Galileo web site. The standardized diagnostic tests described in the book are available for free in more convenient form if you contact the authors of the tests, and these tests have been updated and improved as a result of ongoing research since 1996. Furthermore, the resources in the book are full of errors, such as multiple-choice conceptest questions that are formatted such that there is no correct answer, and that therefore can't be used successfully for the teaching technique being advocated.
A1E50HHYCSD1HO	1	1	For a long time there's been a need for an up to date graduate text on GR. The classics are Wald and MTW, but at the interface with experiment, those both predate LIGO, Gravity Probe B, modern studies of CMB anisotropy, and the discoveries of supermassive black holes and the nonzero cosmological constant. Carroll's book is a little less austere and scary than Wald, more concise than MTW. At this point it's the book that I would point a first-year grad student to. It's wonderful that the book is also available online for free at ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll_contents.html .
A1E53JYTMIMES8	1	1	This film is creepy, gross and beautiful. The atmosphere is perfect right away, with the storm approaching. It was interesting to find out in the extras why these adult women acted so juvenile. It's because Argento originally wanted to use children in the roles, but I guess he and a collaborator thought using kids would be too difficult. It's also interesting that the film was based on a real story that Argento's former girlfriend was told when she was a kid. This turns up the creep factor when you think of how people acted like nothing strange was going on, mainly the women running the dance school. It took a lot of imagination to think of how to kill off these characters. Some of the ways are really sadistic, and are meant to make people suffer.
A1E53JYTMIMES8	1	1	It started with a woman doing a very stupid thing, where you want to say "are you crazy?" Women in horror films seem to put themselves in harm's way for no good reason. The beginning was creepy and the mood continued by being bizarre. I was suspicious of everyone, wondering who was in on it. Argento films are great also because of the interior design of the sets, or the buildings he had transformed.
A1E53JYTMIMES8	0	0	I'm not sure why it has this title, unless it refers to the victims. I guess something got lost in translation.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	I thoroughly enjoyed this chronicle of one thruhiker's journey on the Appalachian Trail, reading the entire thing in one night when I should have been doing other work. Rubin is candid, humorous, and brutally honest about himself, his shortcomings, and his complex relationships with others (particularly his wife Cathy). He acknowledges upfront that his reasons for tackling the AT are somewhat nebulous, though it appears a sense of ennui with life and his editorial job are the main culprits.Here is AT subculture in all its glory - Rubin has both amusing and sobering accounts of his fellow hikers. There is a woman who stays true to her makeup regimen every day before hiking, a couple obsessive about analyzing their every move on the Trail, and a bragging yuppie type trying to save face in light of the emptiness inside. Rubin ventures into deeper ruminations: Why do hikers adopt a temporary "trail name"/identity for the experience? How do you cope with those you leave behind? How do they cope? While he can't offer quick-fix answers, he deals with these questions on a level that's refreshing to see (unlike Bill Bryson's book, where he leaves his wife and four kids for weeks on the AT and hardly expresses an afterthought).There are a few sections where Rubin's trains of thought are long-winded, or he uses far too many words to get to the point. He hiked the AT in 1997 and his chronicles about learning of Princess Di's death early that fall give the book a dated and forced "where-were-you-when" feel. Far more eerie was a short description of how the top floors of the Twin Towers are the first things he can see and identify in the Manhattan skyline.In the end, however, it is clear that he has a lot of wisdom to offer after his time on the Trail - both his own quotable passages and well-chosen verses and phrases from Walt Whitman, Thoreau, and John McPhee that he has selected for chapter openers and for his own philosophical discourses. In one of the more memorable sections of the book, he realizes why his complacent behavior at the office made the job turn sour for him. His issues may not be 100% resolved at Katahdin, but the book finishes with a true sense of having completed something worthwhile, and being the better off for it.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	This is a gripping story about teenage Meliara's attempts to lead a band of rebels into war against a tyrannical king and against all odds. The bulk of the story deals with her capture by the enemy, her escape, and her ensuing flight throughout the countryside of Remalna, trying to evade King Galdran's men. Smith's writing is tight, and often lyrical - she's capable of expressing beautiful scenes dealing with nature, friendship, and kindness in the midst of the seemingly hopeless cause of Mel and her brother, Branaric.The action of "Crown Duel" is erratic, unpredictable, and far from clich&eacute;. This is well-suited to nave Meliara's disposition and impulsive actions. Both her foolhardy and more thoughtful, logical actions seem to land her in trouble. I like how Smith included the gritty reality of camp life and Mel's stint as a fugitive - too often these details seem to be missing in fantasy novels, possibly at the risk of sounding too mundane. But for Mel, her need to find food, water, or a bed for the night drive her actions as much as anything else.There are a few reasons why I felt the book didn't deserve a fifth star...throughout the course of the tale, Mel is rescued in the nick of time too often. I wish she'd fight or use her wits to find her own way out of a serious situation for once. Smith's attempt to give the brother a distinct, fun-loving voice seems very contrived - I'd like a nickel for every time Bran uses the silly expletive, "Life!" or the phrase, "Burn it, Mel..." And there is no map!! It's an old clich&eacute; that "No Tour of Fantasyland is complete without one," yet this book could have really used one. There are enough descriptions of the Tlanth countryside that Mel is so familiar with, and has even mapped herself, to warrant one. Obviously the geography of her world was very clear in Smith's own mind, but all of Mel's travels, military strategy, and landscape descriptions made no spatial sense at all.Still a very satisfying read that will leave you eager for the even better sequel.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	Things felt somewhat resolved at the end of "Crown Duel" - especially in the young Countess Meliara's mind, who is content to remain at her family's estate in Tlanth with her childhood friends. She spends her days sprucing up the castle that's fallen in to disrepair and building a new library. The sudden arrival of a court entourage from Remalna's capital, headed by her brother Branaric, reminds Mel that she still has personal scores to settle. In spite of herself, she is soon bound for court life in Remalna-city.While this book lacks the constant action of the first, it is still a terrific read. "Court Duel" is where I feel Meliara truly comes into her own. She is more humble, more thoughtful, and fully aware of her ignorance. This she tries to correct by reading every book she can get her hands on. The descriptions of the party she carefully prepares for her brother and his intended, are superb. This project of hers and the task of sorting out the intrigues of court life have their effect on Mel - we see her growing more scrutinizing and diplomatic, perhaps a hint at the potential ruler within her.Meliara develops a wonderful correspondence, and then courtship, with a secret admirer. I looked forward to her next letter from the "Unknown" with some of Mel's own anticipation. For the reader, the one who belongs to the intelligent, well-read, witty voice of the letters is easy to guess. Yet the scene where he reveals himself is so well-crafted and romantic (!) that I doubt the reader will mind.The true climax comes as something of a surprise, with the abrupt introduction of full-blown magic into a (previously) magic-free world. The ending feels forced and too hasty. Smith does a commendable job of keeping the true culprit appropriately in the background for most of the book. Perhaps it reads so strangely because it is the first plot clich&eacute; of the book - tree people overtaking the sorcerer? Sounds suspiciously like Tolkien's Saruman and the Ents...
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	I heard the gravelly voice and incredible lyrics of Tom Waits for the first time two years ago on a friend's copy of "Mule Variations." While my exposure to the wide breadth of his past material and musical evolution has been gradual, I became a fast and devoted fan. "Rain Dogs" is the third of his albums that I bought, and what a piece of work it is.There's such a variety of sounds on this album - "Rain Dogs" truly showcases Waits's ability to take any musical style and call it his own. The album starts out with versions of Waits's classic junket band, a sound that first entranced me with the much later "Cold Water". The first three tracks ("Singapore," "Clap Hands," and the weird "Cemetary Polka") are a ramble down the bizzare and dark. The title track lies in the middle of the album, and begins with a melancholy accordian solo, then becomes a delightful romp in the life of the "Rain Dogs," who "...danced and swallowed the night / For it was so ripe for dreaming." A more country sound is present in the earthy "Gun Street Girl" and the twangy melancholy of "Blind Love." It's an incredibly varied album, yet Waits still fuses it all together somehow.The Uptown Horns, a brash and boisterous quartet of sax, trumpet and trombone players, contributed their talents to most of this album, much to the delight of the listener. There is the instrumental entitled "Midtown" - an explosion of brass that sounds like it's setting the scene for a private eye flick. For other songs, one or two of the horn players often accompany Waits's vocals. The trombone player of the band contributes to my favorite song on the album, "Tango Till They're Sore." This is a delightful piano-and-trombone croon that evokes wee-hour gatherings with friends after a long, staggering night out: "Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair / Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs / I tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past / Send me off to bed forevermore..."Waits is an outstanding songwriter and poet, and the lyrics for all the songs on "Rain Dogs" never fail to be vivid and poignant. Whimsical ("Diamonds and Gold") or cruel ("Ninth &amp; Hennepin"), all evoke clear, unusual, and very human images that are unmatched by other songwriters -- no wonder Tom Waits is one of the most covered artists of our time."Anywhere I Lay my Head" is last on the list. With the Uptown Horns playing a slow, taps-like accompaniment, Waits croons with his signature voice, "I don't need anybody / Because I learned to be alone / And anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys / I will call my home." The horn quartet caps it off with a boistrous oom-pahing coda, you can almost see them strutting away down Bourbon Street. Undoubtedly one of the best finishes to an album I've ever heard.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	Loved my first Tom Waits album "The Heart of Saturday Night" for its jazzed-up late-night-ramblings feel to it. This was before owning "Small Change," however, and here the ante is upped and Waits delves even deeper into the heart of the diners and back alleys of urban America.All my favorite songs on this album are a testament to Waits's tremendous versatility. There is the silvertongue scat "Step Right Up..." the jazz dive "The One that Got Away..." the atmospheric "Small Change..." the weep-into-your-beer "Invitation to the Blues." "Invitation" and "Tom Traubert's Blues" (Waltzing Mathilda) are accompanied by heartbreaking strings and piano. The sax and string bass on some of the more jazzed-up tracks are pretty tight.BTW I completely agree with the reviewer below that "I Can't Wait to Get off Work" would have been better middle-album filler, its slot as the final track of the album is somewhat bewildering. Of all the songs of the album that he could have ended on, this one is mediocre at best. The title track would have been the better choice - he used this to close a live performance on "Austin City Limits" in the late 70s and it was incredible. I'm insanely jealous of anyone who managed to be in the audience that night. For the rest of us, PBS still sometimes airs the reruns, so try and catch it sometime - really is something to see and as far as I know, no recordings of it are commercially available.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	0	1	Came to the theatre today looking for more philosophical brain food for thought (similar to the Oracle and the Architect's dialogue in "Reloaded") than what delivered. Instead all the dialogue was just drivel, and many of the main characters (Morpheus in particular) were marginalized. The wagering between Morpheus/Trinity and the Merovingian created some excellent tension - which was negated, then forgotten. E.g. his request to "bring me the eyes of the Oracle" as he toys with 2 martini olives on a toothpick. Makes you shudder, eh? And the subway-station limbo world was an intriguing setting that I hoped they would explore more; instead the Oracle wager is quickly abandoned and Neo is whisked away.So, instead of true substance, the movie was overwhelmed with clich&eacute; and useless feely-good subplots. We have the overzealous (dare I say obnoxious) 16-year old who wants to fight in the war and somehow manages to outlast all the seasoned war generals. The Indian family that wanted to save their young daughter seemed an artificial ploy to extract some sympathy from the audience. And I wanted to bang my head against the wall during Trinity's long spiel to Neo, where all the old Hollywood "I love you" clich&eacute;s are recycled.The final fight between Smith and Neo in the rain seemed the high point of the movie - visually stunning and on par with the visuals of the prior films. But again, soo much potential that quickly plummets. It seemed the writers caught themselves in a bind here - both Smith and Neo have already proven that they are indestructible while in the matrix and thus cannot destroy each other physically. Then Smith seems to be hovering on the verge of existential crisis (lack of purpose) and I thought this would be cool, having his downfall rooted in the existential, rather than the physical realm. But no, we just get a series of inexplicable, blinding-white explosions. In the final scene we have characters I could care less about making cryptic comments and flinging the Sequel door wide open. So what, now there is peace? I.e. no more conflict between the machine world and humans, each just coexists? Do the machines continue to use embryonic humans to fuel their existence and the "awakened" humans are still relegated to their (now destroyed) underground lair? Seems to me the humans still get the short end of the stick...
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	One of my favorite books of all time, hands down. Rip-roaring adventure, fascinating new characters, humor, romance, and a dramatic climax. This is a triumphant end to T. Pierce's great series. Most of the merits of this book have already been outlined here, and in greater detail. The real reason for my review is below, and be warned that it contains spoilers.In Alanna's choice of George, Pierce illustrates a point that is, unfortunately, lost on most young readers. For my part, I know that when I was 13, the fact that Alanna ended up with George disappointed and escaped me. Over time, a few re-readings, and relationships of my own, however, the ending becomes more and more fitting.For many years I dated a guy whom I loved with all my heart. Slowly however, I realized what a huge piece of myself I'd given to him. He had fallen for an offbeat, punk chick like myself and couldn't wrap his conservative sensibilities around it. Whenever I spoke in confidence with him about my dreams of being a freelance writer, artist, world-traveler, etc., he became very indignant - because it took time away from being with him.Every Christmas, birthday, etc. I received bland clothes and heaps of jewelery. Like Jon's intentions for Alanna, he wanted me to sit idly through life and be queen of his suburbanite castle, while my deep-seated dreams went by the wayside.George stood by Alanna, never questioned her, always yielded his support for her adventures and who she wanted to be. Interesting how Jon's status as a prince and Alanna's first love will make young fans skim over and ignore his actions and the asinine things he says to her in book three. Jon is an a$s. They are clearly incompatible. Let go of your old fairytale notions, seek your own independence and a companion who will help you along that journey.
A1E5B2QDXYIFD6	1	1	I was hard-pressed to decide if the fourth, fifth, or sixth book has been my favorite of the series so far. "Goblet of Fire" is my favorite of the films, with a great storyline, so I have a fondness for it in that respect. "Order of the Phoenix" was certainly gripping, though Harry is almost unbearable in it. I wondered at times if he was channeling a pouty "Attack of the Clones" Hayden Christensen and if Rowling had worn out her Caps Lock key while writing that book. Granted, Harry's behavior is understandable with all that has happened (who WASN'T angry at the world 15)? And despite his teenage angst, the storyline was fantastic (especially anything involving the Pensieve) and the many laugh-out-loud scenes - mostly provided by the Weasley twins - help to balance the book.Many have criticized the slower pace, lengthy backstory, and keeping "The Half-Blood Prince" set mostly at Hogwarts. We know that graver things lie ahead for Harry even before the book ends; I at least feel he deserves a year a Hogwarts, the first place known as a true "home," to enjoy friends, his Quidditch captaincy, and (at last) love. Finally he seems more at home in his school and own skin. The attempts to Apparate into a wooden hoop illustrate that there is still much that he and his classmates have to learn.Reading along, I was reminded that they are, all gifts and magical capabilities aside, simply a group of teenagers. I am a high school teacher and amazed at how Rowling hits the nail on the head, again and again, of what it is like to be in the company of teens in an academic setting all day. The lessons may involve how to perform magical spells and a world entirely not our own, but the behavior is universal. Sports, friendship, rivalries, loyalties, and the blunders (and triumphs) of love take center stage. Won-Won's first "love" (or is it?) provides most of the humor.The story of Lord Voldemort's youth, and rise to power, is recounted in a series of meetings between Harry and Dumbledore. Harry helps the headmaster reason out much of their enemy's background with the aid of the Pensieve and some patchy memories that show the early Tom Riddle. We (along with Harry) gain essential insight into how Voldemort became the Dark Lord. At last, Dumbledore has taken Harry into his full confidence. With this mentor, gone is Harry's frustration of earlier books where he was constantly told, "it is for your own good," with no further explanation.The new Potions professor, Slughorn, is a fantastic addition to the story. I loved the analogy that he was a large spider, tending to his web of carefully-collected prize flies. Probably my favorite part of the book was when Harry drank the "lucky" potion, Felix Felicius. What follows is some of the best storytelling in the book as Harry smoothly directs the key player in his favor, with the aid of another, slightly more common "potion." You can't help but grin as you are carried along with Harry's newfound brazenness, and the results couldn't play out more in his favor.My only complaint is that, except some foreshadowing and the climax of the book, very little is done with Professor Snape. Sure, Harry spies on him a lot and they have their run-ins around Hogwarts, detentions, and lots of collective sneering. But what happens in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Harry's best and favorite subject, under Snape's new appointment? After their disastrous Occlumency lessons, Snape's constant coveting of the position, and so many scenes where Snape bullied Harry during Potions, we have little idea of what transpires in the class. This would have been a great opportunity to build more tension and ambiguity that, unfortunately, Rowling did not use at all.Still, I commend her brilliance in creating this book, my favorite in an outstanding series. I get the sense she could choose any genre or niche market in the book industry - coming of age, mystery, adventure, children's, young adult, humor, adult fiction - and still turn out an outstanding piece of writing. Fortunately, she made the choice to combine all these themes into one tale of the "Boy Who Lived," and has created one of the best series I have read in years.
A1E5DVHYS3TQVG	0	1	I picked up this paperback when I was short on reading material. Mysteries are one of my favorite genres and the byline on this one is "Murder in Hollywood's Heydey". I would say that it is adequately written, a rather backhanded compliment.Forgettable plot and storyline, no characters that are even interesting, much less unique or that you really care about or pull for or against.Not recommended unless you are desperate for something just to pass the time in the waiting room.
A1E5DVHYS3TQVG	0	0	In my opinion, Cold Service is a mere shadow of the kind of writing Robert B. Parker did at some earlier points in his career. That said, looking back, I have to admit that I now believe Parker has always been overrated by many readers, including me.In this novel, Spenser and Hawk are reduced to little more than their usual macho bravado and banter. There's just not much substance here, and more unfortunate, not much entertainment value either. Has Parker gotten lax in success? or has he just burned out or run out of ideas? As much as I've enjoyed a few of his earlier works, he really wasn't that great to begin with.
A1E5DVHYS3TQVG	1	1	I have tried many different types of lotion and moisturizers, and Alpha Hydrox works best for me. My problem is dry, flaking skin. Alpha Hydrox moisturizes and exfoliates at the same time! Nothing else I have tried has made my skin clear and healthy like Alpha Hydrox. I have no association with this product or this company, except as a satisfied customer! I have been using Alpha Hydrox for years, and although I have tried many other products - I always come back to this one.
A1E5DVHYS3TQVG	1	0	I purchased this book for my wife, who wanted a devotional guide that was encouraging and positive. This is it! The author is wonderful, my wife loves it.
A1E5L1QFF60KWF	0	0	Bought this at Lowes after reading the reviews here. Completely useless for tilling or removing weeds, even in soft dirt. I don't understand the favorable ratings...this simply does not work effectively and a simple hoe would finish more quickly and with less physical effort.
A1E5L1QFF60KWF	1	1	Ordered just before a long flight, really made a difference compared to the cheap earbuds I have been using. Comfortable fit and amazing audio quality. As others have noted, a low quality recording will sound worse. I noticed a big improvement with large WMA files compared to MP3's...you can actually hear the difference when listening with a computer,quality is a bit lower with a PDA. Definitely recommend.
A1E5MQ7IQXZ646	1	1	Gotta have my coffee in the morning...had the fancy Krups double unit with coffee pot on one side and espresso/frother on the other. Trouble was A: I always make too much or too little coffee (dumping excess coffee $$$ down the drain), B: You must wait for it to brew (Grind beans, measure coffee, get filter, fill pot, pour water, brew...wait), C: the espresso/frother were such an inconvenience I rarely used it (and the frother clogged really easy).Enter the Tassimo. I've had mine for about a year now and love it. No more wasted pots of coffee! You can start your day with your favorite coffee and move on to a latte or hot chocolate without wasting anything! I read reviews of other machines like the Senseo where people claim the coffee was weak/not hot. Not so with the Tass. You can select from a wide variety of coffees to suit your taste (mild-strong), they are the perfect temperature (goldilocks would be pleased), and best of all, you can let it "auto brew" or you can manually stop the brewing early for a stronger cup or extend the brewing to weaken it if you choose.The cappucinos taste great and are as good as one you'd buy at the coffee house. You can't entertain a crowd with it though, as it takes about 1 min per beverage. My only other gripe is I'd wish they'd get Starbucks discs...sigh. My fave, but realize not for everyone. They keep adding more and more brands of discs/pods so I'm hopeful maybe one day...Check the tassimo site as they run specials and promos on machines/discs and introductory offers...if you can't wait Bed Bath & Beyond carries them also so just use your coupons that they send practically every day in your mail.I've had a for quite some time with no hint of problems..cleans up easy...really happy with it. My favorite kitchen appliance. Hope this helps!
A1E5MQ7IQXZ646	1	1	This is a wonderful collection (and Fr. Jerome Vereb is to be credited for such a fine harvest) of excerpts from speeches, official papal edicts, simple prayers, and even some of his poetry. It is a journey and small glimpse into the mind of one the most deeply spiritual and faithful people of the 20th century. He is widely credited with helping end the the cruel and brutal human experiment with communism in eastern europe. But he also evangelized me, one tiny person, and led me to become Catholic. Each day has a short (1-3 paragraphs) read on a variety of topics and follows the liturgical year of events. I try to read this book every day to have a deeper understanding of him and my own faith.Proin vitae evangelicae vestrae patientiam et me ad Deum!

A1E5OHQ1UJT0UM	1	1	Searched many pages for whistling tea kettle.Found many with either unsatisfactory customer reviews, or kettles that were way too pricey. Finally, found this small kettle, only $7.95 plus shipping.It is Kamenstein Aluminum, 2 qt. It does whistle, but takes longer to get to the rolling boil. It is easy to fill, light weight, and just what I need to heat water for my daily tea!
A1E5Y3I3TYCKGU	1	1	I got these about three weeks ago, and still haven't used them up yet. So many batteries. Awesome. So far, they've lasted about four times as long in my Canon digital point-and-shoot than my Energizer rechargeables. And they're on track to outperform the regular Energizers in my Xbox controllers. I think I'm a coppertop convert. The price is pretty good, too--probably not the absolute cheapest, but these are real Duracells (not knockoffs) that are far from their expiration date.
A1E5Y3I3TYCKGU	1	1	I got this Empire State flag for my New York-themed office. Within minutes of putting it up, someone stopped by and commented,"You have the best office I have ever seen." Maybe it's the custom decor and lighting, maybe it was the flag. I'm going with the flag.Anyway, more about the flag. It's dark blue, like the clean, nutrient-rich waters of the Hudson, and it has two stuck-up chicks on it, including one who refuses to make eye contact with you or anyone else on the subway. It also features a shield with a mountain and some boats on it--not sure what that's supposed to be, but I'm thinking it's probably Jersey, since there are no mountains on Lawn Guyland, and you don't need boats to get there: you can take the LIRR. I don't know for sure, though, since I don't go west of 10th Ave. It also has an eagle, which doesn't make sense, since I'm pretty sure the city--er, state--bird is the pigeon. And don't forget the scroll that reads EXCELSIOR, or "Ever Upward," which is the official motto of the New York State and City taxation departments.If you're still on the fence about this purchase, consider these two facts:1. This flag costs less than five dollars. Come on. You can pony up $4.90.2. The seal is actually LARGER THAN LIFE. Yes, it takes up pretty much the entire flag, with less of a border than shown in the picture. That way, there is ZERO ambiguity about what state flag this is. And you can see all of the glorious details that the original designers wanted us to see when they created the seal back in 1778. Like Liberty's mani/pedi, and Justice's highlights.
A1E61YBW8QRROC	1	1	To put this together you don't need tools or screws....everything just snaps right into place. I had all kinds of tools all over my shed and now they're standing up in this gadget and I can actually walk around in there!
A1E61YBW8QRROC	1	1	It is very smooth...I had expected it to foam as you pump based on the name, but you can just lather it up in your hands instead. I think it feels fresh and clean.
A1E61YBW8QRROC	1	1	I know that I could see the dimensions before purchase, but I was pleasantly surprised at how deep the drawers were. It's sturdy enough and I think it'll be a good way to store all my nails, screws, nuts, bolts and more...The bottom drawers are even big enough for some packaged nails and screws.
A1E61YBW8QRROC	1	1	I like it so far! Not a long enough handle to use much on a hot grill, but it's great for scooping food from a baking sheet!
A1E69ZPP8N45K4	0	1	The first time I heard Jimmy Smith and his Hammond B-3 was in a Houston barbershop 35 years ago. When I left, my new haircut and I went straight to the old Don's Record Shop in Bellaire and bought the album.What struck me when I listened to the entire LP was that the tune I had heard at the barbershop was the only really good one of the bunch. It was the only one were Smith was the soloist.Since that time, I've added another five or so of Smith's recordings to my collection, plus the latest one &quot;Dot Com Blues.&quot; Nothing has changed. He's still rarely the soloist. There's no more than a couple of cuts that are memorable.And that's the way it is with &quot;Dot Com Blues.&quot; Quite frankly, the only thing of value on &quot;Dot Com Blues&quot; is the first cut -- Smith and Dr. John. The rest are Smith using his standard non-tremolo drawbar set-up, rolling the same cords for what seems to be hours at a time, all the while accompanying another soloist.Jimmy Smith is enormously talented -- the last of the truly great B-3 players. I wish he'd put together one CD where he plays standard well-known jazz tunes in his style and lets the Hammond B-3 be the lead and the solo instrument. If I heard him for the first time 35 years ago, simple math leads me to believe his time may be running out.
A1E69ZPP8N45K4	1	1	The first time I heard Gatemouth was in 1952 as a 7th grader. His 78 rpm record, &quot;The Okie Dokie Stomp&quot; was on the cafeteria jukebox, and it played over and over and over again during the lunch hour.Then a few years later I was lucky enough to get my own DJ show on one of the local Galveston radio stations. I chose &quot;The Okie Dokie Stomp&quot; for my theme song and it stayed with me for as long as I was known a Brokenhearted Bill.Gatemouth must be in his late 70s by now, but his style with a guitar has never been successfully copied. Many have tried. If you like the blues, Gatemouth needs to be included in your collection, and this CD is a good place to start.
A1E69ZPP8N45K4	0	1	I bought one of these for a Christmas present for my brother and one for me. We're both connoiseurs of this music.When all was said and done, there is most certainly some good stuff here, and it's fairly representative of that era. But quite frankly, there are way too many 2nd and 3rd rate cuts included to make this set worth owning.I played mine so few times that I don't even know where it is any more. I'm especially sorry I gave one to my brother for Christmas. He deserved better.
A1E69ZPP8N45K4	1	1	When you think of the Four Freshmen, you can't help but think of &quot;Graduation Day,&quot; &quot;Charmaine,&quot; &quot;Day by Day,&quot; and the zillion others that became their standards of the 50s.I found his new CD by accident. It begins with the Sinatra hit, &quot;Come Fly with Me.&quot; The harmony is unmistakenly Freshmen, but the selections as well as the ochestrations are full and awesome. No Freshmen playing solo trombones, etc.If you like the Four Freshmen, this CD could easily become your favorite. I've had my copy about 5 years, and it has kept its place on my 101 CD player the entire time. There probably aren't 5 others that have been there that long.
A1E69ZPP8N45K4	1	1	When I was young, caberet singers weren't that hard to find in Manhattan. But times have changed. If you take away Bobby Short, most of the old timers have passed on or stopped performing.While Stacey Kent lives in England, when I heard this CD it came to mind that she was the ideal performer for the famous Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room on W44th St. I wrote the hotel to give them that suggestion and sent along a cassette of this CD.They must have liked what they heard, because only a few months later, Stacey played very successful gig there.She has an unusual timber -- reminds me of one of my favorite singers of the past, Joni Sommers. If you don't know Stacey Kent, this CD is a good way to meet her.
A1E6ACGMG4MMWY	0	0	Do not waste your money on this. Mine rusted within a week. It literally fell apart after 4 months. The spark arrester fell of. This is flimsy at best. It is a very nice looking unit, but that's it. I had Whalens pit for 6 years. I replaced the screen once. I miss that thing. I gave it to someone who still uses it.
A1E6ACGMG4MMWY	1	1	This cover is relatively inexpensive for what you get. Quite durable with plenty of room for 6 chairs. Great for winter storage. What a pleasure it was to take the cover off and find the chairs clean and ready to use.
A1E6ACGMG4MMWY	1	1	I searched for a while for a durable large tray. The tray is great for bringing everything in from the grill in one trip. My wife uses it quite a bit to bring large assortments of snacks outside for the kids and their friends. It has no slip corners tha are great for outdoor glass tables.
A1E6ACGMG4MMWY	1	1	I was quoted (a minimum) of $1500.00 to replace my sand filter and chlorinator. I had a Hayward pump already. It came well packaged. I replaced everything myself. I saved at least $1100.00. The sand filter directions are not that good for a new installation. I just took a few pictures of the original set-up. I had no help at all. Sand replacement directions can be easily found on line. After all was said and done, I plugged the pump in and the flow worked perfectly. My pool water is noticeably cleaner. Great deal!
A1E6ACGMG4MMWY	1	1	This is a great product. I ahave actually ordered more of their stuff: napkin holders and a larger version of this. I highly recommend these products. For the price, they cannot be beat.
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	Sound effect is excellent. The war scenes and stroied are closer to what I have heard from veterans from Viet Nam where more civilians were dead that WWII.
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	Ocean scenes are always great to see. Audio/Video quality is good. I like the background music.
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	When I was a kid in Korea, I usally saw animation movies - mostof them were Sci-Fi stroies with violences. I was surprised how ananimation movie can give me such peace and comfort. I suddenly felt how much I have been addicted to unnecessary violences and stimulus of movies from Hollywood or Disney. Maybe, it is true that I am also addicted to caffeine and other stuffs. It is important to realize that we are living everyday polluted with something... I believe this movie can do it for some people. A great animation movie..
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	Because I liked Mozard Piano Concerto No. 20 D minor, I ordered this DVD. It supports Dolby Digital 5.1 Channel. I am satisfied with sound and video quality. It was enjoyable to see Gulda play the piano and direct a small orchestra team in the sweat of his brow, because I had listened this music just by LP stereo. I am not quite sure what else I may expect more from this kind of concerto DVD. I think the only flaw is that the noise and applauding sounds from the audience seats were too large. There are a few bonus materials in this title.
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	When I was in Korea about ten years ago, I heard about this movie, but I have not seen this move until DVD is released recently.This movie is not for everyone, because it is hard to understand Zen and other underlying stories (also the cinematography). I am not a Buddhist, but I think I know better than usual Western viewers. Keep in mind that my review is of novice.At first scene, you hear very loud warning sounds from traffic signals and sounds of a train passing by. The sounds from wooden bells carried by Buddhists have been used to open the closed minds of common people (fools) by the strong wave energy penetrating into their inner minds. You later hear sounds of the wooden bell by the monk in the market. Also, you can hear various sounds from metallic bells and others in the movie.The Zen koan is also used to open the closed mind by sudden striking force. You can not easily escape from old habits, stereotypes and various beliefs which you have accumulated and learned after your birth. To cut those connections which are usually obstacles to the Way to enlightenment, you need some sudden and strong force. A sound or koan can be used for this purpose.'Karma' is a basic principle to make the story in the movie. The boy killed a bird. He later suffered in water. The cow symbolizes a kind of lucky guider when you are struggling to escape from darkness. Due to any kind of guider, you can have a chance to move toward the enlightenment or Nirvana, which is given because you have accomplished somethings or have helped other lives during the past life.The woman wearing black Korean cloth is the boy's mother. She appeared in the dream of the boy when he struggled to escape from a crisis. I could not interpret who is the woman who danced when the old monk (master) was to pass away.There are other 'karma' stories overlapping each other, but I could not interpret all of them. I believe I can understand most of stories, after seeing the movie several times more.What is the answer to the title, &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot;. My primary answer is that he left because he could not stay at the same place any longer.
A1E6RW8B79CXUS	1	1	As a native Korean, I enjoyed the book despite my handicap in reading in English. It was interesting to know what Westerners think about reincarnation.This book certainly is based on scientific skepticism. I enjoyed the tours into Lebanon and India, where everyone must be a kind of philosopher to survive in such miserable conditions. Reincarnation is a question for life and death, endless cyclic struggles to maturity.One objection to the author is that scientific experiments are feasible for validating or falsifying the concept of reincarnation. Several years ago, I watched a commercial TV show made in Korea that compared the predictions by two persons who insisted that they can track down or can see the past lives of people. One person was a psychiatrist who uses hypnoanalysis, and the other was a psychie who allegedly was able to see the images of the past lives. In the sense of blind experiment, the descriptions of the past lives of several subjects by the two person were nearly coincident. If rate of coincidence is statistically significant, you may reject a null hypothesis, and vice versa. I do not believe that the TV show was a hoax. I expect some scientific studies will be published in the near future. although too many people are too skeptistic nowadays.
A1E6UIC5OWHXH9	1	1	I have purchased several wine openers over the years. All of them had issues, except this one. Easy and fast, this wine opener is everything you want in wine opener without the hassle. Just ensure that you have a full charge before using it!
A1E6UIC5OWHXH9	0	0	I have Windows Vista Ultimate and the software simply doesn't work. I have tried everything including contacting their horrible support (email only). This product has been nothing but a headache. I'm looking to buy Adobe Premiere Elements, hopefully that's better.
A1E6UIC5OWHXH9	0	0	This is a terrible stroller. The canopies do not stay on, the snack trays constantly pop off, the basket doesnt stay closed and everything falls out. Wow, this is very disappointing from Graco and I highly recommend avoiding this one at all costs.
A1E6UVP051XKXQ	1	0	I'll agree with everyone else in that for the first 3/4 of the book, I had no idea where I was headed. And then 'it' happened and the last 1/4 redeemed the entire story.Although the first 3/4 is a bit lacking in action, it contains images of war-torn Europe and wonderful characterizations of the people who lived among the ruins that I will never forget.Begin it, stick with it, and enjoy it.
A1E6UVP051XKXQ	1	1	I did not fall in love with the plot of this book as much as I fell in love with Stern's characters. You will enjoy spending your time with them during the read and will remember them all as if you really got to know them.
A1E6UVP051XKXQ	1	1	The prose is beautiful. That story is incredibly touching, funny, heartbreaking, sad and full of promise. One of the best books I have ever read. Read it - love it.
A1E6UVP051XKXQ	0	0	What a premise! What an idea for a fantastic science-fiction novel! What a terrible story that was written. Instead of focusing on the premise of the story (cloning, morality issues, lack of family, lack of history, the crimes against humanity), Ishiguro focuses on the boring, childish, and uninteresting lives of school children, barely touching upon the premise of the book until more than two-thirds the way through. This was not touching, or intresting, and it really should have been. Ishiguro tried to ring it all in at the end, piling up the "moving" elements of the story, but it was too little to late. Furthermore, he relied upon ridiculous exposition to fill us readers in on how this alternate world came to be. I was equally disappointed with Ishiguro's "When We Were Orphans." This is my last book of his. Read at your own risk.
A1E6UVP051XKXQ	0	0	Loud. Loud. Loud. It does humidify the room effectively, but the noise is just too much to warrant purchasing this product. Oh, and the "night light" illuminates the entire room in a green glow. I thought I was in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' with this thing on.
A1E73ICPEZI0IO	0	0	If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but! Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors? Is anyone that foolish?Oh, and can she possible squeeze "Texas Ranger" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page?Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's.
A1E73ICPEZI0IO	1	1	Kellerman is consistant in his ability to tap into the all too real and disturbing issues of society. All the while, enabling the reader to see the human side of Alex (and Milo-the police lieutenant) desire to understand, if not explain the depravity of societies sickest individuals.The ending was a bit of a surprise in terms of resolution, but the intonation that his relationship with Robin will be reignited leaves me anxiously awaiting his next novel.
A1E73ICPEZI0IO	1	1	I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels. Social stigmas related to accepting 'charity', the cruelty of those with money against those 'without' and the sheer STRENGTH of the human spirit when facing adversity. THis book led me to examine my own reality and realize how fortunate I am to have all that I do.
A1E7S6FRUVL6W7	1	1	Can't compain much about the camera. Its quick to start up and focus, expose, and capture images. Images are great for a point and shoot. There is enough flexiblity to properly expose under difficult conditions too. Sometimes its a little slow to save photos to the memory card though. The redeye function doesn't seem to do much either.
A1E7S6FRUVL6W7	0	1	Although this does the trick (it charges the NiMH batteries), I've used much nicer products that are really not much more expensive.The charger is not "rapid" by any means. It takes more than 10 hours to charge fully. Also, the batteries have to be positioned 'just right' to get the charge lights to stay on. AAA batteries are even harder to get right. Another problem is that batteries much be charged in pairs. Overall, I much prefer the other offerings like the Lenmar Mach 1 charger. Spend the extra money.
A1E7S6FRUVL6W7	1	1	These are the same that I've been buying individually for years. It is nice to stock up and have a years's worth.
A1E7S6FRUVL6W7	0	1	My wife bought this thinking it would be good for the fall party to let the kids bob for apples. To our surprise, after we filled it with water, our kitchen floor was suddenly covered in water! Took us by surprise. Amazon should revise the listing to show that it is not cabable of holding liquids.
A1E7ZM6UDXV203	0	0	I purchased 36 flood lamp bulbs for one of my offices. 14 bulbs failed within 3 weeks. The remaining bulbs lost their light quality within a few weeks, and I was forced to replace them. Neither the manufacturer nor Amazon were willing to refund my money. Under no circumstance do I suggest anyone either purchase these bulbs or deal with this seller!
A1E7ZM6UDXV203	1	1	Very good value. Fits well and looks great. However, three of my buttons broke off even though the vest was lose fitting. Buttons could be replaced with better quality gold metal buttons if you do not mind having a set of non matching buttons and vest. Overall, fantastic value I received several compliments.
A1E7ZM6UDXV203	1	1	I received lots of compliments. These look great with white as well as pastel colored cuffed shirts. Very elegant in appearance. Though, they seem a bit delicate and are smaller in size than I expected.
A1E82Z6CYR1DI6	0	0	We bought this wheel barrel and by the time it got here in pieces we found it was neither the color we asked for or worth the price. It was sent back by us and we had to pay for shipping and handling inspite of THEM not sending the right wheel barrel! I shouldn't have bought another one there, but since we needed one we did. The wheel was flat on arrival, unfortunately we kept it and by the time I went to use it in the spring, it was flat again. It was too bad for us, and too late. I recommend sending back flat wheels as they are usually defective if they arrive like this. It rusted out the first summer of using it in my small gardens and this was not "industrial use" by anyones measurement. I don't feel this was a good value at all. I wouldn't buy it from them again. I didn't like dealing with ACE and I felt their product was over rated and not at all like the picture they used to sell it. I wouldn't buy from them again.
A1E82Z6CYR1DI6	1	1	I loved it when I saw it and it is well worth the price, I'd have paid more!. It's so easy to use and everyone who has seen it loved the color too, and they notice the taste is better. It's different then the usual chrome, black or white that so many people have in their homes. It's also the best if you enjoy really HOT coffee, this one truly makes the coffee hot and there is no burn or bitter taste. The two hour timer for shut off is perfect, as perfect as the taste of the coffee this maker creates.It arrived so quickly and I expected a wait but what a nice surprise when it arrived within a few days and I didn't pay for quick shipping either. The ease of use is dummy proof and the coffee tasted better then any of the other coffee makers I have ever bought in the past, and at my age I have bought a lot of coffee makers! I've had expensive coffee makers and cheap coffee makers and bought every brand out there, this one is the best for the money I have ever purchased. I highly recommend it to anyone. I would have paid more.
A1E82Z6CYR1DI6	1	1	This is the second Cuisinart coffee brewer I purchased. Some years ago I purchased a Cuisinart and it lasted and made the best coffee we ever tasted. I've tried them all, literally. You can spend more money but why when you can make the best and the hottest coffee for less. As much as we use this, it's endurance and consistancy in flavor, heat retention and durablility beats the rest at any price. It comes in an attractive black no finger print container, and can be programmed for having coffee any time. It shuts itself off so no worries. This was also rated by Consumers Best Buy for 2009 (again). The ony thing I would change is it's water tank has no way to let you know how much water is in the container as there is no window for viewing water once you put in it. Other then this small issue ( I measure it with a measuring cup), it's the best coffee pot I ever had and in the future if it wears out, I'll buy it again. It has a one year warrenty, but last me 5 with continuous use daily.
A1E82Z6CYR1DI6	1	1	Mine arrived faster then I thought it would, and I loved the sound. They sounded just like it stated on line. It's very well made, not cheaply strung and easy to hang. Worth the money, in fact given what I paid for others, this one is solid, strong wood and strings, sounds like a church, only better..Worth the money and probably will last longer them many I've had in the past. Thick well made tubes, better wood then most.
A1E842BSM0DCRQ	1	1	Haven't tried all the songs in this book yet, but most seem to quite playable and sound true to the recorded versions. Lots of fun!
A1E842BSM0DCRQ	0	0	Pros: RPN; allowed on the PE examCons: Pretty much everything elseI bought an HP 48S in the early 90's when I began college, and still use it every day at my job as an EE for an electric utility (RPN is so addictive that I even have to use it to balance my checkbook). However, the older HP's are not allowed on the PE exam, hence my purchase of the 35S. To coin a phrase, HP calculators ain't what they used to be.I was hoping for a least a few similarities between this model and my beloved 48S, but I have yet find many. Entry and manipulation of complex numbers is nowhere near the same and their display is somewhat confusing in polar mode. The stack behaves differently as far as the ENTER key is concerned. Even removing the unit from the packaging was a pain (literally). And don't even get me started on the lack of a printed manual.I could go on, but you get the idea. After the PE exam (if I pass), this calculator will become a $50 paperweight. Meanwhile, they'll take my 48S away when they pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
A1E842BSM0DCRQ	1	1	Pros: solidly built (not cheap plastic), good audio, plenty of memory, excellent display, very sensitive.Cons: Poorly written manual, included programming cable is serial instead of USB, no software included.Other thoughts: Don't even think of programming this unit manually (Freescan works fine and costs nothing, just search the web for it). Programming and even using this scanner may present a bit of a learning curve for some, so be prepared to do some homework.Bottom line: This is a great product that is a lot of fun to own.
A1E842BSM0DCRQ	1	1	Pros: RPN, nice keyboard, powerfulCons: Terrible manual, flaky connectivity softwareBottom line: Best calculator out there for engineers (but be warned it is NOT allowed for either the FE or PE exams). More support from HP would be welcomed, as the documentation needs a complete re-write, and the pc link software needs updating. More apps would also be nice, but creating your own is not too difficult once you get the information required to create them.
A1E8CWT6R5GGEJ	0	0	After reading a review (not on Amazon), I had great hopes for this game. Those hopes were dashed with the failure of the software. There was no way to lift the board on the porch if you did not follow the correct sequence of the game. Even going back to a saved game did not help as I was unsure how far back to go. Also in the hallway, my character failed to go into a room as I did not get the sequence right again. This game was deleted from my system, UNFINISHED, which irritates me after spending almost $30 for it. But the biggest let down was the failure of anyone at their website to take responsibility to answer my emails for help. With the varied game interfaces available today, this type of mess is exactly why people are going to other video options. So my advice Dreamcatcher is get it together and produce quality games. I cannot believe that your beta testers let this one off the bench. For the money, Sierra was the best and I still own many of their games because with all the new technology, they still rule. If anyone wants to play some great games get Shivers 1 & 2, Lighthouse:The Dark Being, Torrin's Passage and Rama. They play as good now as they did about 10yrs ago.
A1E8CWT6R5GGEJ	1	1	I also modify the recipe but then I modify most recipes. However, I love this product for it's versatility. Chocolate chip cookies, yep; Surprise Jelly muffins, that too; Brownies, you bet; crepes, oh my what a hit with the family; yeast rolls and so much more. I order this on the Subscribe & Save and am glad they offered it. When I need buns I make my pancakes a little thicker and use them as bread. My family say they like the Surprise Muffins best then pancakes and they love pancakes any time of day.
A1E8CWT6R5GGEJ	1	1	My little purse is about 3 x 4 and 2in wide. It holds everything my swiss army knife, my mini ink pen, change, my little pill box and folds out to carry paper but I did not have a flashlight. I was mostly joking/moaning about this as I told my husband, &#34;if anything happens at night, I am totally unprepared and the light from my cell only last a few seconds. So imagine my &#34;thrill&#34; on Valentine's day when this little sweetie was attached to my card and flowers. It is wonderful and fits in the zipper part of my purse with everything else. I am totally prepared now. I had gotten him the Mega Man flashlight for Christmas and though I cannot bash anyone over the head with mine. This pen light is powerful enough to blind them for a bit...lol. What a great gift idea for anyone.
A1E8CWT6R5GGEJ	1	1	I enjoyed all of these movies but Betty Lou is just what most women feel like at times. Glossed over and subhuman. She did the part very well but the best scene is in the bathroom. What a hoot! Gross Anatomy and Betsy's Wedding are fun films too but Betty Lou does rock.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	I loved this movie. I was skeptical at first of the storyline, but it's based on a true story and it definitely was worth watching. I would recommend.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	They are very pretty and durable. Nice heavy mat and they don't slide like the cheaper ones have done. I would buy them again.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	This matches the seat covers and mats that I bought for my car. The colors are vibrant and go very well. Very nice and durable.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	I saw this when it came out, back on VHS. It was awesome. It was one of the best horror movies I had ever seen. I'm a true horror fan and to this day I still remember this as a true classic. I have watched the current version and this one is still the best. I would definitely recommend, but it's not for the faint of heart. The story is unique in the fact that it follows through on every aspect. No loose ends and there isn't anything you don't understand. It's a true must see and classic for a horror fan. It's not the gore that grabs you, since it's not that bad (I've seen more and worse), it's the character and events that unfold. You have to watch it to appreciate it. Reviews won't give you the full impact.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	0	0	I was hoping for more from this, but didn't get it. You would have to realize that what you see isn't always what is truly happening. It altered realities. Some of it didn't make much sense, but the end brought it together. Peace and compassion were the ultimate goal, yet it did everything in opposite respect to what they wanted to achieve. That part of the story was good, but that's about all I can recommend of it. Just wasn't for a hard core horror fan, so if you like the lighter side this is perfect for you.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	0	1	You will need a good ear to listen since they are foreign and it shows. It didn't quite come together until a little late in the movie. It wasn't really explained what happened or why. The &#34;zombies&#34; weren't typical, but what is in a horror movie? I can't say that it was that good. I liked it well enough to finish it, but the potential for a much better movie was there. The ending was right on target, but left you hanging just a tad. I've seen better, but I've seen worse. You will have to decide if it was worth watching or not.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	I read this because it was recommended to me. I'm in a relationship that is on the verge of ending. I was hoping for something to help me fix it or at least give me a way to cope. This book was astounding. I intend to try speaking my spouses love language, if I can change our relationship it might save us from losing a 6 yr relationship. I intend to recommend this to all of my friends. You never know who it might help. Fantastic book and highly recommend for everyone. Enjoy.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	Well, I'm a huge horror fan, and this one was different. I have to say that once it became clear what was going on, the idea behind the script was pretty unique and I liked it. It's definitely one you have to watch to appreciate. I've watched many zombie movies, but this is one of the better scripted ones. The idea was unique and played out very well. I don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't give details. I'm glad the ending was decent, that is usually where a movie loses me to liking it. It's priced right and not bad, so I would recommend.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	I was looking for this to be a &#34;fun&#34; zombie movie. It was actually. You had your laughs, your scares and your gore. So, to sum it up I am glad I bought it. The ending wasn't as good as it had potential to be, but that's a minor point. I would recommend just because the actors were fun and light. There is plenty of action and gore, so it balanced well enough. Better than expected.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	0	0	I bought this for my granddaughter. She likes it well enough, but I think the DVD is damaged. She had torn the paper cover it came in, so I don't think I can return it. It has issues playing and will &#34;pixelate&#34; as I call it. That's where you can visibly see the &#34;blocks&#34; in the screen and it lightly freezes randomly. I'm disappointed with the quality of this movie. I would use &#34;buyer beware&#34; when buying from this seller.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	0	1	This review is NOT for what is pictured. What I ordered is the purple bottle picture you see, but what I got is something entirely different. The product I received is in a different bottle and it's light blue. It's a toner though. The one I did receive doesn't work well with sensitive skin. It burns and leaves red patches. I had used a retinol product recently and it caused that reaction I'm sure, but since my other toner didn't I can only assume this one isn't as non harsh as others. I typically give excellent reviews for H2O products, but because of what I received I can't do it this time. Order only from a certified seller of H2O, that's my best advice.
A1E8HIVNGUM53A	1	1	I like Jude Deveraux and have read many of her books. This one was very good. I liked the mianstream story, it brought to life the characters and you felt for them. The ending was perfect. I won't be a &#34;spoiler&#34;, but it was different and engaging. It brings home the adage &#34;don't judge a person until you've walked in their shoes&#34;. I liked the &#34;lesson&#34; to be learned from this and it was pure fantasy for an ending, but that just made it better. Nice read for romance, drama, and fantasy readers.
A1E8QG9KDGHD23	0	0	I also reviewed Uglies, and like most people, I went ahead and read the sequel largely based on the concept of the plot. I thought the original plot was inventive and imagination even though Westerfeld couldn't deliver on the writing. It doesn't get much better with Pretties.Some things did improve. I thought there was a lot more action in the first half of Pretties. In Uglies, nothing happens for half the book until Tally runs away. Westerfeld was able to rely on all the new things that would be in Tally's world after becoming pretty, and what that world was like. The Smoke plotline also makes its appearance much earlier, which was smart.The secondary and tertiary characters are also given more personality. Shay is better developed this time around (and probably the only redeemable main character) and newcomer Zane is more fleshed out than David had been - his motivations and romance with Tally make much more sense than David's did.I also liked that Westerfeld seemed more comfortable in his universe. I'm not sure whether it was intentional or not (it would have been pretty clever if it was), but I liked how everyone is meant to be turned into beautiful ideals that everyone wants to be, but while reading I only got the impression that the people, their looks and their world, was all nightmarish and distorted. Instead of feeling like I was in a fantasy world full of beautiful people, I felt like they were monsters, inhuman even, frightening, wrong. I didn't like, though, that there is never a description of what new pretty Tally looks like, so even though there is lip service paid to her being beautiful mostly my mental image of her stayed ugly. He spent so much time in the last book describing Tally's looks and what made her ugly and didn't make a single description of what she now looked like and how she was beautiful. Maybe that was intentional, but since Westerfeld doesn't strike me as particularly shrewd through his writing, I doubt it.Despite these improvements, the writing was still just too unavoidably problematic. Westerfeld still has a problem with vagueness, leaving everything feeling foggy. He still spends unnecessary detail on minute processes like hoverboarding - the whole thing with burning off the cuffs could not have lasted longer. The world still doesn't feel fully formed, with flexible rules that make the laws of the universe seem cheap. You can't decide on a whim what is and isn't possible - that's too easy and lazy.It was also really, really unfortunate that the word "bubbly" appeared so many times. I get that it was a "thing" to go along with the whole pretty universe, but, synonyms exist for a reason even if you are trying to get across some new, made up concept. Pretty-making and nervous-making and spinning and brain-missing - none of these things worked, the effort wasn't that high for constructing his "pretty language." I could say that the all-encompassing, inclusive nature of the terms they used (turning complicated concepts or feelings into simplified offhand by sticking a -making or -missing on the end of it) was supposed to be indicative of how simple-minded you become when you are pretty and brain damaged, but again, the overall quality of Westerfeld's writing makes me hesitant to give him credit for that. It really does just seem like he couldn't come up with anything better, even if that was what he was trying to convey.I also don't understand why, in a world allegedly centuries into the future, for some reason mankind regresses to tribal primitivism. Why are short cavemen in this unidentified area of forest that is for some reason near the island where it was totally never indicated that that's where this story was taking place? Suddenly they're on an island? How does that even work? What island is near a city that used to have a population of hundreds of millions? It's like he didn't even try. I guess he figured well kids are stupid they'll never know the difference. He didn't even try to use any sort of geographical accuracy. They might as well be on a different planet to be honest (but we know they aren't, since the previous book referenced the Mojave desert).And speaking of which, while, in general, I mostly agree with Westerfeld's politics - environmentalism, pacifism, atheism etc - I could definitely see how it would be insulting and condescending to those who don't. He so matter of factly calls gods old-timey "superheroes in the sky." That's gotta be pretty unnecessarily jarring for a 12 year old who believes in god to see, just thrown out there like that.Anyway, by the time I got to the part of the story where the random cavemen think this beautifully crafted young girl is a real God and treat her with deferential reverence, I just hung it up. What, exactly, are you trying to say here, dude? I don't think he even knows.This series was maybe just a ploy to create popular books rather than tell a story he really cared about. Because if he had, he could have taken a great idea (and the ideas behind these books are pretty good) and crafted something really good to go with it. Or maybe he did and he just doesn't have the writing chops to pull it off. In either case, this book just left me with the impression that he wasn't smart enough.
A1E8QG9KDGHD23	1	1	Ok, so I've read both Something Borrowed, and Something Blue, in the appropriate chronological order. While it may be conventional wisdom to side with mousy do gooder low self esteem having Rachel, I find Darcy to be a much more compelling and winning protagonist. I really rooted for Darcy where I spent the whole of Something Borrowed resenting and rooting against Rachel, maybe even hoping for her comeuppance. I just couldn't get behind the idea of this miserable loser making the immoral choice and winning in the end - which surprised me, personally, because normally we always cheer for the underdog.This is why Giffin did an amazing job in both circumstances - she made both the underdog and the top dog relatable regardless of whichever way the reader might tend to lean in her real life. Although there are moments where you do resent Darcy for being so gosh-darn lucky in life (a rich, handsome British doctor immediately falls in love with this HUGELY PREGNANT woman and has no qualms taking over and playing stepdaddy to some other man's twins - COME ON) and ultimately still getting her happy ending, she is still hugely sympathetic. Besides, Darcy is simply more likeable. Even in Something Borrowed, I never hated Darcy like I think I was supposed to; she was never villainous to me. Yes she is thoughtless and self-absorbed, but in my opinion she is the better person. She is flawed, but she is not hateful. She grows and evolves. You simply have more respect for her. She has high self-esteem, she goes after what she wants in life, she's not meek or timid or pathetic. That is how you approach life - you gotta grab it by the you-know-what, even if you have to suffer the consequences from time to time. In my world, that makes her a better heroine; the best ones spiral and fall from grace in my opinion.I loved the back story on Darcy and Marcus's affair, even though you can see it is doomed from the start. I actually like Marcus a lot as a character too (not necessarily going so far as that I preferred him over Dex [maybe] but, again, I think Giffin does a great job of contrasting the two while avoiding making one more of a villain than the other) and was a little disappointed with his trajectory in this saga. This is a testament to Giffin's ability to show the good and the bad in her characters, making them rounded, human. Unfortunately, there are a lot of writers out there that aren't good at getting inside their own characters' heads. You don't understand them, you don't know why they are doing what they do, they don't make sense. Giffin is great at getting at and even under her characters' motivation (particularly Darcy). It's always great when books help you to understand a type of person that you didn't "get" before.I also love that a lot of the suspicions in the previous novel are confirmed in this one. There is an underlying question of how competitive Rachel and Darcy's friendship is, and if, had the tables been turned and Rachel was the one with the great fianc&eacute;, Darcy would have kept her hands off (hence justifying Rachel's affair). It was really smooth of Giffin to show that no, she wouldn't have - Darcy couldn't even allow Rachel to have a boyfriend even when she herself was engaged, which sneaks under the radar (never directly addressed) as Darcy's likely underlying motivation for choosing Marcus to cheat with. When you think about it, it doesn't really make sense otherwise that she would have even done it to begin with. Well played.While it kind of sucked that Darcy had to be exiled from her former life and got the less glamorous ending of the two, I suspect that that had to be done to pacify those that would end up resenting Darcy no matter what - like she got the consolation happy ending. I enjoyed Something Blue more, mostly because it didn't make me sick with disgust and disappointment; it was more fun, more funny, a little bit brighter, which I guess goes to show that in the end the pretty one always does win.
A1E8S8XUQ16751	1	1	No real need to comment on the high-def first season. It's swell. However, it took me three times to get a copy of the first season that did not arrive with the bluray case shattered. I finally settled on one that came just cracked, and not totally broken. And the first season did not come with the pretty little slip cover, so it won't match season 2 and 3.But if you don't let the minutiae bother you, you will without a doubt enjoy the content!

A1E8UNZYRGXEA6	1	1	Morricone is simply brilliant, and it is never more obvious than here on The Mission.Derivative? Repetitive? Yes, and again, yes (see, that was derivative 'caused I stole from another review, and repetitive 'cause i answered... twice). But that's not only OK, it's almost required! And they told you, too, before you paid a penny! Go ahead, look- it's right there, hiding in plain sight. The rest of the class can wait quietly with their heads down on their desks.Waiting..."Original Soundtrack From The Motion Picture"!!! Come on kids- it's a soundtrack from a film, and films are derivative, and repeat symbolism and, well, just come on! It's a soundtrack to a motion picture, and as such it is among the top soundtracks ever.Yes, and again, yes: it IS among the top soundtracks ever! Why? Simple- it does its job, and it does it well. Without its soundtrack "The Mission" wouldn't be nearly as great a film as it is; it amplifies the emotion and sentiment of each scene while acknowledging the environment and remembering the historical origins of the subject matter, and even seems to keep things moving along (in a film I've sometimes thought could have gone a bit long otherwise).More than anything else, though, the brilliance of this soundtrack strikes when you hear it years after last seeing "The Mission" and suddenly it hits like a flood- all the emotion, how overwhelming these men's obstacles were, how visually stunning the environment was and how graceful death can be... how horrific life can be...All these years later I hear "Gabriel's Oboe" and it just takes my breath away.It's a soundtrack to a motion picture, and as such it is nothing short of brilliance, and Morricone a genius.
A1E8UNZYRGXEA6	1	1	I, uhm, normally listen to Electronica. Really. No, really- Moby, Everything But The Girl, BT. Ska, too. Oh, uhm, ska- think of it as high-speed reggae might sound. So I'm having a little challenge with expressing myself here...Superlatives like "Best Of The Best" don't fit this album or this artist; they don't seem to live up to the performance. I thought maybe "The Best's Best"- the difference is subtle, but too subtle, it's still too... superlative. No, perhaps just "Best".Same problem with genres. Griffith isn't bluegrass, or country, or Americana even. She doesn't fit into any single genre, and yet the more genres listed to describe her the more limiting they become. "Newgrass" works, maybe, but implies bluegrass, and she easily (and unconsciously) transcends that.I discovered Griffith in 92 or 93, and was immediately captivated by the stories she weaves (at BPMs that best some techno music); her voice irritated me for about half a minute before becoming charming and endearing. But most of all I was hooked by her sincerity, and that was new too. "Sincerity" is usually capitalized (if not italicized), tends to ooze forth (Mariah?), and always repels me like a line of "Home Sweet Home" cut-out ducks on the wall. Griffith introduced me to lower-case-s sincerity, the kind that's real, not cloying but simple, and honest. Little "s" sincerity provides the foundation that lets her spin these tales of real everyday life in anywhere USA without spinning into a pit of affectation.It's the little things here, really. Little things, like walking through town 'cause there's nothing else to do, or going to Woolworth's cause that's where there is to go; little things like reminiscing about seeing your first ever real live in person prostitute when you went up to the city last year. And remembering her sympathetically.That's the miracle here, amidst an album about small town America comes the simple, unaffected tale of a prostitute, and it fits - you totally buy it. That's a miracle! Of course, anyone who can sing a song with "Pontchartrain" in the title at 180 BPM is a bit of a miracle anyway...Superlatives? How's this: this album remains the biggest miracle yet from a lady who is, in and of herself, a miracle.(And yep, that's a lower-case "m".)

This is a poorly produced, sub-standard collection of early Cher recordings pretending to be something it's not. The audio quality on this disc is significantly worse that the original albums, the volume is inconsistent and some of the songs are actually edited versions rather than the originals. Even the cover looks, well, weird.For clarity, Amazon.com lists the following as Cher product titled Half Breed (links are to Amazon product page for each):* "Half-Breed": the original 1973 LP (Note that the 1973 original album has a hyphen in its title):Half-Breed* "Half Breed": the 1999 import CD which contains both the "Half-Breed" & "Dark Lady" albums:Half Breed/Dark Lady* "Half Breed": the 1995 budget CD you are looking at now:Half Breed* or the 2007 re-release of the same:Half Breed
A1E8UZCUO8C1N3	1	1	When I bought this I thought that it was a documentary about tree hugging....well it was and it was great. It was about The ELF's rise and fall and it takes you on a trip with non bias information. You get informed from the ELF's point of view and the investigator's point of view. It is a fair and interesting documentary and I would recommenced it. I respect the people and their opinions in this documentary.
A1E8UZCUO8C1N3	1	1	This is a great unique movie. I'm not the type of person to write long reviews, so I'll just keep it short. I think it's good. I would recommend it.

A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	If you love books, this novel is tailor made for you because it involves an unknown novelist in the midst of a frightening turn of events -- someone is determined to burn and destroy every last book this novelist ever wrote. When a young booklover stumbles across one of the only remaining novels, all hell breaks loose, almost literally. In the process of discovering who is burning the books, the young booklover --Daniel Sempere -- also solves one of Barcelona's most twisted and hidden stories. This novel is filled with great characters and the best of them all is Fermin, the booklover's right hand man. He made me laugh out loud more than once. This book is so close to being great that I believe it probably is great in its native tongue. A delight to read.....
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	Here is the story of a man obsessed with a woman, so obsessed that he kidnaps her child with disasterous consequences for all. Simon, the obsessive lover, sets many lives into a fult tilt boogie with his act and opens Anna's eyes as to what part he actually played in her life. The author delves heavily into the idea of ambiguity over and over and mainly, he's talking about the ambiguity of relationships and how differently each one of us sees our own relationships. If you like psychology and philosophy mixed into a great story with great characters, you won't be disappointed. The writing is first rate; my only qualm is that all the characters' voices sound very similar but that's really a small quibble.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	As I neared the end of this tough-NY girl-who beats dope and finds-her-calling-in-life book, I was absolutely rooting for not just the main character Jo Flannigan but the author as well. She seemed to be setting herself up for a series of books starring Jo as the main character and I thought: "Wow, she's really tied this up nicely and left herself room for other books." But then came the ending and it blew me and the main character out of the water. The book then reminded me of "In The Cut" (good book/horrible movie but good sex scenes). Still, I guess I have to give the author credit for staying pure to her vision -- she didn't take the easy way out that's for sure. This book is for those who dig a cool New York mentality from the 1950s and that appeals to me, absolutely. So Sara, I was with you all the way for the ride but disappointed to have to fall off at the end.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I just wanted to say that upfront because I cannot compare this book to any of his others, something that everyone else loves to do. But I do live in Park Slope, the location of this whimsical novel and so was drawn to the book. Auster is in fact a neighbor though we've never met.In any case, Brooklyn Follies is a book filled with death, cancer, some minor violence, a woman trapped by a cult, a runaway girl and a vindictive gay ex-lover but somehow it all comes off feeling, well, light-hearted. It's very easy to read and full of optimism in spite of the main character's (Nathan Glass) end-of-the-line philosophy of life. It seems Mr. Glass has come to Park Slope to die, having barely survived cancer and a shrewish ex-wife. He couldn't have picked a better place in my opinion and Mr. Auster's as well. Why? Because Park Slope is filled with the kind of characters that people this book, characters of the Brooklyn variety. Well-educated types who sit around, gain weight and find themselves underemployed. Beautiful women who, because of their accents and provincialism, find themselves working in coffee shops or sitting around making jewelery while their husbands are off screwing their co-workers. There's always something happening in Park Slope which is every bit a small town as anything smalltown USA can throw out there -- no doubt a better one. Into this bizarro universe drops Nathan Glass who discovers that his end of the line choice is anything but. It's full of life and he gets pulled in over and over again. His zany adventures prompt him to take a second, third and fourth look at what he's up to and he emerges a happy man -- on the morning of September 11, 2001. It's a delicious ending to a delicious book. Enjoy.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	...and I love women who curse so this is a winning combination all the way around for me. I'm not sure even the author understands the power "Fear of Flying" had on males as well as females. I read it when I was 18 years old and I still consider it one of the best books I've ever read. As for this memoir of sorts...well, it is disjointed, as critics have charged, but I loved reading the interesting story of Erica's life even though it's piecemeal and in one anecdote after another. It's all connected in the author's mind but not enough for the casual reader. Still, you've got to give her major points for honesty and admitting regret. Loved it but probably only for diehard Erica fans.[For more information about me, visit my website www.paullarosa.com]
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I was watching a Yankee game recently and the broadcaster was commenting on how Derek Jeter hit a particular pitcher so well. The broadcaster, a former ballplayer, said: "Some guys just throw your speed."That's how I feel about Melissa Bank -- she just throws my speed and everything she writes just makes me shake my head in wonder. I think she's a terrifically talented and witty writer and her sentences are not only superb but they make me laugh out loud. Here's one example. The main character Sophie Applebaum is visiting her mean old grandmother who's never said a nice word to anyone and here's what Banks writes: "I was surprised by how old she looked, but the sight of her was nothing compared to the sound. She said, 'Come on in, honey bun,' with so much affection I turned around to see if there was a honey bun behind me."Now that's great, doncha think?If you do, read this book....I found it sad, funny, wise and so well-written.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	0	0	This book falls into a category I call "overpraised and underwhelmed" and I'm the one underwhelmed. To call this book a "page turner" is a joke. I found it tedious in the extreme, the story incredibly boring. I kept hoping that something would happen on one of the pages to justify sticking with it but nothing ever does. The main characters have twisted interior logic, even for clones. No one fights back, very little is explained. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry Kazuo.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	It brought it all home for me, the man's genius and his poetry. I thought it was a very effective way to tell the story, mixing in a long interview with Cohen along with concert footage of his musical fans performing his best songs with verve and enthusiasm. This movie has a lot of style too and is well thought out. I loved it. And it has the coolest moment of the year in film when, at the end, Cohen finally stands up and groans out one of his own songs....then the camera pulls back and his backup band is U2. A great moment! Terrific movie.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	This is the story of two 70s radicals who caused a death and went underground, separating from each other and living for decades in alienation. In the end, it is a sad story of losing life for the sake of an ideal which, in the end, changes nothing. But I guess that point of view depends on your perspective. In any event, the writing is crisp and the author takes many chances, shaking up the sequence of events seemingly any way she chooses. That approach makes the book much better than it would have been as a straight narrative. I was drawn in, both by the writing and the characters and the hope for a reunion. Very cool book.
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	...it's disturbing on many levels. Not only because in New York one minute you can be walking down the street thinking about the cookies you just bought and the next you're kidnapped by gun-toting thugs but also because it's scary to know that people who think so little of life and the law are living very close by. As a die-hard native New YOrker, believe me when I tell you I've come across many many people just like the thugs Alpert runs across in his book. I totally understand where Alpert is coming from. Yeah, while he's kidnapped, he thinks constantly about leaving New York but no surprise -- he's still living here. Me too, even though I know how dangerous and unpredictable this place can be. The tourists don't know the half of it; if they did, they'd never come. But it's a fascinating book...partly because it confirms my worst fears.Tacoma Confidential: A True Story of Murder, Suicide, and a Police Chief's Secret Life (48 Hours Mystery)Nightmare in Napa: The Wine Country Murders (48 Hours Mystery)
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I'll admit that it took me a while to adjust to the British-ness of this book but, once I did, it was a pleasure. The characters are well-drawn and, sadly, too true to life, failing to see what's right in front of them until it's too late. A photograph leads the husband of a dead woman to investigate her past and he and others in her immediate circle discover much more than any of them ever thought they would. They finally understand Kath in death much better than they ever did in life...and discover themselves along the way. It's not a safe or pleasant journey for the characters but, for the readers, it's well worth it.P.S. Revealing the main character as being dead is a plot point throughout the book and does not spoil anything, in case you were wondering. Highly suggested!
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I admit that I was hesitant to read this latest tome by Ann, simply because I am so familiar with the tale of Dr. Bart Corbin. But I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did because Ann reached for and acheived a deep level of humanity for the victims of Corbin who deserves everything he gets and more. Why oh why can't some men simply divorce their wives instead of resorting to murder? Some might quibble and wonder if this is the best work Ann has done. I don't know but she's done so much good work throughout her long career, it seems a moot point. Nice job!

A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I have to join my voice to the chorus of those who found this novel very entertaining. It's all about a woman named Dora who is in the throes of an emotional crisis and, as she has all her life, she finds solace in books -- lots and lots of books (and plenty of wine). Even the boyfriend she takes up with is found at a bookstore and works at the bookstore. As it turns out, he's not the perfect read but neither is Dora who is full of her own emotonal pitfalls. She sometimes reminded me of the female equivalent of the character Larry David plays on "Curb Your Enthusiasm." But do I love Dora? Yes.This book is so well-written and witty it's hard to believe it was written by two authors. They fill their novel with funny quotes about books and a guide to the books mentioned at the end. A book lover's fantasy, this book is.Shameless plug time:Tacoma Confidential: A True Story of Murder, Suicide, and a Police Chief's Secret Life (48 Hours Mystery)Nightmare in Napa: The Wine Country Murders (48 Hours Mystery)
A1E8Z2306YT8ET	1	1	I won't rehash the plot of this novel which has been done here over and over. I'll merely say that it's not written in a conventional way but that's what is so special about it. The book can be confusing and challenging to read but at the end, you'll be glad you did because it's a work of art in the best sense. It's different, creative and thought-provoking. So what if it's not easy to read? You will find yourself, like I did, flipping the pages quickly at the end to find out what happens. It's a love story with a great ending. Make up your own mind.
A1E9659YKDSK0H	1	1	David Wilkerson was a man of God. He heard from the Holy Spirit and fearlessly proclaimed God's Word against the sin and frivolousness of today's church. His book "The Jesus Person Pocket Promise Book" is a handbook of God's promises for all life's situations. Jesus said "man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the Mouth of God". If you are a person washed in the Blood of Jesus Christ, take these promises to the Throne of God and allow God to do His Work in your life IN HIS TIME. We need to learn how to rest in God's Promises. This book will definitely be a blessing to you.
A1E9659YKDSK0H	1	1	Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature is a masterpiece for serious Bible students. It could be used by the regular student of the Bible as well as the one who is in Seminary. The only thing is that you need to know the Greek alphabets and know how to read basic greek. I use this dictionary quite often, during my studies. Iam not a seminary student, but do learn the Bible. In a couple of days I did a quick study of the basic greek alphabets, know how to read words and sentences in greek, (though I cant understand) and that's all you need to know to use this lexicon. For each word, it gives the different meanings according to the context in which it is used. I believe each and every word in the Bible has depth, when used in context. This definitely is an awesome tool for the serious learner of the Word of God. God bless.
A1E9659YKDSK0H	1	1	Edward Mckendree Bounds (1835-1913) was a man of God, born in Missouri, USA. He had a solid experience in prayer and communion with God. This is very much evident in this awesome book. This book is a must for every Christian who loves the Lord and love Holiness. This is not a teaching tool nor it does give you a formula to prayer, for none of that kind of thing exist. The Lord Himself should be our Teacher and Master. Once Jesus prayed at a certain place and a certain disciple came and asked Him. "Lord teach us to pray". This is one of the best, we could ask of God. TEACH US TO PRAY!!! No man could teach us how to pray, except God. The Spirit of God, Himself should be allowed to pray through us, so the Father may hear our prayer. We should learn how to be a vessel, a channel for God's Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit) to flow through us. That's why the Lord said "he that believeth in Me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water". Oh if we could just lean our entire weight on Him and learn to trust in Him...This book is a MUST for any sincere Christian. This book will definitely be a Sign-Post pointing the Way. If God could use these saints of old, He could use us too in this age, for there is a huge need of real men and women of God who will remain faithful, fight and endure to the end. That devil is like a roaring lion trying his best to destroy praying people. Prayer is the most difficult duty in the whole world. Remember, God is always looking for someone who will stand in the gap. (Ezekiel 22:30) Let HIM find us.
A1E9IVN4R6V7M2	1	1	This is an uplifting, life affirming, and relationship empowering humanexperience story. Has quality acting, impactive dialogue,great humor.You will be heart warmed at the end and will find yourself singing .."this little light of mine....I'm gonna let it shine" for days afterward.Positively....contagious.
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	1	1	Sadly even the very band thought that this album was a bad move. Contrary to some of their fans and even the band itself this album was actually very good. The only problem was the lack of radio friendly songs or anything like Hanging By A Moment. But with that said this album did what it was supposed to do and it was to show maturity and a different sound.1. Spin-Very good song, only thing I don't like is the ending but for some fans they may actually enjoy it. That or it could have been shorter, but even then it's still fairly good.2. Wash-Not one of my favorites but something that is still listenable. It has a different feeling from the other songs. Still interesting and worth listening to.3. Sky Is Falling-Very nice song. One of the happier songs on the album and more upbeat as well.4. Anchor-While I particularly don't like like it or couldn't get into it, it at least gives the album a song for those who are looking for a song that utilizes that "Rock" sound from an electric guitar. If any song sounds "hard" it would be this one5. Am I Ever Gonna Find Out-Seems to be missing an intro, sort of just jumps into the song but it's actually very good considering what the song before it does to you. Also one of the more upbeat awake songs.6. Stanley Climbfall-This song is best appreciated when in a quiet place in the dark. The way it starts it's so calm and sort of just takes you into another world, definitely one of those songs that just moves you inside7. Out Of Breath-If you liked "Hanging By A Moment" then you'll like this song. They should've released this song instead as a single, it might've done better than "Spin" radiowise.8. Just Another Breath-If you liked "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out" you're gonna like this one too. Also one of those upbeat songs.9. Take Me Away-this one was by far the best one for the radio. Had this song been released 1st and a good video with it the album would've done better. It does what "Anchor" was supposed to do in terms of having the "rock" sound of the guitar along with that moving feeling of "Stanley Climbfall".10. My Precious-certainly a different sound but makes you feel like you're slowly walking in a cave. However somebody else may like the feeling it gives and it at least stands out in a way from the other songs.11. Empty Space-a surprisingly more sort of happy song. while not a favorite of mine, it is perfect for setting up for the next song12. The Beginning-ironically this is put at the end but it is one of those songs that you can just imagine people uniting together and sort of just creating peace. Where in "No Name Face" "Everything" ended it with an emotional song(not complaining), The Beginning gives it a nice happy ending feel to the album.If you have the special edition of this album theres two more tracks13. How Long-this should've been in the original album and it could've easily replaced "Anchor", "Empty Space", "My Precious" or "Wash" for that matter easily. If you liked the feel you get from songs like "Stanley Climbfall" then you'll like this one for sure.14. Sky Is Falling(acoustic). nothing more to be said. a nice acoustic version of it.It's really not a bad album and had there been different songs released as singles and had it had better promotion the album could have done well. It does what the album needed to do which was to show maturity and give a different sound rather than do the same thing as the No Name Face. If anything, the real disappointments are their self titled album "Lifehouse" and "Who We Are" which both lack the emotion, arrangements, and the almost spiritual feeling you get from "No Name Face" and "Stanley Climbfall"
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	0	0	I got this album about 6 to 7 years ago and I initially didn't like it. I thought it was because the good songs were the radio singles and the rest were fillers or that maybe I had to give some songs some time to sink in. Well nope.In the last two years since I started playing two instruments I've learned to appreciate real songs and how they're put together and looking back at this album it's still crap. I expected to hear songs with background music along the lines of say my name, independent woman pt 2, or from the last destiny's child album, cater 2 u, lose my breath, etc but the radio singles and the other songs on the album are like day and night. The main problem is the background music on the other songs are very bland and lack any real arrangements or diversity in instruments used in the songs. Also there were too many slow songs and not enough faster more upbeat songs and even the slow songs lacked life.If you really want to know whether to buy the cd or not. Go on youtube and listen to the songs there and if you like them then buy the album.
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	1	1	Okay some reviewers said that the album isn't as good as their other material or that it's too different but that's how it's supposed to be. Each now album is supposed to be better or as good as the one below, and the formula is supposed to be tweaked enough to not become repetitive. (If you haven't figured it out by now, this is their first album).With that said this is not a bad album actually. It's fairly easy to listen to, and the best way to describe it is like the DJLN(Donde Jugaran Los Ninos) album but with the rock factor toned down. I would actually say the DJLN is their first real rock album.If you have DJLN, CLAL, SL and their RDA albums then there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the songs on this album.
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	0	0	When I bought this product, or at least the one I got in the store, it was pretty much made for those who wanted to record guitars(though I bought it to record on the keyboard but that's besides the point).Well what would you know, 1st the CD itself gave my drive a hard time. At times I felt like my CD drive on my computer would stop working altogether(The 2nd time I installed it I made a cd image and then installed it using a virtual drive to easy up on the cd drive). Then in installing it apparently some driver couldn't install. After installing and uninstalling I still never got it to install.Then when I did try to record my guitar, I could barely hear the signal. It's ridiculous how there are different effects for the guitar but yet you can't hear jack isht. Keep in mind the volume on my computer was all the way up and so were the speakers that i had connected to it. The main thing it was for, for recording the guitar and this isht wasn't even good for that. At most it at least gets rid of static so if you want to record a guitar or your voice, you're on your own. If you are like me and want to record yourself on the keyboard, get a piano/keyboard vst plugin and you'll be better off.The hardware itself wasn't great, the software itself isn't either and even the process of installing it is a pain(yes even physically to your cd drive, seems like it's about to break something off any time soon).
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	1	0	As others may have mentioned already, Reyli(the singer from the first two albums) went solo so the band had to replace the vocalist.With that said, the songs are what you'd expect of Elefante so if you liked the style of the first two albums, you'll probably like this one as well. And don't get me wrong, the new vocalist can sing and all, but for me it just isn't the same as if it was Reyli doing the singing. The songs are good though, but for me it just isn't the same without Reyli. Who knows though, maybe the new voice will grow on me in time.
A1EA90QGLTCHW2	0	0	Do not pay for this lousy book. Trust me I'm pretty sure you can obtain it from "alternative sources" if you know what I mean and I advise this if you HAVE to get it for a class. If it's for your own pleasure then...well don't say I didn't warn you.Now understandably sometimes some concepts of any subject can be hard to absorb the first time and you have to re read the portion a couple of times to get what's going on. However it does not make sense to present examples of something like a certain notation and then explain later how it works. To give you an idea of the phuckery you'll find, Katz first tells you in chapter 1 that 23,37 in babylonian notation is 1417 in our notation but doesn't tell you until later that their base is 60, and basically you have to figure it out on your own that you have to multiply 23 by 60 and then add 37 to get 1417. Honestly this is like saying tan(x)*cos(x) = sin(x) and then telling you that tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x). While no hard content can ever be made easy, content that is already hard to learn will certainly become much harder than it already is when it's written by an incompetent writer.This is just the beginning though as the third edition isn't much better either. Infact on one of the EXACT exercises that were recycled into the 3rd edition, there's a mistake there saying "measure the distance AS along a line perpendicular to AS" when in the 2nd edition it says "measure the distance AC along a line perpendicular to AS" in an exercise from chapter 2. Don't say I didn't warn you.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	0	I am quite impressed with this GPS. I have Honda's nav system on my 2007 Accord and this Garmin unit is just as good as the built-ins.Reasons I like this unit:1) Size - The unit is small which is great for putting it away when car is parked and unoccupied, and it's small enough to carry in a purse if desired.2) Touch screen - easy to use, quick response to commands.3) Basic - you don't have to pay for "bells and whistles" features such as Bluetooth, which is not something really required for a nav system.4) Price - what else can I say, the price of this unit is fantastic. It I can pay less than $200 for a unit that gets me from point A to B without getting lost, why do I need to spend in upwards of $400 - $800 for a "fancier" model. THIS GETS YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO and for a lot less.I give this unit 10 stars. It started up right out of the box and was ready to use in a couple minutes and then, viola!, I was on my way...It took me longer to cut my way into the plastic box that the unit is packed in. Why, why, why does this have to be such a hard thing to do. It's like opening a new dvd or cd. :)Don't waste your money on the more expensive GPS systems when this inexpensive unit accomplishes what you are truly looking for in a GPS.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	I'm perplexed by all the negative reviews about the author being self-centered. This is a book about her so of course it's going to be "about her". The author is genuine and honest. I relate to what she went through in her first marriage and I completely understand the need for her to find herself. If all of us could just get up and go to 3 countries in a year...I found the second part of the book to be a bit tough to get through in the beginning but as she started to "get" the meditation for what it is supposed to be, it got a little easier to read.I think any woman who has gone through a not-so-great marriage and then decides to divorce will relate to this book and the author's feelings.I can't wait to read her new book, Committed.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	It's good but I have to pour coffee over the sink because it leaks when pouring into a cup. Brews really fast. I only need a small amount of coffee to make a full pot and it makes 2 cups. I've had this for 6 months and it still brews nice and hot. That's more than I can say for a lot of other pots, esp. Hamilton Beach makers which notoriously quick working after a few months.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	These work but I'm perplexed by the grossness of changing it. Ugh, what a mess. It was easy to insert, not too hard to take out but I keep wondering if it would leak when it was time to change (it did). There are a lot of positive reviews of this item and similar. I think tampons are easier though. This product may take some getting used to. It's definitely harder to deal with when traveling (which I was the first time I tried it). Not something that's easy to change in a public restroom.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	I was surprised at how good this workout is. It's 45 minutes and the time went by really quickly. Baron's style is casual and he doesn't use the typical yoga verbiage which I am accustomed to but all in all a great workout. I am an intermediate yoga practicer and do yoga 3 times a week and I found this video to be a little easy except for the balancing exercises. This compares to Bryan Kest's videos. Both instructors are great. I also do Mark Blanchard's yoga DVDs and find them to be harder and longer. All 3 instructors are worth purchasing to mix it up.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	I'm on my second Cuisinart coffee maker. I've had my current machine for about 14 months. It is slow at brewing coffee although the coffee comes out pretty tasty. The carafe spills every time I pour a cup so I'm constantly cleaning up spilled coffee. Occasionally the coffee is not very hot when it's finished brewing. Overall, and compared to other brands I've tried, this is a decent coffee pot and I would probably replace with the same unless I can find another than doesn't spill when pouring.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	1	Very informative set about the states. Easy to use, easy to choose a particular state within the dvd. This is a well put together compilation of history of each of the US states.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	0	0	After using the First Response at the same time I used cheapie internet o tests, I found the First Response DID NOT, DID NOT and I repeat DID NOT give me a positive result on the day that the internet cheapie did AND the RE's office test was positive on the same day too. Seriously? Maybe this brand isn't as sensitive as internet cheapies and the ones the doctors use, but FOR THE PRICE of this item, it should be superior. It's not. It's not. It's not. Completely disappointed. I even did 2 First Response tests and neither was positive.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	0	0	At first this coffee pot seemed to be the answer to my coffee pot issues, it brewed in 5 minutes, coffee was slightly strong, but still decent, the carafe kept the coffee hot all day. Fast forward 4 months of ownership and the pot takes 35 minutes to brew the same amount of water, the coffee is terrible and doesn't stay warm very long.In addition, the lid on this pot is difficult to screw on evenly. If I didn't get it on right, the water would not drain into the pot. Then, one morning I accidently screwed the lid unevenly (a very easy thing to do) and it got stuck to the point where I could not get the lid off. It still won't come off. The entire unit is unusable now. I've had it 4 months. Sure, I can buy a new carafe and a separate lid for $56, but seriously, I am just going to go to Wal Mart and buy a less expensive and simple coffee pot.I'm done with $100 coffee pots, I've tried them all, and they all last less than a year.DON"T BUY THIS ONE. IT'S ONE OF THE WORST I'VE HAD.
A1EABBW7SKXEO3	1	0	After using another product that didn't work quite as I needed it to, I bought the Nature's Miracle to reduce the cat urine smell from an approximately 12" x 12" strip of carpet that kitty urinated on. I pulled the carpet up and drenched the entire area, using 3/4 of the bottle and noticed a strong rubbing alcohol smell. The area was so wet it took about a week to dry, but guess what....no smell. If I put my nose up to the carpet I can still smell the urine, but it doesn't stink up the entire upstairs area of my house like it was doing before the treatment. I plan on doing 1 more treatment in hopes of completely eliminating the odor.
A1EAVDX5VZL1X7	1	1	This book is an absolute must have! I finally feel like I have a real system that is really going to help me become more organized and efficient. And, if you haven't already, check out &#34;The Secret Weapon&#34; online which combines the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD) with the free software Evernote to take this to a whole other level. I'm so glad this book was recommended to me!
A1EAVDX5VZL1X7	0	0	I took a chance on this slipper because of the positive reviews but the leopard/cheetah pattern is really, really tacky in person and the &#34;cushioning&#34;, to me, feels absolutely weird. I returned them because the size I got was too small but I would have been really unhappy to keep them anyway for the above reasons.
A1EAZ1D76TT6EK	1	1	I just love the author's character as it comes through in the book. The book is written sort of like a comic strip, and the info is thought provoking and fascinating, like how to look at the curvature of your fingernails and correlate it with aspects of your health, for instance. Whether it's true or not, you have to figure out. I loved the book because I felt like I was in a beautiful world when I read it. I love the author's sense of humor and odd style.
A1EAZ1D76TT6EK	0	1	Ugh! I can't believe this gets so many positive reviews, ostensibly from people who have dry hair... I have fluffy, dry, fly-away, curly hair. This shampoo sucks! It seems to destroy my hair. The best solution I've found is to use conditioner instead of shampoo, and occasionally use a TINY BIT of a certain weird shampoo from the health food store mixed with straight jojoba oil.If your hair is dry enough for you to be shopping for a "hydrating" shampoo, chances are, you shouldn't be using shampoo at all. It is one of the worst things you can do to fragile hair. I am so angry that I've been using shampoo for so many years, destroying my hair, searching for the "right" shampoo, not realizing that there was no "right" shampoo. Even the new sulfate-free non-shampoo "cleansers" dry the @#$% out of my hair.ANYWAY. Second of all, it is GROSSLY OVER-SCENTED with the most sickening, cloying perfume, and I felt like I was drowning in it in the shower, and when I went to bed my pillow case would reek of it. I used it until it was gone because I had spent so much money on it and I was still convinced that it would help my hair over time.
A1EAZ1D76TT6EK	1	1	she has stumbled on a major key to feeling good. You need to eat greens every day! They are their own food group, not to be lumped into "vegetables"'s group. You can't really eat the greens you need every day, so take a short cut and put them in the blender and drink 'em. That's the point. The book is worth reading because it explains it in depth and gives you ideas. I LOVE THIS BOOK! Yeah, I know there are some weird errors. Irrelevant to the merit of the book.
A1EAZ1D76TT6EK	1	1	This is perfectly good oregano oil. I've never seen bad oregano oil, so I don't know what it'd be like. But this seems perfectly fresh, potent, and effective. Oregano oil is amazing! By the way, a lot of "oregano oil" you can buy is some other oil WITH oregano oil; this is 100% oregano oil, and it's the cheapest source I've found. GOOD PRODUCT!
A1EAZ1D76TT6EK	1	1	This does a good job of what it's supposed to do. I have to write at least 20 words for this review to qualify... I used it to hook up a receiver to a recording device. It fits the jacks and hasn't shorted.

The up dated Sherlock is very much the same man, just given the tools of this day and time. His personal short comings of old are very much with him, but we are given a better look inside the workings of this man. Just Fun.
A1EBCJWBKES7TC	0	1	Very poor story line and killer sex. Some will like this book in fact the Advocate.com said it was a must read. So I did .. just like a low budget porn move it got tiresome quickly. I may pick it up where I left off on some cold rainy night if I am in the mood for it. I use Kindle so there is no problem going back to it.

A1EBFJ5YAPXCAE	1	1	I bought two of these from a local outdoor store, and one fell out of my hunting pack. I hunt 98% of the time on public hunting land, and you better have some type of cover scent or attracting scent. If you have ever had a bottle of estrus doe or doe pee spill in your back back, get on your hands, and even worse the floor board of your truck; I promise you will love the pee-willie wick. The top screws on and off, and it's a glass container which keeps the scent longer. All you have to do is put your favorite scent in the bottle and shack it up to cover the wick. When you go hunting just hang it from a tree, open the top, and un roll the wick.
A1EBJR460PUAGM	0	0	While he may have a nice command of the English language, and certainly shows talent in his imaginitive descriptions, this book is not about the Kalahari Bushmen. It's like the author needed a topic, and chose the bushman, so he could have a legitimate vessel to spew his philosophies and insights into the world. Does he truly care about the bushman? Half the book's story felt like it was just an excuse to talk about how the author is an outstanding person: fair, rational, logical, intuitive, expert marksman, friend, compassionate; then he also goes off for pages that are seemingly dedicated to demonizing one of the expedition's members, it's like Van Der Post was still holding a grudge from their trip, and somehow had to vent his anger and prove to everyone that he was "in the right".I wouldn't recommend this to someone interested in learning more about ancient cultures or the Kalahari bushmen; I also wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a book about adventure. While I'm not unhappy I read this book, I do feel like I could have read something with more substance. What I gained from this book is the experience of having read something I truly didn't care for. You know how people talk about not being able to put a book down? I had a hard time picking this one back up...There's gotta be something better on the subject. This book isn't even that memorable of a spiritual journey; the books by Carlos Castaneda, the first few in the Don Juan series -- this is what I'd recommend for a "spiritual" journey.

A1EBY42ZXFUXQQ	1	1	It is perfect to carry my glock 26 in a pocket holster. I use it in the summer to carry my handgun, extra magazines and sunblock with a high intensity flash light. It needs a shoulder pad but they're relatively easy to obtain.
A1EBY42ZXFUXQQ	1	1	I still haven't read it all but what I have is very relavent. My concealed deadly weapons instructor recommended it and I have to admit it was a wise choice. If you're going to open carry or concealed. the information in the book may be life saving.
A1EBY42ZXFUXQQ	0	0	I gave it away. You have to shread the closet bar through the bag to hang it. Mine are bolted to the wall and I can't do that without a major job. I have several others but they hang from the bar, not around the bar.
A1EBY42ZXFUXQQ	0	1	The grip extensions do the job but they're hollow on the underside. I had hoped it would give a little bit of extra space for the rounds to fit the magazine as well as extend the grip to make the glock 27 have a more stable grip. It gave a better grip but didn't help with the spring tension.
A1EC74M4XBTAWG	1	1	One of Fellini's greatest. Certainly his funniest. Warm, nostalgic, absurd, wonderful, the film observes a small Italian town during the German Occupation. It is humanistic to it's core, knowing and loving. In my top ten. This week, anyway.Ha.
A1EC74M4XBTAWG	1	1	I was 15 when this film was released. It was during a very hot summer in Des Moines that &quot;Zhivago&quot; played at the best equipped cinema in town, the Ingersoll. State of the art projection, sound, etc. I went to the first showing, which was a matinee, and I was only 1 of 5. I left the theatre, after hours of air-conditioning and the Russian steppes, to be blinded by our Midwestern summer. Though my body thawed on the bus ride back home, my heart held fast to the film I had experienced. I went back twice more, and would have gone more times had I been able to afford it.Now, many years later, though I am much more cynical and crabbed with age, I watched the DVD version with the same enchantment, the same romantic urges I had felt so many years before.Just watch it, without a snide side. Allow this wonderful film to fill you with it's sweep and emotions intact. Lean is a cinematic god.
A1EC74M4XBTAWG	0	0	The film is, at best, a terrible waste of Emily Watson's talents.
A1EC74M4XBTAWG	1	1	These five classics of British cinema were the bellwether of cinematic humor to come. That Alec Guiness starred in all five is an indication of his profound abilities. Though the extras on these DVDs consist of the trailer for each film and little else, it is worth it to have pristine copies of these droll, hilarious films.
A1ECGDBF0QRQPX	1	1	All Mountatin tees are beautiful and well made. They are cut on the larger side, leaving them roomy. However that makes it a little difficult to figure out what size you should order on-line. The kids sizes seem to be closer to what you would expect in terms of size. This will be for my daughter's 7th Unicorn themed birthday!

THE ONE FROM "The New Kid" SOUNDTRACK!!! this version is pathetic. i mean, if they go big, horray for them but lets just say i won't be cheering them on next time im in some podunk club downtown.get midtown or NFG if you want to enjoy some REAL punk music.
A1ECNGEBYQ0HL6	0	0	After reading the first 2 books, I really looked forward to the final bookin the series Never Call Retreat. I thought Newt Gingrich had done wellwith Alternate history and its an area we all know it can be hard to pulloff and I thought he had done well with the characters especially withGettysburg. All of a sudden I felt in Never Call Retreat it seemed GeneralGrant comes in with one master plan to defeat Lee not just in one battlebut with one battle that settles the whole war. I felt that Newt Gingrichhad written himself into a corner with the first 2 books and this was theonly way he could write himsself out of it successfully. Everyone knowshow successfull how Lee was in real life and we are introduced to thisin the first book and it continues on into the second book. We don't getthis with General Grant Like a previous reviewer said with him you getomni-potent powers where everything just falls into place for Grant. I was disappointed with this book. If anything I could have seen the thirdbook having a series of inconclusive battles between Grant and Lee thathappened in real life that could have set up a fourth book that ended upat Appomatix. Not a book where it writes Grant has arrived the War is over now. Sorry General Lee but you're really a second rate general nowthat I've arrived, but that is my take.
A1ECNGEBYQ0HL6	1	1	The learning curve is easy overall. The only problem I've seen is smallchildren may have problems kicking a field goal or P.A.T or the K.O. Thistakes some dexterity that a child under six may not have. The game gives arecommended play for each down so very easy to play. I liked it. Animationvery simple.3 stars for animation. 5 stars for fun. Overall a four!
A1ECNGEBYQ0HL6	1	1	A very good critical narrative. He breaks it down each battle The ANV participated in. He gives a good account what each commander starting withBrig Gen Johnston and Brig McDowell at Manassas(Bull Run) ending withAppomattix Courthouse did and how they as commanders could have fought their battle and win. Good insight especially since he was in the commandtent with General Lee and Longstreet. This is what is lacking with mosthistorians now days. He gives very good details but some readers say thereading is dry. This is not a daily journal on a privates war. Read theTitle. It should explain itself. The narrative briefly tells what eachbrigade did if needed to help develop the battle line. He does not getinto each regimental history unless there is a particular point to make. He does break it down What each army brings to battle and casualties. Very important to my thought. Also there are a few snippets here and there to make things funny. One thing In a way before reading this book I bought the other one his personal journal "Fighting For the ConfederacyThe Personal recollections of General Edward Porter Alexander" This is amore personal side of him. It has more personal thoughts and observations on the war and the people he met during the war. I think Iwould have enjoyed The Military Memoirs even more by reading the Personalrecollections first but that is my take. In any event General Alexanderis accurate enought with his information that he can still hold his ownwith modern historians today. Even better he didn't let the "lost cause"mentality interfere with writing the Critical Memoirs.
A1ECNGEBYQ0HL6	1	1	Good songs like you remember them if you are an Idol fan. "Rebel Yell"always a favorite! The only down side I've never been a favorite of liverecordings on CD's tapes etc. They always sound bad. I'm paying to heargood quality music. The live recording is what you expect. Can't carry atune in a bucket haha other than that the rest of the songs are good. -1for the live recording.
A1ECNGEBYQ0HL6	1	1	A very good what if cold war scenario. These are actors that were just getting started. Makes you wonder though why an Airborne unit needs to drop on an out of way place like this town but I suppose its germane to the story.
A1ECU2MIN4UWAT	1	1	This CD is simply one of the best Sinatra CD's I have heard. My husband is the true Sinatra fan, but this one I enjoyed more than any other.
A1ED3AUTQMGY5C	1	1	No one has mentioned this yet, but this album is at least a third Manu Chao (And if you don't know who he is, get his album Proxima Estaci&oacute;n: Esperanza, right now) and while the husband and wife duo of Amadou and Bamako do their usual thing--very Malian sounding (to my ignorant ears perhaps) guitar and soulful vocals--the production and keyboard programming comes courtesy of Senor Chao, which gives the album both a much wider and deeper palette of sounds and rhythms than previous albums by the duo. Manu Chao's singing and musical style is radically different than theirs, but they blend together like rhythm and melody (which would be the most blunt way to describe the difference between them: Chao sing raps, funky and dancing around the beat, while Amadou and Mariam soar and play through the melodic register). The best track, to my mind, is "Coulibaly" with the best of african polyrhythms and guitar playing, though the very Manu Chao-ish "Senegal Fast Food" and "Taxi Bamako" are growing on me.
A1ED3AUTQMGY5C	1	1	This is the most important work ever written on this subject. It's impossible to ever look at the subject of this work in the same way again. We'll never be the same.
A1ED3CRJY3RDOD	1	1	"Bloccstyle" is yet another underground album that's dope as f*ck but probably won't be recognized as great. It came from California in the mid-90's; the glory days of gangster rap, the influence of which made almost all mainstream poser rap what it is today. Doc's debut is a combination of gangster and horrorcore rap, some of the most explicit lyrics and subject matter ever heard on one cd. This is in large part due to Brotha Lynch Hung (Doc's right hand man on this album), and alongside the G-funk flavored production, "Bloccstyle" is in my opinion a bonafide classic. The G-Funk influence is most notable on Da Real Deal, the best song on this cd. Mr. Doctor teams with Lynch as partners in rhyme on many tracks; the two compliment each other well - Lynch sounds crazier, Doc more laid back in their delivery styles. These guys actaully have talent, keep in mind, they can rap in time to the music rather than just babble on mindlessly and off-key about "The Club." Doc and Lynch's gangster flows over smooth, rolling beats make for an album with nothing but cuts. Best songs: Bloccstyle, Fucc Yo Side, No B*tch, 40 oz. and Chronic Dice, Real Deal. Worst song: Treat Em Like H*ez.
A1ED3KX3PEHK8Q	1	1	My husband and I spent a lot of time figuring out what kind of wireless card to get for our IBM ThinkPads. After scouring reviews everywhere, I found that this particular card had received a lot of high marks.We ordered one, figuring that we would see how well it worked, and how difficult the setup was. We got the card, and I let my husband have first go at it. It was easy to set up. Within minutes, he was able to connect to the router. Granted we run Windows 2000, and we followed the installation direction to a T.When it came time for me to install it on my computer, it took longer for me to enter in the data to connect to the router than the install did. Neither my husband nor I had any problems with the install, and even after reformatting my computer a few days ago, it took me no time at all to be back in the wireless love.We live in a 2 floor townhouse, and we have no problems connecting to the router no matter where we are. I can easily use my computer on the screened in porch or in the kitchen. The signal is strong, and I've never had any problems.All in all, don't scrimp and save [a few bucks] by buying another card. This card is worth every penny. After reading the horror stories for other cards, it makes me very happy that I did the research and picked this card from the start.
A1ED3KX3PEHK8Q	1	1	Those who know Nikon's lineup well, will know that this camera falls between the flagship F5 and the high consumer end N80. It has a tough role to fill, and it does it perfectly.The focusing on the F100 is far faster than on the N80. When I originally bought my N80, I thought it was fast. On the F100, it's amazing. The images from the F100 are great, and I've never had one that didn't turn out because of camera error (what can I say, human error is the prevalent error behind this camera)This camera isn't for everyone though. It lacks some of the features of the N80, such as the pop up flash and the grid lines on demand. If you're looking for an introductory camera, this is not it.However, if you're serious about photography and already have a speedlight (flash), then this camera is definitely worth it. The reason for it not including a pop up flash is that the camera is geared towards very serious amateurs or professional photographers. Nikon figures that by the time you step up to one of their higher end cameras like the F100 or the F5, that you've already acquired a good flash unit. To put it into perspective, one of the photographers who routinely shoots at the local high school shoots with this camera. You can get the grid lines in the viewfinder by spending another [amount of money] and replacing the screen inside the viewfinder. Unfortunately, they aren't built in like the N80, but there is a work around, so in my mind, that's not a big deal.This camera also has a vertical grip via the high power pack, which is something that the N80 is clearly lacking. So if you tend to shoot a lot in the vertical direction, this is a definite plus, especially if you're like me and don't have very big hands.All in all, I highly recommend this camera for those who are serious about their photography, and don't want to spend the cash for the F5.
A1ED3KX3PEHK8Q	1	1	I recently purchased this CD based on a recommendation from another website.I went to the artist website, where you can download a full length MP3 of one of the songs on the CD (Frozen, which happens to be one of my favorite tracks). It was enough to get me hooked. I then proceeded to listen to the clips of other songs on her website. All it took was one listen and I had to have it.This CD is not what you'll hear on mainstream radio. But you will hear emotion that is so wonderfully captured. In one instant, you'll think you hear hints of Tori, and in another, you'll know that it's not that. It just has a certain mix that is just its own.
A1ED3KX3PEHK8Q	1	1	I purchased this lens shortly after getting my first SLR camera. While it came with a 28-80mm lens, I found that I wanted something that was faster and that had a little more throw on the long end of things.I've had this lens now for about nine months, and it rarely leaves my camera body. The optics are great, the build is far better than what comes in an SLR kit these days. The only suggestion I can give to a buyer is to get a top of the line UV filter, because otherwise, you will notice degradation of the image quality.This Nikon lens is built well. It has a nice heavy feel that will make you feel better about spending the money on it. I know I love mine. I only wish that Nikon offered a version of this lens with a constant (fast) aperture.
A1ED3TOW2QVSBF	1	1	If one likes to dive into the roots of the human experience as refracted through the eyes of anglia, this is the place to go. I almost always leave refreshed when I visit, and I'm glad to see others enjoying this musical tome.
A1ED3TOW2QVSBF	0	1	Truth is, one hardly knows why Outgrabe decided to take this detour into the land of "bang the drum." Their first and third CDs are filled with very lyrical and moving songs. This CD simply clouts you about the head and shoulders. My impression is that the die-hand Grabies will like it, but I'm rarely in the mood for this sort of thing myself.Note to previous poster: If you want to know what all this fuss is about, take a listen to their third CD, "City of God." That's the one that has all the knickers in a twist.
A1EDAB97X8HFGO	1	1	This is a great musical, with all the trappings of a classic broadway production.....only super low-budget and with the sense of humor of a precocious thirteen year old (that's meant as a compliment). Trey Parker pulls off an ambitious venture surprisingly well. It is also worth owning on DVD because, like Monty Python and other classics of comedy, it's humor remains funny after repeated viewings.Plus, there is a brief cameo by recently deceased God-father of experimental cinema Stan Brakhage!
A1EDAB97X8HFGO	1	1	This book covers virtually every aspect of PC Hardware, for both AMD and Intel based PC systems. The Thompsons continue to update the information to stay current with the latest hardware available as well as throroughly covering older systems. It also includes entire sections on both upgrading your PC (and evaluating what/when to upgrade) and building your new PC from scratch.
A1EDAB97X8HFGO	1	1	This book is a transcript of W. Murch's lecture on the theory and practice of film editing, edited for print and updated to include recent developments in NLE's (Non-linear editing systems).A real eye opener. This was my first contact with Mr. Murch's perspective on film editing and I was blown away. Through psychological theory and a clear and grounded perspective on the practice of editing (developed from years of experience), he explores how we relate the film experience to our real-life experience and why film and film editing work as a compelling and coherent medium. Since reading this book I have passed it on to all of my film maker friends and they have all raved about it. Before you begin another film or video project, READ THIS BOOK.
A1EDAB97X8HFGO	0	0	Like others, I'd like to put a disclaimer up front that BioWare seems like a good company and the people there seem to care about their product.Atari, on the other hand, clearly does not. I am one of the many people who are unable to use this game with my cd drive. I tried everything under the sun (checked that drivers were current, updated firmware, etc.). There is no fix for this on the BioWare or Atari site (as of 7/25/03). I emailed Atari's tech support (after going through their troubleshooting maze) TWO WEEKS AGO and I have received NO RESPONSE.As some(probably most) people's cd drives work with the SecuRom, one could say that it is MY problem that it doesn't work and I should just go out and buy another cd drive so I can play this game.The question is, "Do you want to gamble with your time and money?"Alternate Review:This game is great. Unlike the previous NWN, this expansion revolves around the exciting world of computer troubleshooting and technical support. You play an unwitting dupe of the Atari game distribution company who has been suckered into buying a game that won't run on your computer despite the fact that your system meets the requirements printed on the packaging and that there was no disclosure of the known hardware incompatibility issues. Your pulse will race as you search for new drivers. Your heart will pound as you update the firmware for your cd drive. Will the firmware work? Or will this be the end of your drive? On-line play is great to, as you post to discussion threads and share your frustration with other "users". The high level of realism makes this title "one not to miss".
A1EDCARIU6REOZ	1	1	Needed a quick and easy way to relocate our CEO's home wireless router - didn't want to step into a hornet's nest of trying to run Ethernet cabling through his house. Decided to give this product a go.Out of the box, into the wall jack simple. Yeah - of course there are throughput issues, and yeah, if you live in an apartment complex, you might want to dig a little deeper into the documentation to encrypt your traffic - but for a super easy LAN bridge from one room to another - oh man - technology has never been so easy.Truly "plug & play" :-)
A1EDCARIU6REOZ	1	1	Got one of these from Target years ago. Loved it, so a week later I purchase 2 more.Over the years, I've dropped them, washed them so often in the dishwasher & generally abused them that each vessel is looking rather ragged.I started to get worried when I couldn't find replacements anywhere and I didn't know how to search for them on the Web because there isn't any branding on the vessel nor the screw top lid - no branding, NO WHERE! ZOMG - I was starting to freak out.Then the wife saw a smaller version at a grocery store and purchased it. I entered the product info into my Amazon app on my Android phone and BAM! Two days later ... Drinking joy.I love it - every sip is like the bottle busts awesome unicorn gism into my mouth to the point of swelling my cheeks as I suck with ever increasing intensity and swallow - I freaking love this freaking hydration bottle.===================WHY I LOVE IT===================Why do I love these?First off - I work around a lot of tech equipment and a spilled drink would be a disaster. I think of these as "big boy" sippy cups. At work I sometimes have to fix laptops and computers that get spilled on. You'd be amazed at all the different kinds of people that spill drinks on their computers - executives, warehouse workers and every body in between. No level of success keeps people from being knocking over drinks. It is hard to meet someone that tells the truth and hasn't yet knocked over a drink on someone's computer.I don't spill - my big boy sippy cups knock over - and liquid comes out, but only tiny amounts and if you are quick, not even a swallow of drink escapes. SAVES THE DAY every time.Another huge reason - I want a clean, sterile non-disposable beverage vessel. I want a straw like experience whilst I sip - but I also want to be able to break the thing down so that I can properly wash it in the dishwasher (even though the instructions tell you not to - I put all pieces on the dishwasher's top rack and even run anti-bacterial mode.)Another top feature: It doesn't sweat even on the hottest most humid days.======================================Things that may annoy some======================================After a year or so of heavy use (meaning lots of washes in the dishwasher - nearly nightly washes) the adhesive that keeps the inner "sleeve" in place will loosen and slide out of the outer insulating barrier.Why might this annoy?+ Well, unless you glue it back, it doesn't stay together when lifted.+ Since the air tight seal is broken, things sweat a little (or a lot depending on how bad you end up cracking the outer thermal sleeve.)This may not happen to you - like I said - I had been rough on my first ones. I've ridden them like the little dirty drink donkeys that they are. And despite the abuse - they've been useful for YEARS.The other thing is that if you close the lid, leave a cold drink in a hot car (for even 20 minutes) and do not open VERY slowly - it will shoot beverage all in your face (LOL) - beverage facial FTW!I freaking love these things. Thought about hording some in case the company goes out of business or discontinues the line.
A1EDEE6TYP8NVO	0	1	I have read many texts regarding Greek/Roman mythology, but until now have not spent any time on mythology of other areas. This book is NOT one to read as an intro to Celtic mythology. Even references to the well-known character of King Arthur sound foreign to those who only know the most famous of the fairy-tale stories.I found two highly related problems with reading this book. The first is the assumption by the author that you have already had an introduction to a history of the Isles. Second is the difficulty in reading the names of characters. To someone who is not familiar with pronouncing names with multiple consonants and many W's, V's, and Y's in them, it takes away from the enjoyment and educational value of the book.However, in all fairness, if you do not have these weeknesses (as I do), then you will probably find this book very enlightening. Squire seems to have really researched the topic and speculates that various gods/heros are 'reincarnated' over the ages to fit the ideals of the current society.
A1EDEE6TYP8NVO	1	1	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and taking its included I.Q. test. Not only do I now know what my I.Q. currently is, I also know that one test does not indicate intelligence. Munzert is excellent in explaining what the test attempts to measure and gives insight into the development of one's intelligence starting at birth.Being a father of two young children myself, I found the text very enlightening and look forward to enhancing my children's awareness of their environment as well as working on their standard 'academic studies'.As an educator, I also enjoyed Munzerts assertions about right-brained individuals being 'judged' less intelligent because they do not think in a way that matches the standard educational system (mostly structured, analytical, and serial as opposed to unstructured and creative.)
A1EDG29MA0ZAXZ	1	1	I won't bore you with the details, the other reviewers have done that. I just wanted to add another 5 star review for this great salad spinner. My wife loves it and the lettuce lasts a lot longer now.
A1EDG29MA0ZAXZ	1	1	I purchased to of these at my company, one to mount upside down on the ceiling and the other for portable use. That way if one dies for some reason we can use the other.On the whole it does what it advertises so I won't go into the specs, but here are the things that I particularly like:> Not too heavy> The power and video cables come with nice velcro ties for wrapping them up> Comes with a decent case. Just enough room for the essentials but not much else> Nice and bright even with the lights on> Good color, plus several color adjustments so if you are shooting against a wall painted something other than white you can still get a correctly colored picture.> Picture does not shoot straight out the lens but actually at an angle up. So even without using the foot (or a book) you get a square picture above the height of the table it is shooting from> Buttons on top are convenient and easy to use> In particular the keystone buttons are right on top so you can adjust keystoning without having to dig through a menu> Allows a second VGA input for a second Computer> VGA out for a monitor> Optional Remote Commander has laser, mouse/PowerPoint control and is backlit (looks like a Christmas Tree!)> The main video connection and cable input is an M1-DA* to VGA/USB.> User-replaceable lamp easily accessed from the bottomMy (mostly minor) dislikes include:> Lens cap fits nice but the rubber strap that holds it to the projector is a bit hoaky and I don't expect it to last long> The standard remote is mostly useless. All it controls are the basic projector settings and nothing else. In most cases you set this up before your presentation and can do it right at the projector without the remote. At least built in laser would be nice> The button that releases the foot for height adjustments requires significant pressure to release the foot*M1-DA looks kind of like DVI but isn't exactly the same. It is used on projectors and allows a single cable connection for both VGA and USB for when you want to use their Remote Commander. Other infrared remotes might also work through it but I haven't tested any.
A1EDG29MA0ZAXZ	0	0	For the most part, other reviewers are correct - it is fun and the kids are wowed at first. They all loved it when they first got theirs and enjoyed using it a lot for a while. But eventually the poor design of the door gets really bothersome.The door hinges on the bottom which at first seems OK. However, when withdrawing money, if there is any significant number of coins in the bank at all, several are bound to get caught in the hinge. Then you are stuck prying them out or the door popping off the hinge entirely. Then you have to lay the thing on its back and drop all the coins back in, re-attach the door, close the door and then stand it back up again. If we had ours mounted to the wall (which is an option) it would be an even worse pain having to constantly take if off the wall.Of the three we had, the oldest eventually stopped allowing withdrawls and would revert to asking for the PIN when you the withdrawl button. And for the other two, As often as our kids wanted to open theirs and count their money, these just weren't worth keeping. Ours went up for sale on craigslist.
A1EDG29MA0ZAXZ	0	1	I received the La Crosse 9611U for Christmas last year and I am not using it anymore because of the problems I have had.(I used my unit only with the single sensor that came with it so I cannot speak to using more than one sensor.)First off when the remote sensor was placed immediately next to the main unit they would both report different temperatures - usually off by a degree or two. This I find unacceptable. There is no reason for them to be off that much. I believe the remote sensor was the one that was off because the main unit matched the temperature reported by my thermostat.The second one that bothered me was the requirement to setup the whole unit from scratch every time the sensor needed a battery replacement. This seems totally unnecessary. There is no reason it couldn't retain the connection information of the sensor so as to be able to reconnect after the battery replacement.Another, that was minor, was that the screen required viewing at an odd angle to make it easiest to read. I am a tall person and I had it mounted just below eye level on the wall but I had to always bend down to read it clearly. It is as if they expect users to always mount it higher than their head to read. Maybe they were thinking more about desktop use the wall mounting.The last was the wall mount. If you look at the product images, on the one shows a diagram of the back, the rectangle that represents the stand and battery compartment is actually a section that protrudes from the back. That means the keyhole is not flush against the wall. If you mount it in such a way to attempt to make the thermometer tight against the wall it instead forces the bottom of the unit out. That prevents tightening the screw in a way that would secure it to the wall. In my house, with three boys, that translates to it easily being bumped off the wall and hitting the floor. After a couple of those it stopped receiving from the sensor and I thought I don't need another indoor thermometer so I stopped using it.
A1EDIMZ0RWFO5Q	0	0	I've been looking for one of these for awhile to have "on the go". I based my purchase of this item on the reviews and this time it didn't work out for me.This product is very cheaply made. The cap falls off constantly and I have to shake it to get it to work. It doesn't trim anything other than very fine hairs. Any other stubble it can't handle. I'll never buy again.
A1EDIMZ0RWFO5Q	1	1	I've recently began using this product line, and I am quite impressed. The products are well made, absorb well, and really moisturize my skin. It's refreshing to have an effective product line that is modestly priced and safe for my family.
A1EDIMZ0RWFO5Q	1	1	I feed three rottweilers a BARF diet and this is a great addition. The dogs love it, and I like that I can just open the can and provide them with quality natural nutrition. I usually make their vegetable mixture, so this is a nice break sometimes.

A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	One doesn,t need 1,000 words to review a book that tells a magnificent story. It,s about all the things that are important in life, told in a remarkable way. It has excitement, truth, high adventure and is a delight to read. My entire family enjoyed it! What a film, someday
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	0	I found this book hard to get through and not of this authors stanard. He should have taken a better perspective on the story line. The characters were ill defined and not well rounded. all and all this book should be rewritten to suitt this authors abilitis and talent.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	I found Mosby's Rangers to be a very interesting book and it is now one of my all-time favorites, Wersh gave very a detailed history of Mosby's life and his actions as a guerilla raider in the Civil War.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	1	When I say that Gene Siskel was the better critic (and writer), it's not just sentiment talking. How in the heck does one give **** to so many perfectly average movies (like &quot;L.A. Story&quot;) as Ebert does in his book? The biggest fault with this annual collection is that it completely fails in its intention. Ebert seems to think of this as a more in-depth version of Leonard Maltin's guide but who needs to read a full-length review of a movie to determine if it's worth a rental or watching on the late show? A better idea for Ebert would be to just issue a complete volume of his work through the years instead of dumping the same reviews (with some additional material to make it &quot;new&quot;) on the market year after year.

A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	The idea may have seemed good, but it wasn't. The book is just filled with the articles Mr. Vass wrote for Baseball Digest. He didn't give you any information on the players, nor did he follow up on the player he had just written about. Listen to me people. As an avid reader of Baseball Digest, I never thought George Vass' articles were good, nor did I think they fitted the magazine. Don't waste your money on this book. Go out and read a better baseball book.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	Harris revealed himself at last in this stinker of a self-parody. It shows he has nothing but contempt for his readers. Anyone can go to the library and search back issues of The Wine Spectator, Cuisine Magazine and Fodor's Italy and come up with enough obscure references to truffles and wine to sound erudite to the unwashed masses. This book was not a thriller. It contained no thrill. Harris just filled 484 pages with his self gratification fantasies dressed up like trailer trash at the opera.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	0	Oh no Wonder's really going to die but I guess it has to be sometime but what happened to Honor Bright she was my absoloutley favorite and Cindy too.I think it would be cool if Christina liked racing instead of Jumping.Jumping seems really boring because all you do is jump over fences.Racing is better because you get to run for the glory with a lot of competition.I think that it will be sad to see Wonder go.I cried when Storm died he was a sweet horse but I guess he had to go.I would like to know where Glory's Joy went because I had a feeling she could be a lot like her sire March To Glory.I also think that Honor could have been a great racehorse because she was a lot like Wonder's Champion.Please have the books be about racing and have all the characters back that were in the sereis:Cindy,Max,Honor,Glory's Joy,The Townsends etc.They need to get more exciting stuff in the series like racing!
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	Has anyone else thought of giving it as a gift to interested young adults? I think it makes a marvellous children's or beginners' book and would like very much to see additional material from this authoress.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	This book is indeed the book with everything. I was impressed with both the style and the plush storyline. The orgasmic pictures included were both cyntillating and stimulating.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	This book is a classic example of hagiography. There's a lot of unadulterated praise here. A lot of it! But, there's very little real substance. I want to read about Ronald Reagan's life, not sing his praises from the highest mountaintop. Dinesh D'Souza would do well to learn the historian's art of objectivity. It's what's most obviously lacking in this tome.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	This book brings back such pleasant memories of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern series as it used to be. Given the hack job and butchery that have been done to the character in the 1990s, archival editions like this remain our only resource to the way the classic character truly was. Buy it and savor it.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	Anyone who thought that the character of Hal Jordan was gettingstale need look no further than this book to find out that there areindeed worse things. Hal Jordan's character maintained a loyal fan base for thirty years, but Kyle Rayner's character gets old, stale, and boring after the first panel. Who cares about this Gen X slacker who had a power ring dropped into his lap without doing anything to earn it? I certainly don't.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	Exactly what the world needs, to understand when to argue andwhen not to. It also explains the importance of debate in oursociety.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	1	This book is just written by some dude. Get the one straight from Ensemble. It's got better strategies, especially for online play, the best element of the game.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	The Oathbound Wizard is about a boy called Mathew that has travelled through dimensions and has ended up as the Lord Wizard in a country called Merovence.In this world thigs you say are taken more literally than here and Matt swears that he will overthrough the evil Wizard Lord of Ibile.Matt goes into Ibile and defeats the evil Lord (picking up loads of friends on the way) and marries Queen Alisande of Merovence.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	Yet another watered-down Bond novel based upon a movie script that has little to do with Ian Fleming's original character.Without a doubt, the champaign corks must have immediately started popping in the halls of the Library of Congress once the release of this book was announced.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	i got this book for my birth day a i read it. i thought that itall talk a bout soccer, but it didn't. i taked abot how he grow up inbrazil and how the enverment was so diffecult in there. how he escaped from all bad things like gaging and drug and alcholes. his father was not so lucky. he smoked and he had alot of alckholes and drug. he was very unkind to his wife and his son. there fore, his wife decided to built up her self and her son.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	0	0	Cannot believe he talks of Shawshank Redemption so poorly! Does not know a good heartfelt movie when he sees one. Possibly burnt out from seeing so many he has become quite dillusional.
A1EDOWER7RO6KZ	1	1	The book I read was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I have also read Harry Potter and the Prisoner from Azkaban, but I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is more exciting. I like it because it is adventurous and each person has a unique personality. Harry has a lot of problems and ends up in trouble. Harry is also very famous, which he doesn't even know. He lives in a muggle world with his aunt and uncle and doesn't have any parents. He also has to deal with his cousin, Dudley, who always beat him up. Read Harry Potter to find out what happens next!
A1EDQ9Q692BV64	1	1	Very well built. I would recommend this product to anyone. Assembly was easy. I installed my Chop/slide saw on top of this.
A1EDQ9Q692BV64	1	1	I would recommend this detailer to keep you vehicles spotless. I have a black truck and it's a must.
A1EDQ9Q692BV64	1	1	Product is great for steaks. I ordered one then another after using the first. Pros: Keeps steak hot and juices on plate, great for reheating on grill also. Cons: Pretty pricey and I hope the wooden base holds up as long as the cast iron plate. If it does, it was well worth the extra money.
A1EE6QR3Z7D9NK	1	1	This is probably the best all-encompassing bridge book ever written. While not every subject is covered in excruciating detail, enough is within its covers to last a fledgling player for a very long time. And while an experienced player may not agree with every tenet espoused, when has any group of bridge players ever agreed on anything wholeheartedly?

A1EE74CSKECDJL	0	0	My son and I often exchange books so we can have a better insight into each other. I am a very intelligent person and a fast reader. This 285 page book took me 6 weeks to read; I had to read it with a dictionary by my side and when I was done my final comment was..WHAT???????????????????????????????The most hilarious part of this book and experience for me was that the author references many, many psychologists and others throughout the book in a way that it is assumed the average reader knows who these people are. (I guess I am not average; half of them I had no clue.) However, at one point he mentions Frank Sinatra and feels the need to add a parenthetical remark to explain to the readers who Sinatra was. So, that said, before you purchase this book ask yourself if you are the sort of person that knows names like Rank, Jung, Adler etc like the back of your hand and needs names like Sinatra explained to you. If you are, then by all means..buy this book. If not, then I hope you have a darn good reason why you have bought this book.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	0	0	I know it is an all time best seller but it bored me witless. If you don't want to slash your wrists at least start on page 77.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	0	Besides the title line---Life Changing---I really do not know what to say. I never re-read a book but I have re-read this one often. If you are looking for sound relationship advice, especially if you are a Christian, this is it.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	I am not a fan of ginger in the least but nothing helps my frequent queasy stomach like two of these spicy apple ginger chews. It is truly amazing stuff.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	This movie was a gracious gift from one of the people appearing in the film. Prior to this I had only seen this person in comedic roles and was expecting more of the same with Upside. I was so wrong. I hope you will give the movie a chance. It starts slow but the development of the story and the ending make it all worth the watching. It is beautifully done and I believe all ages will benefit from it. However, if you have a teenager or a young adult, make this a MUST see together. I assure you my 5 star rating has nothing to do with the individual who worked in the film. It is simply THAT good...
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	Just can't even put into words how much freedom I received after reading this book. I couldn't put it down. For all of these years I thought I was the only one that felt this way.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	I am always cautious when I read books of this nature because it is easy for an author to use the Bible as a "buffet" picking the parts they like and leaving what they do not. This was certainly not what this author did. I found it to be dead-on accurate, informative and well worth the read. I highly recommend it to anyone with sincere questions about this subject.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	...don't miss it. A lot of depth in a very tiny book. Being used as a Sunday School book and I can see why.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	I have always struggled with books that make the automatic assumption that those we try to share our faith with accept the premise that the Bible IS the Word of God. If that is not the case, all the helpful &#34;tips&#34; that follow are out the door. This book starts, literally, at square one. It is a must have in anyone' s library that has loved ones that are not yet walking with Christ.
A1EE74CSKECDJL	1	1	This was recommended by my dermatologist. I have no end of skin issues all over my body. He recommended this to kill any surface bacteria or yeast. It has helped more than words can say. Apply, wait a minute or so and then dry with a hair dryer set on cool or allow to dry in open air.I have no idea how it works as a mouth rinse. I have never used it for that.

A1EEBD6LIVEVPI	0	0	It was free so no complaints, but would not purchase with money. It was a short story so for those that like short stories wouldn't mind this book for free.
A1EECHHO2NFSUP	0	0	Don't know how one can write a serious review on a book like this, so I won't even try. It is not funny or erotic, not even sexy. In my view, the book is demeaning to women AND men ... and probably to a fair number of animals. I suspect that the University of Chicago and the Duke Law School are embarassed to have to claim Tucker Max as an alumnus. In fact, after reading this book, the case against the Duke Lacrosse Team should possibly be re-opened.While I don't judge the work to be pornographic, I can find nothing of socially redeeming value among its pages. The reader completes the book having been drenched in all manner of human fluids and finds no epiphany at its conclusion. Tucker Max begins his adventures as the nether orfice of a man, and by the end the orfice has become even bigger ... if not infected.I normally recycle books that I don't intend to re-read by donating them to a local auxiliary who distributes them to hospital patients and shut-ins. In this case, I think I'll just recycle it as scrap paper.
A1EECHHO2NFSUP	1	1	With our local commercial smoker getting increasingly proud of his product, we decided to get a home smoker for ourselves as a belated Christmas gift. When the smoker arrived, I immediately "cured" it per the instructions, and everything seemed to work perfectly. When I tried to smoke some sausages, it was a different story. The smoke generator started advancing the smoking discs like a slot machine paying off in Vegas. I made two calls to customer service, and each time the folks were helpful, trying to give me tips on how I could repair the smoke generator myself. After the third call it was apparent to them that the problem was beyond my capabilities, and they agreed to send me a new smoke generator.The new replacement part arrived in a timely manner, and I have had no problems since then. I would, however, recommend that if you decide to purchase this somoker, you go the extra expense and get an Auber PID to control the temperature. The existing slide control and temperature guage that come with the Original Bradley Smoker are kind of rinky-dink and make it difficult to control accurate temperatures. The Auber PID solves this problem perfectly.Even with the initial problems, I think this is a pretty good smoker for the cost, and I have nothing but good things to say about Bradley's customer service department.
A1EECHHO2NFSUP	1	1	Okay, I'm an old fart who likes to cook now and then. True, my wife does the brunt of the daily kitchen stuff, but I mess around with home-smoking meats, sausage making etc. Before I bought these measuring cups, I think we had 4 or 5 sets scattered around the property (green house, barn, etc) but not ONE COMPLETE set. With the way these nest AND the little ring keeper, these will likely stay together. That is, if we remember to snap them together.Like most OXO products, these cups feel good in your hands, too. Good tools.
A1EEMGMFHIEQBS	1	1	Markish presents the thesis that erasmus was asemitic, rather than antisemite OR friend to the jews. While on the face of things this may seem a rather bland arguement for a book, it is nonetheless a very important one in the field of Reformation historiography. Although the afterword of the book solidly disputes the monograph (the reader tends to wonder why it was included) Markish's work is hard to argue with and makes for an enlightening read. A must have for any Reformation scholar.
A1EEMGMFHIEQBS	1	1	This book is exceptional in terms of quality. The essays in The Mass Internment vary by time. Some are from the 1940s, while others are contemoraneous to the books publication date. The actual articles are incredibly valuable to the internment scholar. Many books are excellent social histories of the event, but few aside from Peter Irons have chronicled the legal and politcal history of the internment in such as manner as the articles in this work. Utilizing vast amounts of government documents, in addition to other secondary sources, these articles succeed in present varying accounts of the intenment while maintaining a high level of excellence. Well worth the price.
A1EEMGMFHIEQBS	0	1	My dog released her anal glands on my couch, so I had a pretty massive stink to eliminate. I tried this product, and all it did was replace an anal gland smell with a flowery anal gland smell. I needed this to remove a smell, and it failed completely. For other odors, it may work well - but it didnt do what I needed. I would recommend Odor Go! by Tomlyn
A1EEP9K1D52R30	1	1	I thought the curved handle was just a marketing gimmick, but it really makes it easier to hold on to the brush. The bristles are very soft. I'm surprised to find that I really like this brush! I'm going to give the ultrasoft one a try next time. Highly recommened! You can also send this back to Preserve using a pre-maid postage label that you can print from their website to recycle the Preserve the toothbrush. Highly recommended!
A1EEP9K1D52R30	1	1	Just like everyone else that's already mentioned, this is the best night guard I've ever used. The kit I got had a regular-sized and a small-sized one. The regular-sized (and just like every other one in the drugstore or supermarket) was too big, but the small-sized one was perfect! I messed up on the first one while I was trying to mold it (I guess the water got too hot, so the whole thing just melted into a big ball),so I contacted Customer Service at Dental Hygiene Preferred Inc. and described my situation. Without even asking for a picture of my plastic "ball", Erin offered to send me a replacement, product AND shipping free-of-charge! She even let me choose what color I wanted (Color really doesn't matter. The point is, not only did she send me a replacement, she let me choose exactly what I wanted). Learning from my first mistake, I boiled the water first, poured it into a small cup, and left the original guard in for 25 seconds, took it out, got rid of the excess water, and molded it. It's perfect! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable night guard that works well! Don't hesitate to contact CS if you have any questions!
A1EEP9K1D52R30	0	0	I like the concept of a sprayable sunblock; however, this one has such a strong fragrance that it makes me gag. It literally leaves a trail of sunblock scent in my house. I'd look for another sunblock.
A1EEPI1FX23UVX	1	1	The thesis of Sagar's "Literature and the Crime Against Nature" is that literature has a crucial contribution to make in helping us to recognize and reaffirm our relationship with nature, showing us that in a deep and primal way, our emotional well-being depends on our willingness to embrace the earth-bound, natural part of ourselves.Sagar takes on a penetrating exploration of the writings of Shakespeare, Aeschylus, Euripides, Coleridge, Conrad, Golding, Lawrence and Hughes, as well as others, bringing to the surface the unifying theme running through their works, namely, the need to nurture our ties with the natural world, and the perils that ensue when we split ourselves off from our sensual selves.Anyone who loves literature and seeks a deeper appreciation of the truths in these great literary works, or who has a curiosity about their own instinctual nature and their relationship with the natural world will be enriched by this book.
A1EEPI1FX23UVX	1	1	When we bandy about such familiar terms as "instinct," "innate" and "inherited behaviors" are we saying anything meaningful, or are we merely using vague catchphrases that give a false semblance of understanding? Blumberg develops his case against nativism in an incisive and cogent way, showing the extent to which research in the fields of developmental psychology, ethology and evolutionary psychology has been an imbroglio of false assumptions, nave explanations, illogic, and high sounding language, much of it lacking substance. Drawing on eye opening research in animal and human behavior, Blumberg exposes the failings of the nativists and evolutionary psychologists in their search for innate behaviors and neural modules. Blumberg takes us beyond the trappings of language to the intriguing complexity of behavior development and non-genetic modes of inheritance. He shows the falsity of simplistic causal notions such as genes being "programmed for" or "controlling" behavior. He rightly recognizes the wall of opposition he is up against, since the nativist view is a popular sell--we are enamored by easily digested explanations of how our genes determine who we are, our traits, our ability to reason, and our use of language. Contrary to what one reviewer has stated, nowhere does Blumberg suggest that natural selection cannot impact on our genes. What he demonstrates is that the processes are more involved and bidirectional than the nave conception of organisms as having genes "for" complex behaviors like, for example, a sharp memory or being a good typist. As Blumberg clearly states:"inheritance does not necessarily implicate genes, and it certainly does not imply genetic determination (unless all one means by this is that genes are somehow involved, which is trivially true of every behavioral trait)."I am sure Blumberg's ideas will fly over the heads of most nativists emotionally attached to their ideas, but his call for more stringent scientific research and analysis, and his invitation to a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the intersecting events between genes and behavior will be of interest to those who value clear thinking and good science. Every student in psychology and biology, indeed in any discipline, could benefit from this book, for it reveals how easily we can be mesmerized by ideas.
A1EEPI1FX23UVX	1	1	In "The Power of Now" Tolle introduces the reader to the experience of living in the present moment-in the "Now." He explains how misery, suffering and unhappiness in the world are the consequence of living an "unconscious" life of grasping for things, being the servant of our ego and our conditioned responses, clinging to the past and fretting about the future, yearning for certainty in an uncertain world. His message of accepting what "is" and finding freedom in the present moment is not new, but is fresh and lucid. He draws from Buddhist and Daoist ideas and in an involving style quietly leads us toward the experience of "Being." For those who are looking for a self-help book of lists, steps and formulas to achieve enlightenment, you will not find it here, and appropriately so. The mantra Tolle repeats is that there is no formula. What Tolle is teaching is not an idea, but an experience. The challenge of putting this experience into words is always fraught with danger-the danger of too rigidly relying on language to convey what cannot be spoken. Tolle warns us of this and to some extent succeeds in avoiding traps of language.I recommend this book, but have some quibbles. My greatest objection concerns Tolle's belief that humans are evolving or progressing toward a greater consciousness. I see no compelling evidence of this on our battered planet. Pockets of consciousness exist, yes, but overshadowed by a massive inventory of pervasive human dysfunction, not only at the level of nation pitted against nation, but right down to the level of our crime ridden streets, our broken families, and our strife filled relationships. Tolle's conviction in the evolution of consciousness seems mostly wishful thinking, and as such, a manifestation of ego yearning for a fanciful future. There is some danger that Tolle's overenthusiastic proselytizing can become transformed into an ideology of perfection, leaping beyond all boundaries of human knowledge, much like Hegel's idealist philosophy of historical unfolding toward absolute Self-Consciousness. We should not let ourselves be too taken in by our technological feats, lulling ourselves with the self-congratulatory belief in our spiritual and moral advance. The simple truth is that none of us know what the future holds. The more realistic, earth bound scenario, based on what we know of mankind up to this point, is that we will continue to oscillate between ego clinging and release, and that the tide can quickly turn in the opposite direction with little warning. Our ego dominates the world. The war in Iraq is a war of ego. The war on drugs is a war of ego. The war of good against evil is a war of ego. The language of "war" that permeates our social and political life shows how far we are from what Tolle hopes for.Tolle in "The Power of Now" gives creative, idiosyncratic interpretations of passages and parables in the Bible, taking these as unequivocal metaphors of living a conscious as opposed to an unconscious, time bound, self invested, existence. He thus weaves together God and Being into the single notion of Presence. While his interpretation of Biblical passages is imaginative and emotionally awakening, I take issue with his rather black and white peremptory attitude that his interpretation is the only correct view of what the prophets had intended. What we instead have is Tolle's own unique spin. This peremptory tone comes through repeatedly across the pages, and should at least give one pause to consider that Tolle, himself, is still not free of his own ego. On the one hand Tolle attunes us to the illusory nature of form and of opposites in our constructed, ego invested world, and yet at the same time, he imposes his own personal form on us. Contradictions, of course, are inevitable whenever anyone tackles a subject as daunting and ineffable as the nature of reality, but to speak with grand conviction as Tolle does, while ignoring his own susceptibility to contradiction and error is perhaps evidence of his own ego boundness.Human probes into the nature of reality humble us all, and Tolle's periodic pompous tone seems out of place and not in the spirit of Buddhist teaching. It took away from his otherwise lucid, engaging style. Even so, if we were to follow the path Tolle opens for us, and we all came closer to living in the Now, the world probably would be a better home for us and future generations.
A1EEQWHL0GYKGV	1	1	What a breath of fresh air. Demetri is zany, intelligent and highly observant of the world the rest of us take for granted. Topic after topic will find you nodding in agreement as you laugh yourself silly.
A1EEQWHL0GYKGV	1	1	While this is not great film-making or an outstanding documentary, it is a very important one. Today's mass media is so lost in its political correctness that we can never learn the truth about islam from them. So it is crucial, then, that someone step up and show islam for what it is: an irrational, hateful depository of 8th century pre-medieval mysticism -- anti-mankind, anti-womankind, and anti-life.It is frightening to think that 2/3 of the world's population still adhere's to 'prophet-based' religions (as if god needs prophets to speak to the rest of us), and half of that group holds on to this unenlightened primitive doctrine, and a large number of them will kill for it. This is a must see for anyone who is not clear about what islam intends for those of us who refuse to accept their 'truth'.
A1EEQWHL0GYKGV	1	1	I love wearing this cologne. From the time I spray a poof of it in the a.m., until the evening is over and well into the night, the exotic spices in this magic elixir stimulate nostrils everywhere. So many positive comments, it is a knock-out fragrance.
A1EEQWHL0GYKGV	0	1	The version of 'River of Jordan' on this album discards the original lyrics for a more politically correct version. . . what was once "we are the father, we are the son" has PC'd into "we are the father, mother daughter and son". What a disaster, adding extra syllables and a new meaning completely ruins the tempo and bastardizes the beautiful original tune. This is what happens when liberal PC sentiments muscle out innocence.A few of the songs on this album hold up and work well with the new collaborations, but River of Jordan isn't one of them.

A1EEQWHL0GYKGV	1	1	Mad Men is a very well-polished series, but few of the characters have any heroic qualities, they are all pretty amoral and scummy.However, having said that, the DVDs in the series are very good, and the commentaries for at least two or three episodes on every disk are a great feature. The comments by the writers, directors, and actors are all very revealing into the vision and mindset of the creative team.I would really like to see some characters who aren't so deeply flawed, however. Such a universal lack of good judgment and good life choices is just sad and morose. Real life has nicer people, at least I want to believe that.

A1EF136NCZ6MSO	0	0	Before I saw this film, I honestly thought I couldn't hate a movie more than I hated Armageddon. Boy was I wrong! As bad as Armageddon is, it at least has a coherent ending. Though Lost Highway had infuriated me, The Straight Story made me forgive Lynch for indulging himself in utter absudity for it's own sake. But with Mulholland Drive, I realized that he is a lost case. Lynch has descended completely into the echo chamber of his own mind, and he's not interested in letting the rest of us in.
A1EF136NCZ6MSO	1	1	This is the best science fiction I've read in years. Egan takes his ideas farther and faster than most authors could dream of, and Diaspora is the wildest journey he's taken yet. At times when reading Egan my head actually gets warmer from my mind being blown continually. I've been tracking down all of his titles but many are hard to find. Grab his stuff while you can and spread the word. This is an author who deserves more recognition.
A1EF6CT873SP4P	0	1	This review is not based on creative content but on an apparent DVD production flaw. Having bought, watched and enjoyed Mad Men season 1 from amazon.com, we ordered the season 2 discs from NetFlix. The first set that arrived wouldn't play in either of our DVD players ("No Disc" error message), so NetFlix shipped a replacement set - same result. We then ordered the season 2 discs from amazon.com - and again the discs wouldn't play. We returned them for credit (excellent service from amazon.com, as always). None of the discs had any obvious flaws or damage - they just wouldn't play. These are the ONLY discs that have ever given us this result; all other DVDs, whether commercial or recorded on our DVR, play perfectly well on both of our machines. Would be interested toi know if anyone else has encountered this phenomenon, or has any suggestions about what the problem might be.
A1EF6CT873SP4P	1	1	Everything that Gavin Lyall wrote is intelligent, entertaining and informative. Combine Neville Shute, Frederick Forsythe, Ernest K. Gann and Ian Fleming, and you'd get Gavin Lyall. Highly recommended.
A1EF9US30MUM7D	1	1	I'm very happy with these cables. A lot of people have this strange idea that "digital cables" need to be incredibly expensive, but they clearly don't. It's either gonna work, or it's not, and by "not" work, I mean you'll either hear nothing, or your audio will be on and off, broken up. This cable works fine, and it appears to be MUCH higher quality than an optical cable I received with my sound card.\I don't care what anyone says, you will not hear a "difference in audio quality" between a cheap, and expensive optical cable. The data is being sent digitally as light pulses - you don't get good or bad light pulses.. they either make it from one end to the other, or they don't. You will not hear a difference in quality. You will either hear sound, or NO sound. That is what digital means - 1 or 0, on or off.Cheap, works well, no problems. Don't ever buy some overpriced digital cable, based on "quality" lies.

A1EFBUK1FQ0SXD	0	0	WOW! This movie stunk on so many levels, I don't know where to start. My son & I really enjoy watching the first two and were terribly disappointed while struggling to endure through this mess. The story line COULD HAVE been interesting; but the script and the acting was painful to watch. Brandon (whom I love) seemed to be sleepwalking through the movie; and the relationship between him & his son (and his wife) was just stupid. I HATED, HATED the actress who replaced Rachel! Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (whom I also love) were the ONLY interesting characters worth watching. Unfortunately, the martial arts were reduced to a minimum - too bad. Even John Hannah lacked his quirky humor that makes him so endearing. Overall, a big jip!
A1EFBUK1FQ0SXD	1	1	This is by far my favorite bond yet.Not only is Daniel Craig a delicious specimen for our female viewers' enjoyment;We finally get to see a softer side of the otherwise jaded misogynist stereotype that decades of 007 has portrayed.This Bond appears to genuinely LIKE women in these films and isn't afraid to show his "sensitive" side.This is a sequel to Casino Royal, where our hero falls in love (spoiler alert) and his motives are now fueled by revenge.Daniel Craig is a refreshing change from Pierce (yuk) with his smarmy quips and cocky attitude. This bond had a Human quality.aaaahhh... sit back and enjoy!
A1EFFZQHWK5S6B	0	1	The music on the album is great.There's no question about it.However,the album presents two problems:The jacket was tore apart in one side and the other one was the vinyl itself. The vinyl was very dirty with some stains on it. A bad pressing I think.I had to reattach the jacket with some glue and clean up the record.Despite doing all of this.The vinyl had many pops and clicks.I had to sell the album and buy another one in a local store.This one was much better.I don't know what's happening with the US pressings.The same happened with the Beatles Vinyl box set 2012(this item wasn't bought on Amazon),but It's somethig it's happening.
A1EFFZQHWK5S6B	1	1	This is a remarkable album.In my opinion it's are you experienced part II.It contains a phenomenal group of songs like &#34;Spanish castle magic&#34;,&#34;You got me floaating&#34;,the title track and the standard &#34;little wing&#34;.&#34;She's so fine&#34; is also great.Very well crafted songs.One of my favorite rock albums definitely.Make yourself a favor a get it from AMAZON.You won't regret it.The vinyl arrived in perfect condition without any flaws.The sound is really great ,very quiet record.I'm back to vinyls and I can tell you that I hear some things that I don't hear on the cd.These guys are making great work with jimi's vinyls and cds.Congratulations and thanks a lot.The art work is also fantastic.You've got some pictures and comments about the story and influence of the album.I rate the product 4 stars because I got it late.But I strongly recommend this album for your library.
A1EFFZQHWK5S6B	1	1	This is a great album.The first time I met this album was on vinyl.Through the years I bought different editions on cd.I wasn't quite satisfied with those cds.However,this time I can say that "they hit the nail on the head".This Tarkus set 2012 sounds FANTASTIC!.It was a good idea to have Steven Wilson for the remasters and remixes.He's done a wonderful job.I want to thank AMAZON because the service is excellent and very fast.Tarkus is probably one of the best albums of the progressive era.I would like to see the same treatment for the other albums;especially those that belong to the best moments of ELP and as well the progressive era.For example:"Pictures at an exhibition","Trilogy","Salad brain surgery" and "Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends".As a fan of ELP I strongly recommend this new edition of Tarkus.It contains 3 discs.2cds and 1 dvd.The 1st cd is the original album,the 2nd one is the album with new mixes and the 3rd is the dvd audio.You can play the dvd audio on any dvd player or blu-ray player.I'm not sure if this dvd audio has another layer for only dvd audio players because I don't have that hardware.I played it on my blu-ray and it sounds terrific.A MUST.
A1EFLQ5Z6MUMBR	1	1	I bought this book because Cal Newport's book, though much simpler, was not cutting it for me. I have seen this book in the hands of one of our star students in high school and now, in college, I felt maybe I should give in and seriously check it out.I read it once in high school and it was just too much for me to understand. Hopefully, my summary and view points will help you get it because this book really is amazing and I wish I had it my whole college career!FIrst, I do want to say that I haven't had the chance to follow EVERY step yet for a full semester. I'm just using my intuition here and my own past experiences. Secondly, the author wants you to develop a love for learning --- not a need for making high marks or fearing what others think. The best way to be motivated to stay on top of your studies is to learn how to allow yourself to get lost in the learning process. This book doesn't really teach you how to do that if you are not naturally that way. For that, I suggest you learn how to "be in the moment". Google that phrase and adopt it to your life because it will help you in so many other ways but -- when I was in high school, I had no concept of that phrase and so this book kind of baffled me.Thirdly, I do think this technique is time-consuming. I'll explain later which PARTS are time consuming. So I am going to adopt A LOT of what the book says, but not all of it because I really do not have time for all of it.This is basically the technique:BEFORE YOU READAsk "What is my purpose for reading this/listening to this lecture?"- I will adopt this to my education forever. This keeps you focus and makes it easier to skim for what is important and what you don't need to know. This makes reading faster and more efficient.AFTER YOU READ THE TITLES/SUBTITLESAsk "What do I already know about this topic?"- You make a quick list of what you already know about the topic as a brain "warm up". I will probably adopt this.SKIMMING THE MATERIALAsk "What's the big picture here?" and jot it down. Write a "map" of the big ideas you may encounter in your reading. T-his helps you remain focused and increases your comprehension. I will also adopt this.* (When people say this is time consuming, this is what they mean!) READ SENTENCE BY SENTENCE ANDAsk these questions "What's the author going to say next?" "What are the expert questions?" "What questions does this information raise for me?"- Okay, this is way too time consuming. I agree that asking questions while you read is important and it is something I do in my head, but students barely have time to READ, let alone slow down their reading rate asking multiple questions for every sentence. What is this?? I don't see why these questions cannot be applied to your notes while you study, in stead.WHILE YOU READ, ASK THESE TO TAKE NOTESAsking "What information is important here?"- I will adopt this, as I always have. This makes note-taking easier, especially when I know my "purpose". It also allows me to skip some things when I read.- what's important is your personal reactions to information (like "Oh wow, didn't know that!" or "OMG, that's just like x, y, and z."), key concepts, ideas and definitions, and your purposeAsking "How can I summarize/paraphrase this?"- Of course, this is how you take notes, silly!AFTER YOU READYou will combine your class notes and your reading notes (putting missing information where necessary)Ask "How can I organize this information?" *- I asterick'd this because this is also a time consuming concept. I do think it will help you study, but he wants you to put it in as many charts and graphs as you can possibly think of. I think doing 2 or 3 different types of graphs is enough -- it is what I usually do.Ask "How can I picture this info?"- Of course, try to draw a physical representation for concepts. This helps!Ask "What's my hook for remembering?"- use mnemonics! The book also shows you how to make mnemonics stick better.AFTER TAKING NOTES AND ALL THAT JAZZAsk "How does this information fit with what I know?" which means, you need to summarize your notes to fit into one page. And each week, re-do this summary considering the new and old information you have in the class now. I will for sure adopt this.So that's basically his program. I will be adopting most of it and making it my own. For example, making of charts is something I will put on notecards so I can study on the go and when needed, I can tape them in my notebook. Stuff like that. This is a step by step way to study. It takes the guess work out of it and maybe you can change it up to fit your likings from there. And this is how you study for the class everyday -- do this before class in your corresponding textbook or in the lecture. This system may be "time-consuming" because it actually requires you to... study... before there's a test, but you are supposed to be doing that anyways.This book also helps you modify the technique depending on the type of course you are taking (including an in-depth look at math and english). As well as a step-by-step guide to writing papers, studying for an upcoming exam, and a little simple look at "time management" (which is basically this... have a calendar with only school deadlines on it. Have a weekly time sheet with only your class schedule on it. Have a daily to-do list. Have your general calendar--- then when you get an assignment, estimate how long it will take and triple that number. Find how you can fit that in)I give this book 5 stars for providing step by step method of study that you can accommodate to your liking. I think he covers pretty much all the bases.
A1EFLQ5Z6MUMBR	1	1	I've been wanting to try this out for a while, but when I first heard about this, I was a virgin and had never inserted ANYTHING up my vagina. I knew this wasn't going to work. I waited until I was active with a trusted partner to finally buy this. Now, it took a while for me to learn how to put it in. My partner tried to help me, but the cup would always pop open before he could get it all the way in.One night, I inserted it while I was in the shower because I figured out I can insert things easier when my body is warm. Praises be! Because the cup went inside! I could insert the cup using ANY fold as long as I was warm in my shower with one leg hiked up on the rim of the tub. However, I couldn't figure out how to get it to pop open so I took it out.The next day, I inserted it using the punch down fold since it allowed me to insert it easily (small tip makes way for the bigger base) and I hoped it meant the cup will pop open easier without pain (I had heard reports of painful popping. Popping from the C fold looks like it would hurt! Popping from punch down seems easier) then I could push the side a bit more to force it to open up once inside. I wasn't sure if the cup had fully popped open inside, though I was turning it and trying to get it to "unfold". I toyed with it until I was able to stand up and move without really feeling it. As I got out of the tub and moved some more, I felt tiny... bubbles or something going on. I was hoping this was the cup popping open inside.I decided to go to sleep. I touched down there to see if the stem was sticking out as many women suggest cutting it ALL off. Well, it was not. I felt the tip of it just inside of me and it was not "poking" me. I felt slight pressure on my left side and assumed it was just the diva cup pressing slightly against my vaginal wall. I was very worried that the cup may go up too far in me or was hurting my body, but I thought "95% of women who use this LOVE it so I will relax." I went to sleep.The next morning, there were no stains whatsoever in my bed. Hallelujah! I took a shower and tried to pull it out the same way I inserted it, but I couldn't grab hold of the stem. It was JUST inside me, so I couldn't figure how to get my fingers in there without pushing the cup further in! I was worried and asked my partner to help me remove it later in the day when we could meet.Well, a few hours before I was to meet him, I needed to do a #2 and #1. I went to the restroom and did my business. As I was pushing for #2, I felt "bubbling" in my vagina. After I cleaned up #1 and #2, I put my hand to see if the cup had maybe been pushed out. To my surprise, the stem was fully visible poking from outside of me and easy for me to grab! I grabbed it and tugged. It didn't budge. I "pushed" and pulled the stem at the same time and the cup came out further. I remembered the many reports of the pain of removing the cup because of the "sucking". I pulled harder to see if I could feel this and I couldn't. Probably because at that time, I was grabbing the base and pressing it. I pressed the base even more so the cup would kind of fold and I also tipped it a bit toward my back bone because it wouldn't come out if I just yanked it straight. More pushing and pulling of the cup led to smooth delivery with the contents still safe inside the cup.I poured them out and rinsed the cup. I was done and pretty sure that was the last of my cycle. I was right!Thank god! No more diaper wearing "just in case". I did wear a panty liner to make sure the diva cup had collected ALL of the blood and indeed, it was CLEAN AS A WHISTLE when I checked before yoga.Very pleased with this result. I am excited to experiment more with diva cup! :)
A1EFLQ5Z6MUMBR	0	1	I don't see any real benefit to this. I was using this with toothpaste and my teeth did get a shade or two browner (as opposed to using electric tooth brush from sonicare).Also, sometimes, if I angle the brush the wrong way, it irritates my gums.I feel much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush. Maybe there is something to this ionic technology, but its not ENOUGH to whiten teeth and help prevent cavities (a small cavity I had got slightly bigger).I'm keeping this brush exclusively for dry brushing ONLY. This is worth less as a main cleaning tool.
A1EFLQ5Z6MUMBR	1	1	It took a month to notice my nails were growing and breaking off less.After two months, I get a tiny peel on 1 nail one time out of the whole month.I'm going on month 3. Excited to experience long, strong nails.I've never had a product that made my nails stay THIS strong before.I don't know if it is helping my skin. I already have good skin.I have kinky hair. I don't know if it is helping with my hair yet. I just recently went 100% natural, so we will see. I'll update after a few months.
A1EFMPFEY0AXF4	1	1	I think that you could never sum up Don Dixon with any one word, but those two words in my title probably come closest. I first heard Praying Mantis (his claim to fame as it were) when I was in college. After the enjoyment I got out of that one song, I decided to look into this guy a bit more. I was pleased with what I found on this album. If you expect songs all sounding like Praying Mantis, then don't bother, but if you want to hear a wide array of music that highlights people playing music to have fun, then this is the album for you.
A1EFMPFEY0AXF4	1	1	I got this watch as a gift and its perfect since i travel a lot around the world.PROS -- definitely recommend the titanium version. this is a big watch and steel could be heavy. worth the 40$ price diff.- nice clean look (steel grey) goes with business and casual attire.- the solar powered battery is great and charging works very well.- Switching analog dial between time zones is real easy.- Two alarms, timer, stop watch etc.CONS:- An annoying quirk is that you cannot set time zones that are in 1/2 hr intervals. eg: places in south asia, canada etc.- the UTC dial is pretty much useless. and takes up space on the watch face.- the time zones are coordinated together. eg: in Italy they have daylight savings a week earlier than the US. but if i set the italian time forward, the US time also sets forward.- The analog dial CANNOT be set independently. It only follows the digital time set in one of the time zones.In summary, the waqtch is nice, but some small changes could really make it perfect.
A1EFMPFEY0AXF4	1	1	I may be a bit biased in my opinion, but this is by far one of the most captivating and immersing games I have ever played (and I've played most of them since the mid 90s!). I have multiple accounts with more 50s than I can shake a stick at (over 30 at this point). I have been playing since 10 OCT 01 (Day One) and this game STILL holds my attention.- They don't "technically" raise the level cap with each expansion.- ToA was a disaster, but that has been severely nerfed at this point that it's much more trivial than ever.- There are actual Rewards and consequences to RvR! This game has by far the best RvR (PvP) system out there!If you are ever on Tintagel/Hibernia, feel free to look me and my guild up (Armyn ab Treanid).
A1EFMPFEY0AXF4	1	1	Just wanted to point out that once again, reality (which we all know has a liberal bias?) supports the premise of this book. While deniers of reality and science will rail against this and gnash their teeth and deny their war on science, while at the same time proclaiming there is a war against their god, one can only look at actual data. Sometimes it's not just about the ignorance, but the rigid adherence to being wrong that makes this so dangerous. Their proclamation that their ignorance is just as good as actual knowledge will be the destruction of this country, not science or gay marriage...Copy and paste this URL to see the paper: [...]
A1EFMPFEY0AXF4	0	0	In a nutshell, the book's thesis is, "My political views are so obviously correct that anyone who doesn't accept them just has to be nuts." It presupposes the truth of a right-wing political outlook and then tries to plumb the reasons why other people do not accept this truth, the conclusion being that they have to be in massive denial.Joan Swirsky, a fan of the book, notes that it "avoids all the usual psychobabble." I hazard to propose that this is because the book does not contain any actual psychological science.
A1EG1AVHWM3GUJ	1	0	Pair a Blackberry Curve 8310 (or iPone) with the MBR-100 and plug the MBR-100 into the auxiliary jack on in your Mazda3 center counsole storage bin and you have a really slick setup for not a lot of money... I have used a number of bluetooth headsets and find the Sony MBR-100 to be very well behaved. Add a Sony car charger to the mix and you never need to remove he device from the car. The device does appear to work while charging but with a bit of a buzz so best to charge with the device not paired. The sound is as good as a direct connection via 3.5mm.
A1EG1AVHWM3GUJ	1	1	Get a real tripod but otherwise all other aspects of the product are an excellent value. I have sold endless watches on eBay and the pictures are a much higher quality with the photography tent.
A1EG1AVHWM3GUJ	0	0	The movie is extraordinary. I hate the Blue-ray version of the movie! Save your money... vhs or dvd better represent the original. The Blue-ray version has been butchered! Black and white movies colorized is off my list also... And would someone please tell me how to start the movie without the previews and introductions? I have no interest in the opinions of others about the movie prior to watching the movie. And forcing me to watch previews of other movies are best left to copies from Blockbuster or the theater. $2000 for a new tv, new cable box, new receiver, new Blue-ray player and it sucks! And $20+ for the Blue-ray. Fox should pay me to watch the previews. The DVD version stays and the new Blue-ray version is to be listed on eBay later tonight.
A1EG1AVHWM3GUJ	0	0	The noise drives me nuts! Too bad the box went to the trash a few weeks ago or the unit would be returned asap. Not clear if the noise is a far or electrical; unacceptable regardless.Additional info direct from the APC tech support -- the noise is a fan and the fan is on 100% of the time due to a change in design. The fan is very loud! The fan is a design change the noise is a known issue that will not be addressed. Completely unacceptable level of noise for such an expensive device.
A1EG1AVHWM3GUJ	1	1	Excellent shoe storage. The shelves are designed to fit spaces 26" to 48" as each set includes a "A" size and a "B" size. For those attempting to fit a space between 26" and 48" the different sizes is ideal; but for those happy with the 26" the different sizes is frustrating as the shelves do not fit consistently. No instructions are included. The house is older and the studs in the walls are spaced inconsistently so I mounted two 1x3 boards to horizontally top and bottom to mount the hanging rails and the uprights. Such an installation also allows for easier movement of the upgrights without further damage to the walls and without further efforts to find studs. The key to any similar installation is securing the handing rails and uprights securely and only studs or a board attached to a board would suffice. Do your homework in advance as different stores have different products and the products do work together. One store has heavy hanging rails but another store has the shoe storage and both work quite well together. The Rubbermaid web site does not list all available products.

A1EG8HN2QYXJ0R	1	1	This 3rd book in the series is just as brilliant as the other 2. Hobb's story draws you in to a totally believable world of intrigues, politics and personal joys and triumphs. I felt that the main character Fitz was so finely drawn and his character was so cohesive, I began to feel I understand him and could even have a little weep at the bittersweet ending. His relationships are a highlight of the writing. This is fantasy so good that you forget it is a fantastical world and start to except the impossible talents people have and just go with the great story.
A1EGAYFD3U671H	0	1	It shows the Joes in action displays but not the clothing in display so you can see what went with the outfits. I needed a book that showed clothing and accessories seperately and with more detailed descriptions.
A1EGAYFD3U671H	1	1	This is the best book on Vintage Halloween Collectibles! I just love all the great pictures and the descriptions of each item as well. Someone who collects vintage halloween items really needs this book for reference! I highly recommend this book! It is a must have!
A1EGAYFD3U671H	1	1	If you dont have this one in your collection of reference books you really need this! What great graphics and descriptions! I should have bought this book long ago! If you collect Vintage Halloween items this is one of the best reference books around! You wont go wrong buying this book!
A1EGC170R3BZNQ	1	1	The authors of Now, Discover Your Strengths say "Most organizations are built on two flawed assumptions about people:"1. Each person can learn to be competent in almost anything."2. Each person's greatest room for growth is in his or her areas of greatest weakness." (p. 7)They say that the best managers follow two other assumptions that are somewhat contrary to these: That "each person's talents are enduring and unique" and that the greatest opportunity for growth for each person is in developing more fully his or her greatest strength. In doing so, these managers focus on the outcomes of their employees' efforts, rather than forcing them into a particular pattern.The way to truly excel is to build on your strengths. They say that you cannot change a weakness, though you can learn to compensate for it. Furthermore, you can only excel "by maximizing your strengths, never by fixing your weaknesses." (p. 26)A strength is something you are able to do consistently and enjoy doing. Your talents, knowledge and skills combine to create a strength, with "talents" being the most important element. "The key to building a bona fide strength is to identify your dominant talents and then refine them with knowledge and skills." (p. 30)The key element of all this is the StrengthsFinder Profile, a 180-question survey. Over 30 years, the Gallup Organization interviewed two million successful professionals, asking open-ended questions about their strengths. From these interviews, the authors identified the 34 most prevalent strengths and developed the StrengthsFinder Profile, an online assessment instrument to help you identify your five strongest "themes of talent." A talent may not yet be a strength but it can be developed into a strength. The book includes a description of each of the 34 StrengthsFinder themes so you can get a brief overview of your five key strengths and read about other strengths.To take the assessment, you must buy a copy of the book or audio-book. Each purchase entitles one person to take the StrengthsFinder Profile one time. If you want to know the strengths of your staff or your friends, they will each have to purchase the book and take the assessment.One reviewer said that Now, Discover Your Strengths may be a better pop psychology book than a management book. This is probably true. The biggest thing that I took out of the book was an understanding that, to a large extent, I should accept my weaknesses and focus on my strengths and talents. I had each of my staff take the assessment so we could then consider how to best utilize and develop our talents to find greater success and avoid frustration and burn-out.
A1EGC170R3BZNQ	1	1	My mother gave us this book when she found out that we were going to adopt a little girl from China. Safely Home hit me hard on several counts. First, it provided a great counterbalance to so much we have heard about freedom of religion and expression in China. I will travel to China with my eyes open. Second, I gained an incredible appreciation for those who sacrifice all for their faith and who don't have ready access to God's Word. Finally, the author made heaven very real to me in a way I've never experienced. I have a much more vivid and accurate picture of heaven than I ever have had before.This book sometimes is a bit melodramatic and preachy but by the time I got to the end, this didn't even seem like much of a drawback. I'm not sure how Safely Home would be received by someone who did not already have a personal faith in God, or at least was close to such a faith, but believers will find it very inspirational.
A1EGC170R3BZNQ	1	1	I bought this DVD on a whim at Hollywood Video and it was just a lot of fun to watch.Yes, it's clearly a low-budget little movie but I very much liked the actors and thought the did a great job. It's a quirky movie with odd characters, most of whom are over-the-top, so don't expect subtlety. Other reviewers have criticized Heather Beers' performance as flat in the co-starring role. Maybe a little, but she is beautiful and pleasant and I'll be looking for her other movies, though I don't think there are many.As for insider Mormon jokes, I felt like I got most if not all of the humor and I am not LDS. And I did find the movie to be funny in a gentle way. I don't know that I laughed out loud but it was enjoyable and, again, quirky without being strange or stupid. I like off-beat movies and I found this one to be easier to watch than, say, Big Fish or O Brother, Where Art Thou?Finally, I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Much of the music just put a smile on my face.
A1EGC170R3BZNQ	1	1	It's been almost ten years since I read this book but I remember thinking it was simply outstanding. Unfortunately, I loaned it to a faculty member and never saw it again. Ten years is a long time in teen years, so I have to wonder if the findings are still applicable to today's high schoolers.There were a number of things that I found interesting in it. Here are a few comments and quotes from Barna that I wrote down at the time . . .Barna's six S's to describe teens:* Serious about Life* Stressed Out* Self-reliant* Skeptical* Spiritual* Survivors"By far the most pressing concern troubling teenagers these days relates to their educational circumstances. . . . The primary dilemmas related to education are getting the grades they want, getting in to the college they desire and being able to complete their homework consistently." (pp. 25-26)Four findings:1) Teens have a vague grasp of truth and morality.2) They are not familiar with the Bible's contents.3) "Many kids seem to distinguish between the concept of truth and the practice of truth."4) They are capable of living with intellectual contradictions."Only 6 out of 10 teenagers take an orthodox, Christian view of God . . . . A majority of teens (55%) believe that when people of different faiths pray to their respective gods, they are really all praying to the same central power source." (pp. 75-76) "As a general rule, modern teenagers reject any individual, organization or philosophy that claims to be the sole proprietor of goodness." (p. 79)
A1EGLGH10WNYXW	1	0	I purchased this product a month ago, and now can't imagine not having it. It is still sticks to the wall strongly. Having said that, it is on a wall of the tub that does not really get wet. It holds all bath toys and shampoo/soap neatly, keeps the bathroom clutter free, and makes post-bath clean up a snap. In addition to being convenient, it is clean, and an attractive addition to a child's bathroom.
A1EGLGH10WNYXW	0	0	I am continually amazed by how many children's books contain incorrect grammar. At this age, children are rapidly developing language skills, and they do so by repeating what they hear. In this book, the authors write: "Thomas goes slow. Slow slow slow he goes". Do writers not understand the difference between adverbs and adjectives? Or do these publishers hire incompetent writers for children? Why would anyone want to teach their children to speak English incorrectly? If you want high quality Thomas literature, I would recommend the books that are closer to the original versions by the Awdrys, rather than bastardized, badly written books "based on" the original.
A1EGNANI86USXR	1	1	I bought this book when my now-five-year-old was a baby. The food in it is delicious, as well as being healthy and filling. The veggie soup in here (the one with the seaweed) is to die for. My son loved it then, and he loves it now. As do I! Thanks for a fantastic book.
A1EGNANI86USXR	1	1	I enjoyed this book- it is a thriller, and yet it is unlike the traditional thriller that concentrates on the story more than bothering much with character development. Dunant's forte, however, is creating characters that are believable. I only gave the book four stars as I found the ending unsatisfactory.
A1EGNANI86USXR	1	1	I can almost guarantee that when I pick up a book by Richard Price that I am going to love it, and Clockers is no exception. Price's characters are real, flesh and blood humans, no excuses made. With Rocco, the detective, there is no, "Rocco knew in his gut that the kid was lying; his intuition had never let him down." With Strike there is no, "Strike was misunderstood; behind all the criminal bluster there was a heart of gold." Of course Price would have phrased it a lot better than I, not being a writer! I love that they are flawed; there is no message, no underlying morals, it just is what it is, a look of humanity at its most bleak and at its most beautiful.
A1EGWUMM1Z964V	1	1	Nice attractive cover. Vents let rain in but allows moisture to escape.So far, so good.
A1EGWUMM1Z964V	1	1	This was a replacement of an original piece of equipment that failed after many years of service. The new antenae works great. The product was delivered ahead of schedule. No problems..
A1EGWUMM1Z964V	0	0	I bought this product after my LL Bean Tec2 rain coat got soaked in Europe. The coat is quite old and was never put to the test in a severe rainstorm until I was overseas. I searched on line and discovered that Gore tex products do loose their effectiveness over time. I also found that people who experienced this type of failure suggested this product. Long story made short, it helps a little, but I wouldn't stand out in the pouring rain for long because the water does soak through after a while. Maybe it's my jacket, but for me the product didn't work very well.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	Dirk Pitt is the James Bond meets John Wayne character that every guy would love to be. Pitt's a "man's man." He smokes, but he still scuba dives with the best of them. He's no pretty boy, well-mannered and cute, but he gets plenty of women. He's no fame-seeking show off, but he always saves the day. Playboy, Maxim, and GQ only WISH they could have such a chap to plaster on their covers!Pacific Vortex! is a quick read since its a rather short book, but that's not a bad thing. A lot of popular novels contain the author's preaching to the reader or cramming pages upon pages full of verbose meandering. Not so with Cussler. Pacific Vortex is the perfect book for anyone who wants to have fun reading. Its difficult to make a novel fun (is Dan Brown a "fun" read? is Sydney Sheldon a "fun" read? are the classics "fun" reads?), but Cussler writes really fun books. I enjoyed Pacific Vortex because it moves quick - Cussler doesn't bore me by telling me every single detail about every room characters are in, what they are wearing, what they are thinking, what they ate for breakfast etc. There's a mysterious "vortex" in the Pacific? A capsule from a missing ship has been awash? Add Dirk Pitt and the story comes to life and there's not much of a pause. The ending is a bit silly (as is the villian), but good triumphs over evil, there were sexy women (but no filthy sex-scenes) involved in the storyline, and there were guns! I'm a happy reader!
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	0	Well, there are a million reviews and opinions on this book, and I guess I'll write mine. I'm told this is supposed to be an intellectual-thriller. I'm told &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; is supposed to be the next Eco or Neville. I'm told this book is somewhat controversial and speculative. Actually, I disagree entirely.I gave this novel 4 stars because it is very readable, extremely fast-paced and fluid in style. There aren't cumbersome descriptions and long-winded meanderings. The plot is interesting and the characters are intriguing. Compared to a lot of books out there these days, this one is quite good.But the ending is bad. Without spoiling the book, I just want to say that the bizarre ending really let me down. There's a fine line between suspenseful and sinister and then out and out weird and bizarre. Dan had it good until the last several chapters. By the way, this is one of Dan's trademarks; all his books have over 50 chapters, but a &quot;chapter&quot; is really only two to three pages (sometimes less). Some may find that this speeds the storyline along, in my case, I find it a bit disconcerting.Of the three people in my household that have read all of Dan Brown, all of them selected this one over his other books. Nevertheless, the media frezy seemed to be over his latest &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot; The reasons why we all selected &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; probably lies in the formulaic way Brown writes. After you read two of his books, he becomes entirely predictable where the storyline is going to go next. Not that this is bad, really, it just takes some of the surprise out of his novels. This book, while dealing peripherally with an 'intellectual' topic, is not an intellectual thriller. Its a good read, but its no classic. I imagine this story will be in movies sooner than later.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	I liked this book, a genuine like. Most hard-core Sci-Fi-ers would probably be disappointed though. Most of the storyline takes place via the three main characters' dialogue, which means there is not a lot of descriptive rambling, nor is there detailed technical workings. This is the first Asimov book I have read; from it it is clear that Aismov's a philosopher/scientist.The entire book deals with the main character's theory of "Psychohistory," which is something akin to a probability/prediction via historical generalizations. As the main character (Hari Seldon - a mathematician) wrestles with developing his theory, the book explores societal issues. The questions that are presented are relevant to learning and education, historical analysis, social & political manipulation, and the aims and purpose of scientific inquiry. However, please do not think that this is a dense book overwrought with esoteric philosophical musing. It is still a quick read. Along with "Sophie's World," this would make a great text for Philosophy in Literature courses. The text is really quite tame, PG-rated, if even that, so it would be fine for anyone high-school age and up!Some problems: the characters adapt too quickly and comfortably with new things they are confronted with (particularly words and languages). Hari Seldon, while present constantly, is still a vague and undeveloped character who says some pretty "duh" things. I think this is because Asimov creates Hari via dialogue and not description. When you finish the book, you don't feel any sort of connection whatsoever with Hari or the other characters.Nevertheless, the last 50 pages have a couple interesting "twists," which surprised me. But then, I like being surprised in books - and am open to the possibility. In general, I don't like figuring out the mystery before the main characters do.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	This was a good movie, considering the genre. I liked it a lot more than the new "Iron Monkey" and "Drunken Master." This one is not so "goofy," and by that I mean how in kung-fu movies the dubbing is absolutely comical and has over-emphasis on facial expressions and movement. Instead, in this movie, all of that is a bit tamer. Its a fun movie; the main character was well-cast as was the Shaolin Abbot.....
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	I was a bit skeptical upon first seeing this book. I worried about another floofy book about New Age/Western Buddhism. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. This book is a fairly dense "argument" between the present positions of astrophysics/quantum physics and the Buddhist metaphysics. I'm a philosopher by trade and I read a lot of popular science books (especially in physics) so I managed well with the text. However, I think it may frustrate some persons without any background. So, ultimately, unless you are somewhat familiar with contemporary physics, you might want, regrettably, to skip this one.The Buddhist in the book is a very intelligent chap, more than capable of explaining/defending his position. And he successfully presents Buddhism in a very intellectual manner. I learned a lot about the Buddhist position with regard to cosmology - which is wonderful because that's what I hoped to get out of the book. I think this book should quiet some of the stereotypes of Buddhists... and it would be most enjoyed by persons who do not draw a hard absolute line between natural science and religious practice.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	This is an example of how mysteries should be written. The characters should be engaging, there should be action and twists in the plot, and of course there should be a cathartic moment for the main character.That the author is an intelligent woman is clear from the writing style and the history that fills the background of the novel comes to life through the author's efforts. I particularly liked the good descriptions of the cities and caste system.The main character Sano Ichiro is a good solid main character - he's different than the corrupted or lazy compatriots of his class. He's got a lot of brains and some martial skill, but he fights the oppressive weight of Fate, most of the time. He is no expert in solving crimes, no expert in politics, but he has a good heart and he is motivated by wanting to make his family proud. The frustrations that he experiences come from all directions - even from those whom he thought were friendly. And, this naturally causes the reader to feel compassion for him.The villian was a bit on the slightly ridiculous side, but not so much that it made the novel unbearable. I recommend this mystery to anyone who doesn't need a lot of action to their mysteries and who likes historical novels. It encouraged me to pick up the next book in the series, so I must admit that I am well-pleased.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	0	This is not a deep read at all. But it is a really good read. I read it in a day and a half and enjoyed every minute of it. The writing style is perfect for the character that B. Eisler develops - John Rain. The main character is a cold, calculating, and aloof figure in extremely populated Japan. I have not read all that much fiction that takes place in Japan - which was one of the appeals of this book for me. And without burdening the reader with description, the scenery of the novel takes shape.Overall, the author's knowledge about Japan's martial arts is very apparent - and his ability to write about it is also quite good. Its one thing to know judo, quite another to write a fight scene. Eisler succeeds.One part of the storyline that I found a bit annoying, however, was John Rain's "flashback/breakdown" regarding time in Vietnam. This has become so utterly stereotypical and predictable through the years that I was let down at this being such an impetus for the character. And I was about to be annoyed by the events of the supporting character, a female whom Rain has a crush on, but luckily, that subplot disappears. For first effort, Eisler's book is excellent and I immediately went and got the second installment of the series. The book would be best enjoyed by those who love the rogue, aloof hero characters.
A1EH5GFTH40698	0	1	Well, this won the Booker Prize. But so what? By page 175 I realized the story was not going anywhere... What some reviewers may have termed "vivid," I found repetitive. Instead of lively and insightful glimpses into the character's lives, the book goes 'round and 'round the same tedious situations. And none of the situations are positive or uplifting.I don't foolishly think that great literature is always cheerful, on the contrary tragedy - as handed down from the Ancient Greeks -holds the highest place in literature. But this book is not even a good tragedy, it simply drags along in a hopeless and apathetic manner very much like the lives of its characters.It should not take so much paper and ink to tell us about characters who are vapid, selfish, and surly.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	I really liked this novel. When I bought it, I was afraid it might be over-the-top or very forced. After reading the first three chapters I realized I had nothing to fear - the book is a very good read. The environment and setting of the book is gently and thoroughly developed without the heavy blatant descriptiveness that some authors use. The characters are vivid and interesting.The book, as you may already know, resembles historical Japan. But if you know nothing of Japan you won't miss anything in the book. There are allusions to the samurai / ninja / ruling classes, but if you are looking for any in-depth historical accuracy, you probably will be disappointed. The Japanese-style names are fun and not too difficult to differentiate between.A lot of "Japanese" writing has elements of the tragic in it and this book nicely captures that particular aspect. Subtle and interwoven, it isn't overdone or melodramatic in any way. The reader will develop fondness for several of the main characters and the choices that Takeo faces will probably give the reader something to ponder. The so-called fantasy element in the book is barely there. There is hardly more fantasy than in your general novel. I guess what purports to be the ninja class involves the fantasy aspect, but then... ninjas are supposed to be mystical and magical to others.I recommend this book to folks who enjoy Laura Joh Rowland's novels and those who enjoy watching Avatar and Naruto.
A1EH5GFTH40698	0	1	If you haven't read this book, but you've read a bunch of the reviews you are probably thinking that this is one book that maybe you would like to skip since there are plenty of negative reviews. I gave this one 2 stars, not because of the "visual sound effects" or because of poor editing (ummm... a trademark of fantasy happens to be high-word count pastoral/medieval backgrounded tomes). I gave it 2 stars because nothing really happens in the book. Really. I think there is some "action" late in the 300's or so, but the majority of the book contains a long pony ride by the main character and his struggles with figuring out magic. (He is not alone in the struggle, as it seems both author and reader also struggle with it, too).But the book is far from wasted time. There are some really good elements that are atypical of fantasy reads. The character Lerris is actually rather unique and the reader will have sympathy for him. Most of the other characters, however, are written in the same tone - as if the author was unable to create multiple unique characters. Still, its not a tedious read and it is not a Tolkien re-tread.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	1	This book lives up to all the noise regarding the Discworld series. Its humorous. Really funny - I'm not kidding. Its a great read because of its humor and because of its zany, quirky material - it isn't predictable. Rincewind and The Tourist (& Luggage) are back again and getting themselves involved in lots of trouble.The best worst thing about the series (so far) is that it makes you want to make jokes and reference the silliness in the stories... which makes you seem insane to all your friends who have, unfortunately, not read the books! Needless to say, this one was memorable and enjoyable. Well worth the cover price.
A1EH5GFTH40698	1	0	Some readers love this book, others detest it. Its kind of like the person of the main character (Thomas Covenant) in that way. It is entirely true that Thomas says "Hellfire!" constantly and it wears on the reader's nerves. It is also true that he is a frustrating character in that he doesn't seem able to voice his feelings whatsoever and this causes some of his problems. It is also true that this book is written entirely focused upon Thomas Covenant. These reasons are enough to turn off a number of potential readers.It is also true that certain sections of the story are quite moving and emotional. It is also true that the reader does form some affinity for some of the supporting cast - e.g. the Lords. I suspect most readers will enjoy the concept of how in tune the people of the Land are with nature and health.Unfortunately, too often the author doesn't "fully flesh" out situations or reasonings - perhaps to create suspense or drama. After awhile this can be a bit tedious. Also, some of the lyrical sections get boring quickly. However, the concept of the Bloodguard is nifty and the Plains of Ra is a cool colony to visit. So, for the first book in a fantasy series, it does really well.
A1EHD4DZDMXOHE	1	1	GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, MOVES ATA AGREAT PACE. YOU NEVER SEE THIS MOVIES SLOW DOWN. THE TYPE OF MOVIE YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
A1EHDYSSAO2Y1J	0	1	If your lookin for a little somethin to get you in the mood with your signifigant other as you crawl in to bed, this aint it. The woman picted on cover is not in movie. The chicks aint much to look at, ditto with the dudes, if anything this flick will probably make the two of you want to turn off the light, roll over and go to sleep. If your just into nostalgia, the "old days", go for it.
A1EHDYSSAO2Y1J	1	1	Great movie! Story of a marine, who washes up on island who's only inhabitant is a nun, until the japanese show up! marine and nun form a friendly bond,and must go into hiding once japanese land. Then it's up to them to help U.S. forces land, will they succeed?....or wont they? Ive watched this movie many times, and it always leaves me feeing good afterward.
A1EHDYSSAO2Y1J	1	1	this is an absolutely great movie, that if your not watching with a smile on your face, your just not gettin it. I will say however, you truly want to have the version with the Bill Conti music score. I have the Dvd long version with the Eric Sierra music score (which sounds like elevator music), and besides it being long,drawn out, the shorter version with Conti score is the way to go. I love this movie so much that I also bought the VHS version cause of the music score, it just makes it so much more appealing. Treat yourself to a wonderful two hours, and watch this movie. 99.9% of you will be glad you did, the other .1%, breath!
A1EHDYSSAO2Y1J	1	1	This book is scary looking when you see how many pages are in it. Then you start reading it, and immediately all that is forgotten, as you get so caught up in the wonderful "team" of characters, each contributing in a nicely blended way to the story, and what a story!Ive owned this book for about 6 years and ive read it like four times and enjoy it every time. As soon as i read it the first time, I was very impressed with this writer caleb carr, and found there was another book written later called "the angel of darkness", which brought back the same characters although they were a little older, but the story was "fresh", with a new killer to be caught. This second book was as enjoyable as the first. You know what? I think I'll start "the Alienist" again this weekend!
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	0	0	The director thought he could fool intelligent people who know their historical facts by spending a lot of money on lavish sets, costume and cast. The movie starts out OK, but it then starts exploring Alexander's sexual affairs with a Persian enuch and how his love life affected his dicisions. People much rather expected to see more suspense, strong line exchanges between the actors, and less of Alexander's relationship with that enuch. I don't think his affair was even relevant to history. People who see historical epics are usually intelligent and knowledgable people or either deep thinkers who expect more from a historical epic. The costumes and sets were great, but the director didnt even bother to get his facts straight anout the little details like the Persian wedding (which is much more elaborate) the Greek and Persian war techniques which were much more sophisticated, and the conversations between the enemies. He didnt even get the costumes right despite their beauty. Persian war attire was very different. Instead you get to see "the sexual life" of Alexander which has no relevance to what he accomplished nor was it a relavant historical point. I could go on and on but I think you get my picture. So two stars for set, costumes and cast. Three lacking stars for the lacking history!Respectfully
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	1	0	I have to agree with the review below. The only music which can be considered "Islamic" is when people chant prayers from the Quran. This CD, like other Iranian Classical Music CDs, features no Quran chanting. Iranian Classical Singing, since the Sassanid times, consisted of singing poetry along with the music. This CD, like other Iranian Classical CDs, consists of singing poetry and the instruments mentioned below. I particularly love the way the Qanoun harmonizes with the Tombak (percussion) and the fact that, like other Iranian Classical Music, the ensemble is small.
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	1	1	The Persian (Iranian) Classical Music system was not developed upon the Arabic invasion of 7th century A.D, nor within the Safavid court. Persian music dates back to the pre-Islamic, Sassanid Dynasty (224BC-651AD)of Iran and was created by Sassanid court musicians much before the Arabic invasion. These musicians were Borbad, Nakisa, and Ramtin and created a system of 7 royal modes, 30 derivative modes and 365 melodic movements branching from the modes, one melody for each day of the year. This was the first musical system in the entire Middle East! It was known as the "Khosravani" and the "Dasgtah."The royal music functioned as court entertainment, but more importantly within religious contexts. The divine mantras of Prophet Zoroaster (Prophet of the world's first monotheistic religion) were sung within the modes as studies by www.raasti.com have shown us. Purely Iranian musical instruments are: Ney (reed flute, earliest known instrument), barbat (what Arabs call the Ud, created in Iran around 800BC), tambur (dates to around same time as barbat), setar (came after tambur), tar(came with setar but evolved to its present form later), dotar (same as setar), kamancheh(same time as barbat), gheichak, neyanban, sorna, balaban, tombak, dap (upon Arab invasion called "daf" because Arabs cannot say "p," This instrument dates back to Achaemenid Dynasty of Iran as is depicted on the ancient bass relief "Bistun") dayre, robab, and chang (harp, which dates back to 2000BC in Iran). These instruments were all used in Sassanid era of Iran through all the dynasties in between and to present day.Upon the Arab-Islamic invasion of a Zoroastrian Iran, music was banned by Arab-Islamic fanatics and later by Iranian fanatics who had converted to Islam. The music was still practiced by masters and passed down to students in the same oral tradition. Once Iranians reclaimed their rule, they brought back musical activity. The Arabic language had an impact on Parsi (Farsi) because Iranians were forced to have Arabic as an official language. Later, Parsi became the official language once again. While some words in Parsi were replaced by Arabic words, Parsi remains the same Parsi spoken during the Sassanid era alongside the Pahlavi language. Because of Arabic lone words, the musical modes were called "mayehs" or "maqam" but they were the same Sassanid modes and melodies.The art of singing poetry originated within the Sassanid Era. That's how they sung the Zoroastrian manthras within the modes. Non-religious poetry was also written and indeed sung by Borbad and other musicians during the Sassanid era. After the introduction of Islam, and by the Safavid era, Zoroatrian manthras no longer accompanied music. Songs of Islamic tales and poems by 9th-14th century Iranian poets such as Rudaki, Rumi, Attar, Khayyam, and Hafez replaced the manthras and pre-Islamic poems.The fact that Iranian Classical Music is a spiritual tool dates back to even before the Sassanid and Achaemenid Dynasty of Iran! It is strictly an Iranian view that through music, one finds God. It has been since pre-Zoroastrian times. This is why Iranians incorporated music into Islam and founded their own branch of Islam known as Sufism!Anyway, during the Qajar Dynasty of Iran, the ancient Sassanid modal system was gathered, revived and organized within a framework called the "Radif." There are 12 modes (dastgah) and 200 melodic movements (gushe). The majority of the modes and melodic mocements are from that ancient Sassanid system. But, because of the evolving nature of music, a few of the melodies were altered and a few others were added through time. The ancient compositions that were lost are because of those religious fanatics or because they weren't crucial.
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	1	1	The "ney" is a Persian (Iranian) instrument which dates back to thousands of years before Christ. It is made from reed, and the word "ney" is a Persian word that means "reed." The name for this instrument, and probably the instrument itself, was introduced into Arabic court upon the invasion of the Arabs into Persia (Iran) in the 7th century AD. It was also introduced into Turkish court upon the Ottoman Turk's invasion of Persia. Once it was introduced to Arabic and Turkish court, the name of this instrument was adopted from the Persian language into both the Arabic language and the Turkish language. The Persian style of playing this instrument is different from Turkish and Arabic styles. The Arabic-style ney music played on this CD is chilling and beautiful.A brief word on history must be made here because it is related to this instrument: When Arabs invaded Iran, Arabic became the official written language. Many Persians changed their names into Arabic names. The Arabs enforced their religion upon each country they invaded, including a Zoroastrian (Zoroastrianism: first monotheistic religion in the world) Iran, and called their declared land the "Islamic World." Iranian court musicians, who had changed their names to Arabic names because the Arabic language became the official language, composed music for the now Arab court and the Arab's "Islamic World." Thus, Arabic music, as recent studies have discussed, is the creation of Iranian court composers. It must be said that the Arabic language didn't last as the official language, and Parsi (or Farsi, the Persian language spoken from the Iranian-Sassanid era alongside Pahlavi and the official language of Iran today) became the official language once again.Anyway, The Iranian musicians, who composed music for Arab court, used a system that was created by several Iranian court musicians of the Sassanid Dynasty of Iran and was passed down to them in an oral tradition from their masters. And these masters learned from their own masters. This Iranian musical system was a complex system of 365 melodies that branched from 30 derivative modes which themselves branched from several modes. Iranian musicians also introduced this system into Turkish music. Iranian musical instruments were also introduced to Arabic countries, Turkey, and even India. It is because of Iranian musicians and the music of the Sassanid Iranians that we see the names of Iranian modes and melodies within Turkish Classical, Iraqi Classical, Syrian Classical, and Egyptian Classical music. Though these countries went their own way in regards to music, while Iran went its own way.This musical system was banned by some Arab-Islamists and by Iranian fanatics who had converted to Islam because of the Arabs. But the music was practiced and taught in secrecy. Later, during the Qajar era in Iran, the Sassanid system was revived, rejuvenated and officially re-established as the "Radif" and "Dastgah" system within the court and was used, for the first time, outside of court as well. Because of those fanatics, the system was hurt but never forgotten. There are now 12 modes (Dastgah) and 200 movements or melodies (Gushe) in Iranian Classical music. Most of these melodies and modes date back to that Sassanid era of Iran which had is responsible for inspiring the creation of Arabic and Turkish court music through those Iranian musicians mentioned above. Because of the evolving nature of music, some melodies were added along the way and some were altered. And, although the classical music of Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and Iraq were influenced by Iranian music-culture, they evolved on their own separate path and they bare their own separate characteristics. However Iranian classical music functions completely within the ancient Iranian modal system....
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	1	1	Being a Persian, I love Persian classical music. I am also a huge fan of Parisa. After hearing the samples of this CD, I new that the music would be great. So I waited patiently, until the CD became available just a few days ago through a third party seller. Fortunately, my experience with the seller was great and I just recieved my CD and have just finished listening to it. The samples are great, but wait till you hear the whole CD!! It's filled with some of the most magical pieces I've ever heard in Persian music. Parisa displays perhaps one of the most passionate of her magestic vocal capabilities in this performance. Her ornamentation is absolutely breathtaking. It was recorded in 1978, but I was actually surprised by the quality of the recording: it's really good. If you want to feel enchanted, mystified, struck with love and swept away into a whirlwind of emotion and passion, then buy this CD when it becomes available again regardless of what nationality you are.
A1EHHSOM0I7BAF	1	1	I think this is an excellent example of Classical Persian Music. The singer is indeed the unsurpassed master vocalist of Iran. The musicians are some of the best Iran has to offer. The majority of the album is performed in a rhythm-free and improvised fashion, except for three pieces. These rhythm-free sections are dominated by Shajarian's unsurpassed vocals and instruments responding to his voice.The album begins with an epic and even tragic instrumental opening which leads us into the first vocal section. Then the instruments take over again with a famous and catchy Classical Persian melody called "Dokhtarak-e julideh." Then we are taken into the second vocal section. The album ends with the vocalist and instruments all coming together to perform a rhythmic "Tasnif" or classical song.The performance is in the "Dastgah" (mode) of "Chahargah." The arrangement of the performance is the correct and formal way a "dastgah" should be executed when performing Classical Persian Music.
A1EHNYVZKVDVVN	1	1	Creative Labs has 2 excellent models. I like this one better(the T7700) because of the attached stands. But the P7800 has a better center channel (20 watts vs. 18watts). So pick your poison...
A1EHNYVZKVDVVN	0	1	This crib is acceptable. I've had for a few years now. It is somewhat inexpensive. The DaVinci Emily scratches pretty easily. Most cribs are easy to assemble and take apart. Attaching the spring for the mattress is where you generally want two people during assembly. For the price, a Graco Lauren is a better deal and I think the Lauren is nicer. My wife prefers the Graco Lauren since it has a drop side. A drop side helps when a baby gets to about 20 pounds. Lifting a child into and out of a crib is sometimes awkward, particularly when they get separation anxiety.The fact that the Emily is convertible is decent. Many cribs are convertible. Many people will have a second child. You can reuse a crib or buy another one if you live in a two story house (one for each floor). A real toddler bed will look nicer than any convertible. Overall, I like convertible cribs since they give you options.Also, don't waste you money on buying a bumper for any crib for an infant under 1.5 years old. They are a proven safety hazard despite that it makes things "look better". I'd rather not risk a baby suffocating.
A1EHSV2D6TDM6M	0	0	Probably just got unlucky, but one of the discs was completely messed up, looked like it had been in left out in sun and rain or something. The DVD titles are also pretty low budget, but a movie's a movie, and these are good films, just don't expect a classy box set kinda thing, and be wary of packaging that doesn't protect your DVDs.
A1EHSV2D6TDM6M	1	1	I've had two of these knives (lost one) and they were the two sharpest knives I've owned, both when I got them and months later. Take care of it, keep it out of the dishwasher, mind your fingers, and never worry about cutting tomatoes again.
A1EHU4MGKKVCPE	1	0	My 19 month old has been watching this DVD since he was 16 months old and he's always loved it. He doesn't find the beginning boring at all; he loves the people dressed as letters and shouts out "A" and "Z" everytime he sees them. Between this DVD, Here Come The ABC's from They Might Be Giants and Leapfrog's Letter Factory he has learned the entire alphabet and the phonics for each letter!
A1EHU4MGKKVCPE	1	1	I showed this to my son when he was 14 months and he wasn't into it, but when we watched it again when he was 20 months he absolutely adored it! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I find it incredibly annoying, and while it IS well-designed for toddlers I am with him all day and therefore I also have to watch it! He had already learned his phonics and letters from Leapfrog's Letter Factory and They Might Be Giant's "Here Come The ABC's," (much less annoying for me) but he loves this because of the mini quizzes throughout. I agree with the other reviewers that it's nice that they include teaching manners in this DVD. All in all, it's a decent DVD if you are trying to teach your child and you don't mind the format.
A1EHU4MGKKVCPE	1	1	These are Irish lullabys done instrumentally and slowed down it bit. I can't understand why the other reviewer didn't like it, unless she was looking for the songs with the lyrics. Because the songs are played a little bit slower and without words, it's the perfect background music for a baby's room to create a calm and relaxing atmosphere. It is so soothing that we like it as well, and it's so good in the background that we don't get tired of it. We have played this nightly for our son since he was an infant, and now that he's 2.5 he asks for it every night. He even likes to turn on the CD by himself before he gets into his crib. I have copied it onto my ipod so he can even listen to it at bedtime when we travel!
A1EHW56NR6AD83	0	0	This is not art, but pure elevater/soap opera type of music. I have heard these songs(unfortunatelY) when I was over an colleagues house and it almost put me to sleep. How can anyone listen to such banel trite stuff? Music should have some asthetic value, which this rates as a zero in. It is one of the reasons I don't bother turning on Mtv, VH1, or the radio, because I don't want to end up completely numb like most of our society.
A1EHW56NR6AD83	1	1	This is one of the most original bands I've heard in years! Lydia Fortner, Lyricist and vocalist for The Shroud has a beautiful voice. &quot;Where the wind goes&quot; is kind of a sad love song. &quot;Day and Night&quot; kicks ass! this band really knows how to Rock! Lydia tells it like it is &quot;You are day, and I am night and never the two will meet I was born on a dark moon night and the rain never bothered me...You and I are day and Night and you're too blind to see All you'll find in your bright sunlight is that you don't know me&quot; RIGHT ON SISTER! What I believe Lydia is refering to is how so-called &quot;Society&quot; judge people the way they look(especially if they are Goth's) and rather than wanting to get to know the person for who they really are, they refuse to be seen with them and go on their ignorant ways and spread untrue rumours about the person(s). There seems to be much ignorance in mainstream society about what constitutes &quot;Gothic&quot; and the lifestyles and people in this community, due to mass media viruses, which were spread during the Collumbine incident in April. I believe if Ms. Fortner were given the chance to appear on national tv, she could probably clear things up and help change the negative perceptions of Mainstream societys view of the &quot;Gothic&quot; scene. &quot;Roses&quot; is an excellent waltz. It should have been submitted for either &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; or &quot;Bram Stokers Dracula&quot; &quot;Prophecy&quot; would make for a killer soundtract. this is one of my personal favorites on this cd. &quot;Oh your eyes frighten me, take me back, to a moment I almost forgot I saw the darkness behind them, shining brightly Brighter than all the stars reflected to the night sky.&quot; &quot;Madeline&quot; is a song about a woman who's been wronged, but like Lydia, Madeline doesn't care what people think. The Shroud are a fine group of people, and with a person like Lydia Fortner leading the band, they are bands who are currently looking for a new direction. I would highly suggest that all of you get at least one copy of both the shroud's cd's &quot;Dark moon night&quot; and &quot;long ago and far away&quot;. listen to them everyday and as much as possible, because regardless of what the press is telling you &quot;what the next thing is&quot;, this band has the vision and is the key to the next major pop music explosion.
A1EHW56NR6AD83	0	0	I attended a corporate party recently and this was one of the cd's that was getting played. Man was I bored! I requested something more heavier and uptempo, but the dj said that Celine was a priority. The President of the company felt &quot;Alternative&quot; was too radical or political in nature, and felt that artist's like celine most conducive for this environment. It is a shame that my generation, the one that said &quot;Hope I die before i get old&quot; is actually ageing before my eyes. I guess i refuse to conform to middleage, for celine is like listening to music when you have one foot in the grave.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	An accessible history of Alexandria, and a pleasant read. Not intended for an academic audience, but nevertheless, not dumbed-down either. The chapters on Antony and Cleopatra are especially exciting. Other highlights include brief biographies of Alexandria's prominent scholars, and a detailed history of the Pharos (lighthouse).Vrettos has a nice, lucid, prose style, and the chapters are never convoluted or boring.My only complaint would be that more maps are needed, especially of Greece. I found myself digging into other books to find the locations of some of the cities and provinces Vrettos mentions. Perhaps this will be corrected in a future edition.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	I've read almost all of Saylor's Roman mysteries (save for Myst of Prophecies), and I think this one is the best. In this novel, the author turns his attention towards Alexandria, and the instability facing the Ptolemaic dynasty. We will remember from history that an unofficial Alexandrian delegation tried to reach the Roman senate (which included the philosopher Dio), only to be assassinated outside of Rome. Since the delegation was against Ptolemy, he has long been suspected. But Saylor offers a fictional alternative that will surprise most readers.The Roman poet Catullus is also introduced in this book, and Saylor does a delightful job bringing this character to life. The poet is cyncial and comical, and certainly one of the author's most memorable figures.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	There isn't much difference between 3rd edition and 3.5. Some minor rule changes and some window dressing basically. This edition came out too soon. I should say the artwork is great though.D&amp;D has gone from being a RPG to a &quot;minatures&quot; game, which is o.k. if you like lots of tactical combat and complex rules. I prefer 1st and 2nd edition which were a little easier to administer. Some of the new rules just create arguments among players, such as &quot;does this constitute an attack of opportunity or not?&quot; Other rules are way too complicated, such as turning undead. Even the saving throws have gone from a table-based design to a formula design, forcing the players to keep track of exactly how high each monster needs to role in order to evade a particular spell.The Feats further complicate things, leading to situations in which players are using virtually separate rule systems during the course of the game. For instance, if my PC has combat reflexes, he gets 4 attacks of opportunity, while everyone else only gets one.Combat takes about 3 times as long when compared to 1st and second edition.Spells are less powerful, which is o.k. in most circumstances.Some things I do like. The DC concept is good, and the skills system adds some flavor to the game.Utlimately, it depends how much complexity you want.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	House of Sand and Fog is not an uplifting movie -it is a tragedy. And true to all tragedy, the flaws in each character ultmately bring about their doom. But in addition to this, the film explores what the concept of &quot;home&quot; means; as a physical location, and an emotional effigy.Jennifer Connelly plays a self-absorbed, depressed woman, who has a history of unstable relationships, especially with men. She inherits a beach house from her father, only to lose it because of back taxes. Connelly never looks inside herself to discover the roots of her unhappiness -it is always someone else's fault. She externalizes her shortcomings, and stubbornly refuses to change. The lost beach house becomes an obsession to her, a symbol of everything the world has taken from her, everything she resolves to recover, using whatever means necessary, including manipulating a crooked cop into threatening the new tenants. She is lost, without a home, and not even content to be in her own skin. She is detatched, a &quot;foreigner&quot; so to speak, in her own land.Contrast this with Ben Kingsley's character, an Iranian immigrant who purchases the house on auction. He was wealthy and powerful in Iran -a prominant general in the Shah's military. Now he struggles to raise money by working multiple jobs, and constructing the pretense of wealth, in order to impress his Iranian friends. But more importantly, he doesn't want to lose his wife's admiration and esteem. The house for him, is the way to recover a lost life, the one he had to leave behind in Iran.Kingsley's character is a foreigner out of circumstance. Connelly is a foreigner out of choice. In a moving scene near the end of the film, the former general rescues Connely after she botches a suicide attempt, and just when the viewer thinks there may be a reconcilliation, or a happy ending, things deteriorate even more.And the house is just a modest bungalow, in need of some repair.The only thing I would change in this movie, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there is a scene where Connelly's character stands on the pier behind the house, as waves come crashing against it. She spins around in confused pirouettes, looking out into the ocean. It is in this moment she realizes there is no place for her, no &quot;home,&quot; because she has alienated herself from humanity, and brought catastrophe down on those who tried to help to her. The film should have ended right here, but it continues on, and thus loses some intensity.Perhaps the author tried to do a little too much with &quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; but a brilliant failure is always better than a mundane success.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	I saw this movie with an open mind, and thought to myself "that's it?" The entire affair screams "FILM SCHOOL." Here is the moment where we get the slow motion, heart-wrenching footage! Now we have the ironic twist, and the witty voice-overs!Granted, there are a few issues that Moore brings up that warrent further analysis, like the massive Saudi investment in the US, and how it can create conflicts of interest among politicians. But the moment the film starts getting interesting, it switches gears, and begins a long, hysterical, tirade against Bush and his Iraq policy. There are long, long, sequences, without dialogue, in which we are shown exploded bombs, and weeping mothers. I felt like I was watching something Joseph Goebbels put together. Many of the "facts" are not even accurate. The Saudi citizens in the US did not fly out under the flight ban -it was afterwards. FOX News initially said that Gore had won Florida, not Bush, the list goes on and on. The worst thing about it, is that Moore knows he is manipulating facts, and yet does so with impunity.I was also hoping for some humor. I didn't find any. I simply don't find Moore to be particularly funny. He also has a poor speaking voice. the next time he does a film, he should get an actor to read the script for him.The only reason this film won any awards is because of the politics behind it. Liberal Democrats and Socialists loved the film, but it wasn't because it was entertaining. It was boring!
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	This is the 6th edition of the BRP game Call of Cthulhu, and it is wonderfully done. The artwork is excellent, the book is well put together, and the system is elegant in its simplicity.Unlike other RPG games, this book provides the player and "Keeper" (the person who runs the game), with everything necessary to run a scenario: rules, monsters, alien technology, etc.The resistance table is a great game mechanic, and the sanity rules are brilliant. Unlike in D&D;, characters within CoC are at a disadvantage, against seemingly impossible odds, and always at risk of losing their minds! In other words, the game strives to create an atmosphere of horror and suspense.Just don;t get too attached to your investigator!
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	1	I fail to see how any guide to pizza would essentially exclude Chicago or "Chicago Style" pizza from its pages. The author raves about east-coast pizza, specifically the New York region, but virtually ignores Chicago. In an interview he recently said Chicago pizza was like a "cassarole", and expressed his dislike for anything deep-dish.Chicago has the best pizza in the world, period. If you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes or Little Caesars, go to New York. A New York style pizza joint wouldn't last 2 days in Chicago, where people have come to expect excellence, heaping toppings, carmelized cheese covered crust, and tangy sauce. Some restaurants in Chicago even buy their meat from the top butchers in the city, places where a filet would set you back $35.I lived in both New York and Chicago, and believe me, the crap they serve in New York isn't pizza, it's carboard with cheeze whiz on top.The author even talks about pizza in Connecticut and Arizona. Huh?This guy doesn't have a clue.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	There is an obvious Brian Eno/ Harold Budd influence here, but I have to say that the efforts of "The Dead Texan" (and "Stars of the Lid" their other project) are even superior to the work of their predecessors'. The music gives the impression of vast tracts of empty savannah, mist-enveloped foot hills, and torrential rainfall. It is lightly punctuated with human voices and sound effects (rain, footsteps, etc.) and true to the ambient form, it emphasizes the space around the music as much as the music itself. Ideal listening involves a good stereo system in a large room.The DVD contains music videos and various works of art from Christina Vanzos. The selection "Aegina Airlines" is especially good. Christina's art is almost minimalist, and blends well with the music.There is nothing "overproduced", noisy, or chaotic about this album. It is dreamy and precise. A terrific accomplishment.

A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	This game wasa) A let-downb) A total rip-offAt $50 and a $15 monthly charge, I had high expectations. Instead I get a weak, first-person shooter disguised as a RPG. My main beefs:1. Combat system is horrible. Monsters jump around in real time, and half the time you can't target them. Trip, dodge, etc. don't work and are useless.2. Spells are difficult to cast in combat and the interface is clunky and bug-ridden. I frequently had to exit the game to get inventory problems worked out.3. No solo adventuring -save for the "practice adventure" in the beginning.4. Monsters make no noise -for $15 a month, I expect to hear a Goblin grunt!I've purchased many video games over the years. This one will go into a special shrine entitled "worst game ever purchased."The game is absolutely mindless, with no story line, and no sense of atmosphere.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	The 6th edition hardcover is a handsome book, filled with huge amounts of information. The method employed in this book is different than other instructional texts; it presents you with a vast number of grammatical rules early on, and then forces you to translate. It is a baptism by fire, and can be pretty challenging.However, the reading selections are delightful, many taken from Roman authors of the first century B.C. There is even some Horace to keep you on your toes.One thing you will need to do, is get the answer key from Harpers, since not every exercise in the book has one. This wasn't a problem for me -I simply emailed the publisher and they sent me the answer key. I had it within 4 days. If the key was included in the text, it would be 100 pages longer at least.If you are studying Latin, I also recommend the book "501 Latin Verbs" as another resource. If you are brand new to the language, you may want to start with the Cambridge Latin course, units 1 & 2, and then read the Wheelock's.

A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	I recently purchased this machine to play on my 5 month old Dell Dimension E510 with 1GB of RAM, dual-core processor, and 256MB video card. Nevertheless, the game is choppy and doesn't run well.This is probably due to poor programming, and one should realize that these problems were in another game (Temple of Elemental Evil) by the same company.To run this game correctly, you are going to need a high-end, possible server-class machine with a 768MB video card ($700), dual-processor (add $500), and at least 1.5GB of RAM (add another $200-300). So if you are willing to throw $1400 in upgrades into your machine, or purchase a new machine for $4000-5000 you are good to go.The game is massive and took hours to install. Downloading the 80MB patch from the Internet took an hour in itself.So word of warning. The game will not run on 98% of computers out there. Don't waste money thinking you can run it -you can't.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	V for Vendetta is ostensibly an action movie with political overtones. What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a "hip" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.The main character "V" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution. Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings. Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she "believes" in his political endeavors. All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder. It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes. At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference. In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal. The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester. Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film. It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on "Animal Farm." And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.So take a comic book and turn it in to a movie using the director that gave us the tower dung-heaps called "Matrix II & III." Some movies are provocative and disturbing in a good way -V for Vendetta is not one of them. [...]
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	1	1	I got this game for Christmas, and I am amazed at the level of depth and complexity. The game captures the essence of medieval warfare and politics, as players are forced to go on crusade, crush peasant rebellions, marry off their princesses (and princes), contend with religious movements and heresies, and control their economy. Unlike some other reviewers, I haven't had problems with the AI. The graphics are solid, but you will need a pretty powerful system (but nothing like Neverwinter Nights II).If you like mass-combat games, you'll love this one.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	1	I've used Linux (Red Hat, Slackware, Mandrake), Windows, and Mac, and I can honestly say that Linux, in all its incarnations, is still highly problematic, and not ready for general consumer use.There are a number of problems with this product:1. Too many distributions (flavors) means hardware incompatability and application incompatability problems. Application A will work on Red Hat, but will not work on SUSE. Scanner B will work on SUSE, but not on... you get the picture. Sure, you can rig it up to work, but most of us don't want to spend 2 days re-compiling the kernal to get a cheap scanner to work on our system.2. Support is given out on a volunteer basis (unless you pay for it). Unless you are a UNIX/Linux expert, others in the "community" won't even talk to you, and will probably kick you off their message boards. Linux users don't talk to new users. They don't want people using Linux -it is their little private club.3. Limited or non-existent USB support. You will have to browse the web for some tool for a workaround.4. No games -at least major games that have been out in the last 5 years.5. Very few multimedia applications.6. Installing applications can be a nightmare, as you eneter "dependency hell." The app needs 13 componants, all of which need to be downloaded from different websites and installed in a specific order.This being said, Linus has its uses. Mostly as a back-end, enterprise database or email server. It is NOT a desktop OS. Red Hat has dressed it up to look like one. When you find yourself typing 700 lines of code to get your camera to work, you will discover that it is a patch job by a bunch of amateurs.Go with Mac OSX if you want a stable, secure, powerful, OS with multimedia, and UNIX utilities.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	I'm currently using this for a freshman English course, and I find it is a complete mess. There are historical mistakes (claiming Cicero was the greatest writer of the Roman Empire -when Cicero wrote during the Republic), spelling errors, and even grammatical errors (take the title of Chapter 4 for instance: "Types of Synthesis: Explanatory and Argument" -has the author ever run into the term parallelism?).The book is full of redundancies and proprietary terminology. Some of the concepts are barely explained, others are beaten to death. The writing style is not consistent, leading to the suspicion that many people had their hands in this one -perhaps "authors" in India. Some of the exercises are barely comprehensible. For instance:"Look over the preceding readings and make a list of the ways they address the overall topics of computers, communication, and relationships. Make your list as detailed as you can. Then write several lists grouping together the readings that deal with similar aspects of the overall topics" (108).We really don't want our students writing like this, so the last thing we should do is expose them to a textbook like this.Some of the reading selections are good, and others are vapid, pointless, and generally worthless. Essays about dirty dorm rooms and lack of parking spaces behind the gym -oh yes, this is really provocative.I challenge anyone to find me a worse textbook.

Bad move on my part.When the program downloaded my State of Louisiana tax forms, I got a script debugger error. After filling out the forms within the program, they would not print out correctly. The completed forms came out as gibberish. According to the help files, this is due to a missing font -which is incorrect. I have the correct fonts.So after buying the software, I had to completely redo my state taxes. There was no way to download the forms a second time -it can only be done once.

I have not been able to get the compatibility pack to download for Macintosh and the word on the street has been that Microsoft is ending support of Apple products.So if you want a whole lot of frustration and angry end-users, purchase Office 2007. Otherwise stay with what you have or get OpenOffice (or NeoOffice for Macintosh).

After a somewhat counter-intuitive setup, I got it to work with the Canon, but it wouldn't work with the HP Laserjet 1012--which is a very common laser printer. I tried different drivers, configurations, settings, etc. The printer would either print gibberish or fail to print altogether.The product doesn't include software to work with Apple computers, but it would be possible to set a printer up through Windows and share it out to the macs.I returned this and bought a Linksys printer server that worked fine with the HP printer.Unless you are very technical and want to work through a frustrating setup, avoid this one.

The addition of a Linksys wireless network adapter card caused 3 different Vista installations on 3 different platforms to blue screen.2. If the Windows Update via the Internet is interrupted, the system becomes corrupt (happened twice), requiring a total rebuild. This is BAD!3. After a successful Windows Update, Vista required me to register and validate the software a second time.4. System performance when running various applications (including Office) decreased by more than 60% due to memory management issues.5. A Toshiba thumb drive simply wouldn't work under Vista--how this can be is beyond me.6. In order to play various games, such as World of Warcraft, you need to operate under an account with Administrative privileges--this is an obvious security risk.7. Upon losing the network connection, the user has to manually restart the connection--Vista will not repair the network connection. This is something I have never seen before. Even Windows 3.11 knew how to repair a broken network connection.8. A great deal of software (including various Adobe applications) do not work under Vista. Same problem with games. Neverwinter Nights 2 will not work under Vista depending on your hardware configuration. From what I have read and tested, I would estimate that 75% of existing software will not work under Vista, or will experience problems.I could go on and on, but needless to say, Vista is an unmitigated disaster for Microsoft and the public. Their CIO was recently fired for reasons "unknown," but one has to speculate that it had something to do with the failure of Microsoft's new flagship OS.Save your money. Stick with XP or buy a Mac.
A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	0	0	The setup was not difficult, and the server works generally well for my XP machine, but there is no Macintosh support. I shared the printer on the XP machine, but Mac still can't print to it--I get the error "unsupported personality:PCL" all day long. The product does not include software for the Macintosh.It is also expensive for what it is--a single port print server. Other users report problems with Vista.So you are better off buying a wireless printer. Lexmark makes these, and they support remote Macintosh printing. However the all-in-one models do not support remote scanning from a Macintosh, so beware.

A1EI34OT729PRA	1	1	The reason that education reforms are so muddled and anemic is because most people have no idea how we arrived at our current condition. Consequently, many people consider the abolishment of the U.S. Federal Department of Education to be an extreme measure, when actually it would be mere tinkering at the fringes. This is strange since, historically speaking, the current structure of public education is a recent experiment in social-engineering wrought over roughly the past century to century and one-half. West's invaluable contribution is to unearth the origins of public education and its original claims. The first edition examined the British ontogeny, which is also important since the American ontogeny paralleled it in time and argument. Be sure to get the later editions which specifically include an eye-opening look at the American evolution. If you only read one book on education in your entire life, read this book.
A1EI34OT729PRA	0	1	Bellesiles' argument that Americans in the days of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett disdained firearms and his methodology for asserting this were obviously suspect, as evident from even the brief reviews (I heavily annotated my Economist review). This did not impede an initial shower of praise and awards for the book and Bellesiles wielded his prestige as political power to file an amicus brief in a federal gun control trial. ...the book likely will remain prestigious to the usual suspects. If you would still like this work on your bookshelf to impress certain sub-species of intellectuals and book fanciers, I recommend gluing the pages together as a safety device, especially if you have children in the home.
A1EI34OT729PRA	1	1	This book is a bit dated by riding the 1980s fad of American declinism but not in the way most critics suggest. Kennedy did not help himself by his 1987 cover which showed Uncle Sam stepping down to make room for a rising Japan. However, many critical reviews apparently resulted from pontificators looking at the cover art and neglecting to read that stuff between the covers carefully. Although Nye (1990) later argued that US declinism was exaggerated by an unwarranted expectation that the US should retain its unnatural post-WWII apex, Kennedy himself suggested this 3 years earlier. Kennedy's &quot;rise and fall&quot; is not only boom and bust but also tidal ebbs and flows in relative power over time. Long before Nye, Kennedy described recent US &quot;decline&quot; as a return to its &quot;natural&quot; level and emphatically stated, &quot;this reference to historical patterns does not imply that the United States is destined to shrink to the relative obscurity of former leading powers such as Spain or the Netherlands, or to disintegrate like the Roman and Austro-Hungarian empires&quot; (1987 p.533, Kennedy's italics). Kennedy merely stated that the US could wane if it didn't mind itself.Theoretically, Kennedy took a systemic view over the &quot;long cycle&quot; to argue that broad patterns of financial and economic development (the primary independent variables, in academic jargon) determine the ebbs and flows of relative power (p.xv-xvi). For instance, he argued that although a US defeat at Midway in 1942 certainly would have altered the next year of the war, it would not have affected the final result (p.353). This is a systemic explanation which downplays the roles of individuals in the long-term. Fans of individual level analysis can take solace in a greater role for individuals in the short-term, and of individuals' ability to navigate within systemic constraints (p.540). Nonetheless, theory is not the strong point of the book. For instance, his attempt to explain the &quot;constantly upward spiral&quot; of the West as due to the innovation caused by competitive quarrels among small, European kingdoms and city-states, in contrast to the expansive unitary states of Asia (p.xvi-xvii), is troubled. Not only could one dispute the monolithic Asia characterization, but his reason does not explain why the warring American city-states did not result in Mayans, Aztecs and Incans as permanent members of the UN Security Council. His Europe-Asia dichotomy appears to be a difference misconstrued as a causal explanation.Instead of theory, the strength of this book is as a history. For instance, it shows that the majority of the world's manufacturing output was produced by the &quot;Third World&quot; as late as 1830, at which time per capita industrialization in continental Europe was closer to India's level than to Britain's level (p.149). Remember the other day when you couldn't quite recollect the exact figure for the Dutch military budget in 1622? This book would have saved you (it was 13.4 million Florins (p.69)). Even if many of the measures are estimates, I feel compelled to like a book which tells me the energy consumption of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1890 (19.7 million metric tons of coal equivalent (p.201)) or the per capita income of Bukovina in 1910 (310 Crowns (p.216)).
A1EI5CE0810OQQ	1	1	I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. I enjoyed it so much that I was moved to purchased the sheet music for several of the selections so that I can learn to play them myself.The only reason I didn't give it a full five start is because I can imagine that there might be a CD somewhere out there that I might enjoy just a little bit more. I very rarely give either the highest, or lowest, rating in any situation. However bad, there is almost always something worse, and however good, there might well be something better.Buy it and enjoy!
A1EI5CE0810OQQ	1	1	I hardly know where to begin.The book itself was a dispassionate, insightful, and meticulous dissection of the superstitious dogma of the anti-scientists who would condemn human civilization to ignorance and credulity.I come away from this reading with a sense of frustration, and some sadness, that our intelligent and well-trained scientific intellectuals are imposed upon to waste their valuable time debunking such ludicrous foolishness. Their time would be better spent studying the intricacies of our natural world and applying the knowledge derived therefrom to making life better for all people. It is, after all, the scientific understanding of evolutionary principals that help bring about the medical and pharmacological advances that make our lives healthier. Belief in fairy tales has never helped these endeavors. It is, furthermore, the understanding of evolution that has benefited farming, food production and animal husbandry to better help us feed the burgeoning billions who live upon this little planet. Except in fairy tales, superstition has never helped here either.I can only hope the contributors to this work derive some measure of amusement, some entertainment from exposing, step by tedious step, what should be obvious to even the most mediocre of intellects. Namely, that primitive superstition and archaic religious beliefs do not describe the real world in any useful way, or with any degree of accuracy.
A1EI747QFG8RK2	1	1	I purchased this product to replace a 5 year old Braun model. Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of every Braun product that I have owned and this shaver is no exception. Though it takes a day or two to get used to, it performs very well and delivers an amazingly close and comfortable shave. In my opinion, it performs much better than my previous Braun shaver and is much less irritating to my skin. All in all, I think this is an excellent product and have not found any fault with it. I hope that it gives me 5 excellent years like my last Braun.
A1EI747QFG8RK2	1	1	To be fair, I have been a fan of PS Audio power conditioning products for some time. Though I am not a fan of their power or audio cables, in my experience, their power conditioning products present great values. I started by adding a Soloist to my family room system. Immediately, the blacks on our Pioneer plasma became better and the depth of the picture improved noticeably. The soundstage from the Theta amplifier really expanded and the audio became more dynamic. From there, I added a soloist to every room where we have electronics. In the theater room, we use one for the front end system (processor, amp, powered speakers) and a separate Soloist for the projector. Although I may be biased, the results are very impressive. Adding a Soloist to our bedroom TV improved the picture of our 6 year old Sharp LCD TV to such an extent that I forgot why I wanted to get rid of it in the first place. Even if you have a separate power conditioner, adding a Soloist to your system will bring about noticeable improvement in both sound and video. A very impressive product. PS Audio discontinued the product. Rumor has it that the Soloist was cannibalizing sales of their larger, more expensive power conditioners. It really is that good!
A1EI747QFG8RK2	0	0	this concert may not be your cup of tea. The arrangements for this performance are very different and, in my opinion, Sting leaves out some of his records. This is not your ordinary Sting concert. Buyer beware.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	0	0	I brought a pair new, mainly due to quite a few positive audiophile reviews. However, I am extremely disappointed. The speakers sound unclear and muddy. It is worse than my old $200 Boston Acoustics bookshelf speakers, which were replaced by this pair.The only thing I can say about audiophile reviews - you are going to waste you money if you believe them.Audiophile quality, right...
A1EID2DBIURVUD	1	1	Outstanding album; Great songs and great performances by Bette Midler; I believe it will go down history as a true classic.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	0	1	Maybe it is a good album for these newage or jazz fans, but it is not a good album for children. This album is rather bland, and have a quality of strong resonance. It makes the sound unclear and dark, and hard to listen to.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	0	0	Its sound quality is worse than all the headphones that I have ever used (more than 20 at least). You are better off with a headphone that comes with such things, say a CD player.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	0	0	I have owned a pair of Infinity Beta 20 for 4 years, and I am not a happy owner, not at all.First, the good ones - their high frequency reproduction is pretty good, and they do have little resonance.Now, the ugly, they have very poor mid-range, it is muddy and unclear, at any volume level. This is especially apparent for low pitched vocals. Just how bad does it sound? Well, my $15 Altec Lansing desktop speaker sounds clearer, and I paid $400 for them.Because of this experience, I have lost confidence in Infinity speakers. The C.M.M.D. is more of a marketing scheme, than real benefit.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	1	0	I used to think average headphones can beat most loudspeakers, well, until I've got the Boston Acoustics VR3. Now, only my $100 Shure earphone is clearer (but bass is not as good), and the VR3 has beaten all my other headphones (including a really good neo magnet monitor headphone).The VR3 is exceptionally clear from top to bottom. I actually changed it to 3-way active crossover tri-amp configuration, which removes the harsh distortions introduced by passive crossovers. Before the modification, the VR3 already shows its amazing talent. After the modification, it is a knockout!With the VR3, I am now rediscovering that my "bad" CDs are actually pretty good - I was fooled by poor speakers and headphones for so long - and VR3 is a true revelation.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	1	1	If you are not familiar with the deposition process, then get this book first. I don't see how you can get a better education for the price of this book.
A1EID2DBIURVUD	0	0	If you need to spend a lot of time to make a product work, then it does not work, period.This is worse than garbage, for garbage, I throw it away, but this thing wastes lot of time, before I throw it away.
A1EIPS6D0ZZ4UA	1	1	This is a really good deodorant without all the harsh chemicals that are in most deodorants out there. I have been using this deodorant for a while and I must say I'm very pleased with this product. It goes on the skin clear and the smell is fragrance free which is good. I must say that this deodorant is a product that i plan on purchasing over and over again because it is such a good quality deodorant.
A1EIPS6D0ZZ4UA	1	1	One of Justin Timberlake best CD in my opinion. From start to beginning, the CD is really good and the beats are nice in a lot of the songs. Definitely a must buy if you are a J.T. Fan.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I was prepared for more of the same, based on the fairly lame books that came out of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. But this exceeded expectations by a wide margin. The story is much better, the characters are deeper and more interesting, and the writing style is very crisp and entertaining.If you're wondering how Lucas could make the whole "Anakin descending to the dark side" thing believeable - well, it is. Anakin's gets a key motivation to take the dark side seriously, and the motivation is only a little bit of a stretch.Other high points - the humbling of Yoda at the end was very satisfying, and the evolution of Obi Wan is extremely well done. The battle scenes sound terrific. The resolution of what happens to the droids is well handled.Not-so-high points - the books does not go into the Wookie revolt in any significant way, and I understand that this is an important part of the movie. Amidala is not really in the story very much, though her role is key. And there's still just a whiff of "how could Anakin possibly be that stupid?"But all in all, far fewer flaws and far more to like than the previous two stories. I'm counting the days until May 19 to see this story on the screen. If this book is any indication, this should easily be the best of the second trilogy.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	For those who have listened to Porcupine Tree before, the best description I can give of this album is that it regresses a bit from In Absentia back towards PT's more traditional style, and so becomes a blend of both. It has a bit less energy and more melodic focus than In Absentia, and there's a bit less stylistic variety among the songs.All that said, it's pretty good, and I recommend it to anyone who like energetic progressive rock. Certainly, the Porcupine Tree style, which depends more on guitar than keyboard, is distinctive in the prog rock space. It has some of the energy of, say, Dream Theatre, with real live drums instead of a machine (which I really appreciate). But there's more discipline here, and finer detail on the sound engineering. That avoids Dream Theatre's major fault (in my view) which is a tendency to drift into metal for the sake of metal. I cringe during those highly-metallic sections of Dream Theatre works, and I never find myself doing that cringing with Porcupine Tree. I also hear more variety here, as the sound style varies all the way from smooth Pink Floyd-Alan Parsons uber-engineered sound all the way to a dash of grunge garage rock.I think Steve Wilson's compositions also do a good job of avoiding the lame lyrics so common in prog rock. Again, no cringing here, as I might cringe over the loopier stuff in, say, Glass Hammer.If you're new to Porcupine Tree, you really ought to get In Absentia first. It's superb. But if you already have it and like it, you probably should get this too. The title cut and the fourth song, "Halo", will sound stylistically similar. The third song, "Lazarus", is this album's bid for some radio airplay, and so is the softest song on the album, but is pretty good even with its dash of commercial influence."Arriving Somewhere But Not Here" is the longest work at twelve minutes, and begins with a section that harkens back to Porcupine Tree's earlier works - I find it initially reminiscent of the stuff on the second disk of "Stars Die". It then naturally evolves towards PT's more recent style. It's one of those songs that probably won't grab you when you first hear it, but gets better with repeated listening."Mellotron Scratch" replicates that same pattern in about half the time, starting soft and then building. Not bad. It's followed by the song that I thought sounded most like it would have fit into In Absentia - "Open Car".The list finishes with some filler cuts. None are objectionable, but none really stand out either. "Glass Arm Shattering" is in that group, and really goes back to earlier styles. If I had to pick the best of this group, it would be the hidden track "Shesmovedon".I don't expect this one to last on the top of my play list as long as In Absentia did. But it's there now.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	Perhaps it's because Card knew exactly where he needed to be at the end of this book, but it just worked for me better than the last two. There's less outright war, and more political manuveuring than the last two books. The political machinations are more complex, yet somehow more believable this time around.That plausibility might be a result of seeing the Battle School characters as human and therefore potentially flawed. In previous "Shadow" series books, the Battle School kids were all good guys, except for the cardboard cutout villian of Achilles. It fell to the other characters, mostly politicians, to display human fallibility.This time, the Battle School grads have serious character flaws of their own, and these flaws lead them into big mistakes. They also get into more and better conflicts with each other, which enriches the dynamic of the book.Characters are nicely done - a particular strength throughout Card's books. The tragic Bean, the acerbic Petra, the enigmatic Alai, the dashing Han Tzu - all are crisply drawn. I never, ever get characters confused with one another in Card's books, and certainly not in this one.The character development of Peter Wiggin is especially well handled. We already know from the very first Ender book (Ender's Game) that Peter becomes a beloved leader, and that Ender writes Peter's "obituary" as the second part of the his book The Hive Queen and the Hegemon. Now we get to see the other side of that story, including what Peter did to arrive at that point and how he was induced to get Ender (of all people!) to write his unvarnished life story.Not everything is tied up into a neat little package. The matter of Bean and Petra's children is handled well, but I wouldn't call the end result "neat".The open-ended matter of Bean's children leaves enough room for a sequel, I suppose, if Card decides to go that way. But I'd be happy to just leave the story here. The adventure of the Battle School grads is pretty much resolved, and we are caught up to events mentioned at the end of Ender's Game.If you've read the other three "Shadow" books, then you absolutely owe it to yourself to get the full end of the story by reading this one. If you liked "Ender's Shadow", but got bogged down in the other two sequels, I'd recommend giving the series another go just to finish off with this very satisfying completion.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	Combine classic Heinlein with some Joe Haldeman and Larry Niven, and you might get something like "Old Man's War". Coming from me, that's high praise indeed, since those are three of my favorites.It's been a long time since I started an SF book and couldn't put it down. But I read through this book in an evening, unwilling to go to sleep without getting through it.Combining challenging ideas, good character development, and clear, coherent prose style seems to be impossible for most current SF authors. So it was a big surprise to see all three of those in a first novel. This novel flows easily, without the awkwardness or irrelevent fluff of, say, Greg Bear. The ideas are interesting and sometimes surprising, without being weird and hard to imagine as in far too many contemporary SF novels.The hook at the beginning is that only someone who's 75 can go into the armed forces. Since the main character, as well as the others he meets early, are all aged and have various degrees of infirmity, it's obvious that they will have to be restored or augmented in some way before they can fight. But the armed forces don't tell these folks how that's done, so the book begins with the mystery of how 75 year olds can become part of an effective fighting force. That mystery is cleverly solved (with a solution that reminded me of something Niven might produce), and then the action begins.The fighting is violent and harsh, much like you would see from someone like Haldeman, but not gratuitously so. The novel is much more about the implications of the way the oldsters are "augmented" for the armed forces.I have to agree with a couple of other reviewers that the ending was sudden and a bit pat, but I have to say it was not the way I expected it to end two-thirds of the way through.This book is obvious Hugo/Nebula material, especially compared to much of the dreck currently produced. I don't think it ranks with the all-time best (novels like Mote in God's Eye, Ender's Game, or even Starship Troopers), but it's very, very good. If you are yearning for a refreshing dose of more classically styled SF, this one is definitely for you.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	It helps to read a book like this if one's expectations are properly set. This simply is not a stand-alone book. It is the set-up for the final book in the series. As such, no one should expect it to have a satisfying, uplifting, all-loose-ends-tied-up ending, and it doesn't.What it does have are (1) good continuing character development on the main characters in the book, (2) at least one totally unexpected twist, (3) reasonably brisk pacing, especially compared to Order of the Phoenix, and (4) additional depth on the wizarding world and other aspects of magic.As others have noted, the adolescent romance scenes can put one's teeth on edge, but is that really outlandish? Who among us was suave and smooth during our own first explorations into relationships with the opposite sex? Personally, I don't see where the Ron-Hermione thing come from, but I've seen more inexplicable pairings in real life.You have a couple of strategies to choose from. First, you can read this now and gnaw over the unsettled fates of most of the main characters and the tragedies in this book until book 7 comes out in 12-18 months. But if you just can't stand being in suspense that long, then DON'T READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW! Wait until book 7 is released or imminent so that you can read both together.But don't complain that this book leaves you feeling unsatisfied. That's exactly what it's supposed to do. I'm glad I've read it now, because there are many interesting things to think about pending the release of the last book. And, given what I've read about the process Rowling went through in crafting the series, I have confidence the last book will make up for the unsatifying nature of this book's ending.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	There's plenty to like in this movie, but also some things that just didn't come together. Let's start with the positive.The action scenes are superb. These are best Jedi battle scenes yet done, and all of them have fantastic detailed visualizations as a backdrop. The entire movie just feels incredibly rich in visual detail, in fact.A fully CGI Yoda finally looked completely natural in this movie. In re-watching the original trilogy after seeing this, I found myself wishing that Lucas would go back to the old movies and insert a CGI Yoda. It is that much better.The conclusion brings the entire series together. The parts that concerned Padme were a tad bit rushed, but otherwise there was little to criticize. The minimalist treatment of the transformation of a burned Anakin into a helmeted dark lord was completely different from the rest of the movie, and somehow struck exactly the right chord. The rest of the ending is extremely well done - the bequesting of the children and the droids, the scenes on the Bail Organa's ship (which is the first ship seen in episode 4), and the tie-in of Qui Gon Jinn.But not everything was ideal. Lucas just doesn't write scintillating dialog, but then we all expected that. The biggest flaw to me was the unconvincing final conversion of Anakin to the dark side. It's just too easy to ask yourself "How could he be that stupid?", and that spoils the so-called willing suspension of disbelief that a movie needs.The political scenes were rushed, probably because the movie was already too long and the youngsters in the audience don't care about such stuff anyway. But I missed them - they were handled much better in the book.The scenes between Anakin and Padme worked only a bit better than in Episode 2 (where they bordered on silly). Hayden Christensen just can't seem to bring off the romance scenes.With the superb visualizations and the connections of the old trilogy with the new, this is a must-have for Star Wars fans. For casual viewers, it may not be worth the money, but for those of us, who grew up on Star Wars, it's a vital part of our DVD collection. I'm looking forward to getting it on November 1.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	The pair (Winds of War plus War and Remembrance) are must-read books for anyone who wants to understand World War II. Following a military family through the pre-war years up until Pearl Harbor, Winds of War sets the stage and covers the early war in Europe in detail. War and Remembrance then picks up after Pearl Harbor and gets all the way to the victory over the Japanese.Artfully using characters that have a plausible reason to be in important locales for the war, Wouk combines the family's story with military analysis (by a fictitious German general) to give a complete story. It's amazing that he can work so much that's relevant to the war into a drama about fictional characters.The novel gives you a sense of the military and geographic factors that drove the war, the logistic and economic factors, and the psychology of the leaders of the great powers. But you're also treated to an understanding of the spirit of the times. Younger readers especially will begin to understand what it was like to live in an age very unlike the modern world, and one in which mortal threats were commonplace.I recently reread Winds of War after a twenty year gap, and enjoyed it even more this time. I feel that I know the characters even better the second time through, and better understand their predicaments and the choices they made.I only have only one quibble about characterization. One of the characters, a Jewish wife to one of the military family, is the on-scene witness in Europe to Germany's treatment of the Jews. While I think that material is very important, the series of circumstances that keeps her and her uncle in Europe seems a bit contrived to me. But I'll give Wouk a little license. The book would have not been complete or nearly as powerful if it had left out a complete understanding of the Holocaust, and if it took a little contrivance to get two Americans to witness those events, I consider that a worthwhile trade.If you've seen the TV series and liked it, you really ought to get the complete picture by reading this book. I've given it as a gift to friends for years. I used to pick up copies I would see in used book stores so that I could give it to folks I thought might be interested.Unfortunately I ended up with no copies except one very old falling-apart one, and bought a recent printing of the paperback. The quality was not as good it should be, probably because this book is over a thousand pages and they cut some corners on production. I have to wash my hands after each reading because the print smudges off the book. So if you can afford it, you might want to get the school/library binding version instead. It's more than twice as expensive, but I expect it's of far superior quality. I'm probably going to pick up one of those myself. This pair of books is one that ought to be displayed proudly in any thinking person's library.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	A rollicking good time from a movie that is well worth getting on DVD, because you'll want to watch it several times. It's tight, with no wasted scenes, and moves along an action story quickly while interjecting some of the funniest scenes in animation history.The voices are well-nigh perfect. Among Pixar's underrated strengths is the ability to get voices just right. The Incredibles family, especially Holly Hunter, all sound like someone you might have as a next door neighbor. Jason Lee as Syndrome deftly bounces back and forth between being the over-the-top Bond villian type and being the creepy guy you knew in high school that nobody wanted to be around.And, of course, there's Edna Mode - the funniest animated character to be invented in forty years. The filmmaker himself, Brad Bird, takes on that voice, and based on these results he's got a second career voicing animated characters if he decides to go that way. Edna creates superhero costumes (didn't you ever wonder where superheros get their costumes?). While discussing a new costume for one of the Incredibles, watch for Edna's insistence on "No capes!" along with a video litany of superheroes whose capes got tangled in propellers, snagged on rockets, or something similar that caused their demise. I always thought capes were kind of stupid for superheroes, and obviously the film's creator Brad Bird shares that assessment.Being a fan of the old Flash DC comic, I liked the son Dash. Other characters are obviously inspired by comics such as the Fantastic Four. But this movie is a send up of all those influences.The spirit of the movie is captured best in one scene, in which the villian Syndrome starts a solioquey outlining his plan for world domination exactly the way every hackneyed Bond villian has ever done, and then pulls up and says, "I can't believe it! You got me monologging!" This movie never takes itself too seriously, and that gives it the ability to combine action with comedy.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	In Camouflage, Haldeman postulates two very different aliens. Both can blend in with humans. One retains its innate bloodthirstyness for thousands of years. The other starts out utterly amoral, but while relating to humans, it eventually develops emotions, eventually achieving a sophisticated and benign morality.Both are attracted to an alien artifact, but for different reasons. We can tell early that the result will be conflict. But as others have stated, the setup for the conflict is carefully drawn while the resolution is over quickly.But I found the resolution pleasing enough. It avoided any melodramatic touches such as gratuitous battles or sermonizing.Haldeman has been known to stretch an idea a bit too far to get a novel out of it (see "The Coming" for an example), but not this time. And he continues to wring new implications out of SF staples, such as alien contact in this case.This is very much in the traditional vein of SF, with no touches of fantasy, cyberpunk, or other more recent styles. If you like straight-forward SF, you'll probably like this. It's not a classic, but it will keep you engaged, and perhaps even make you think a bit about the nature of morality.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	0	0	I'm in general agreement with other reviews, with one major addition.Comfort is not exceptional. I've used these on a transatlantic flight, and I could only stand to wear them about four hours. My ears became too sore after that. I had some Seinheisers before that did not have that problem.Sound quality is marginal, but it's about what I'd expect from noise cancellation headphones in this price range. Ditto for the noise cancellation. The set folds up pretty well, but not nearly as nicely as expensive sets such as Bose.In short, there are no outstanding reasons to buy this set. But there's one reason that makes wish I had not. I'm tired of putting those silly ear pads back on.The first one fell off the third or fourth time I used the headphones. I worked hard to try and get it back on exactly right. Then the other side fell off shortly thereafter. Now they both fall off with regularity. I'm way past trying to get them back on with the edges property tucked in because it's not worth the fifteen minutes it takes every time. Now I just slip them on, and know that they'll fall off again in two or three wearings.I'm thinking of super-gluing those pesky suckers on. I think that's the only way they might stay for a while.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I've been using the E260 for about five months now, and it has been one of the better purchases I've made on Amazon. Sounds good, easy to use, fairly durable, reasonably priced, and it even looks good.One of my teenage son's friends checked it and said he liked it better than the Nano. I agree with him that the Sansa wheel is better. It's more "sure-fingered" and I rarely pick the wrong thing with it.The menus are natural, and quick to use. I often change music while moving on an elliptical exercise machine, with no problems.It coordinates reasonably well with Windows Media Player, so it's unnecessary to install any other software to use it. I can't say the integration is natural or perfect - it took some dinking around to get Media Player to copy over just the music I wanted. But I found a way I like even better, which is to access the device directly and just drag over the songs I want using Windows Explorer. The Sansa apparently just indexes them on the fly when I do that, because they appear in the menus right away. (The integration with Media Player was one of the main reasons I picked the Sansa, because I think iTunes is pretty sad, and the Zune doesn't work with Media Player either.)I can't claim the included ear buds are anything special, but that's true of most MP3 players. Maximo makes a nice set of ear phones (Maximo iM-390 In-ear Earphones 2.5MM 2FT Alloy Metal + Case) specially tuned to the Sansa E-200 series, so I recommend you take a look at them if you want some high quality audio off the Sansa. Or just wear some decent, lightweight headphones.This unit is now a pretty good bargain, and you can bump it to 6GB by getting a 2GM car for about $30. But if you have a lot of music, you might want to spring for the 8GB model, the E280. I've filled up my E260 already, but I carry about fifty albums on it.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	0	0	I got these headphones to use during exercising. Their compact, foldable design makes them a pretty good choice for that, and the current Amazon bargain price was acceptable. They're also comfortable enough for that use.However, the sound reproduction is mediocre indeed. It's muddy, and lacks definition in the high end. There's over-emphasis on the bass, but it's not the thumping bass you may be expecting. It's indistinct and fuzzy.I compared them side-by-side with my desktop headphones, which areSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series, admittedly a higher-end product, but the difference was quite dramatic. For a product that claims to be a "reference", the JBLs are disappointing. I may use them at the gym, but I won't be using them anywhere else.If you really want good sound, or even decent sound, you should look elsewhere. If you just want something better than earbuds for your MP3 player, then I guess these will do.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	This is one of the better alternative history books I've seen. It certainly gets the atmosphere of Elizabethan England right, based on other books from the period that I've read. And it only requires one historical twist, which is that the Spanish Armada succeeded instead of failed. That results in an occupation of Britain by the Spanish, and a "resistance" into which William Shakespeare is drawn.From that starting point, good research by Turtledove is evident in the characters and their roles. I was particularly taken by Lope de Vega, who in the real world was a prolific Spanish playright almost as well known as Cervantes. Lope de Vega really was in the Spanish Armada, so his presence in occupied Britain makes complete sense. Based on biographical notes I checked on the web, his character in the book is extremely well drawn, particularly regarding his penchant for the ladies.The book has pretty good pacing, and a very satisfying ending. The only thing you might struggle with is decoding Elizabethan dialects. Turtledove really works at getting those right, but as a result I needed to re-read several to parse out the meaning. But I'd say that's all just part of the experience.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	0	If you're accustomed to heavily padded American-style athletic shoes, you may not like these. They are lighter weight than typical Nikes or New Balance, and depend on shape instead of padding to provide support. That also means they take a bit longer to adapt to your foot than shoes that are padded.But I've had a pair for a couple of months, and liked them enough to buy another pair to put on the shelf. I like the lighter weight, and the shoe has gained in comfort as I've worn it. I wouldn't run any marathons in these, or even do heavy workouts, but for day-to-day knock around shoes, I like them.They have one big, big advantage over other shoes. That micro-perf-whatever system that is supposed to expel moisture from the shoe apparently works. These don't get as hot as other shoes, and after two months they have no trace of objectionable odor. I have another pair from Geox that is a different model, and they have no odor after almost a year.So don't buy them to work out in, but if you want something reasonably comfortable and stylish for casual Fridays, this is pretty good choice.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I finally got tired of dealing with my last set of headphones,Philips HN 110 Folding Noise Canceling Headphones, because the earpads kept falling off. I was ready to check out high-end noise-cancelling gear, and I knew exactly what I was looking for: good noise cancellation, comfort, durability, easy to travel with, and good sound quality.I saw a consumer roundup in Wired Magazine that rated these over the Bose, so I checked out both. I listened to the Bose, both the QuietComfort 2 and the QuietComfort 3. Both sounded great, with a slight edge to the QuietComfort 3. But these Audio-Technicas sound pretty much as good as the QuietComfort 3 and better than the QuietComfort 2. The sound in the Audio-Technica is a wee bit brighter than the Bose, so if I just had to pick the better sound quality, the QuietComfort 3 would win. But the difference is close to indistinguishable.And then we come to the strengths of the Audio-Technicas. Price obviously takes first place - these babies are only a bit over one-third the price of the Bose. Given the ease of losing or breaking the headphones during travel, that's no small consideration. I could buy a spare pair of the Audio-Technicas, and still be ahead!But I also judge the Audio-Technicas as more durable, and slightly more comfortable. The comfort is important on those four hour plane flights. To be fair, I've never tried the Bose headphones on such a long flight, but I don't see how they could be any better in the comfort department.The Audio-Technicas keep up with the Bose by having a very nice case, and the usual accoutrements. I like being able to unplug the cord completely from the headphones, for situations where I only want noise cancellation without music. The cord has its own nice little pocket in the case, so no more wrapping the cord around the headphones they way I had to with my old ones.I would be happy to have the Bose if someone gave them to me, and maybe they would satisfy me more in the long run, but I'm not willing to pay almost three times the price to find out. I'll take these instead.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I used these boots as my casual shoes during a ski trip to Utah this year, and they surpassed expectations. They stayed dry inside even when I waded through snow.They are above average comfortable for hiking boots, and look good. They give good traction in mud or on snow.They're light enough to use for knock-around shoes too. I've used them on a trip to an amusement park, and various athletic events. No problem, and as with all the Geox shoes I've owned, they don't develop odor like other shoes, presumably because of the micro-pore thingy in the sole.One minor quibble: I wish they stayed tied longer. The shoe laces are a bit slippery, and unless you double-knot, they will slip loose in two or three hours.If you are accustomed to athletic shoes, you may be expecting more arch support. The arch support in these is only fair, but I found it acceptable.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	0	0	The initial install experience was good, and I like the form factor.Unfortunately, after less than six months, devices plugged into the hub began behaving erratically. Mouse pointers would jump all over the screen, my SmartPhone couldn't get a consistent connection to synch, etc. The same devices plugged straight into a USB port on the computer worked fine, so it was definitely the hub that went bad. It had the same power source as everything else, so it's unlikely that there was an external cause such as a power surge.I'm now shopping for another hub, and I won't be getting another one of these.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	In my review of the book on which this DVD is based, I mentioned that the whole left-brain, right-brain dichotomy is an oversimplification. Yet, it's still a useful model. Some people are better at procedural, logical, analytic activities, while others do better at induction and pattern recognition.The thesis of A Whole New Mind is that we need both. The original book makes a comprehensive case, including exercises for left-brain-leaning folks to give their right sides a workout.If you think this might have some validity, but it all sounds a bit too touchy-feely for you, this DVD can help you quickly get an introduction to the basic concepts. In about an hour, Daniel Pink covers the basics of his ideas, and he does so in a very nice, engaging style. I'm a professional speaker myself, and I recognize good work. His presentation skills are quite good.Then if you are intrigued, I'd encourage going on to the book, which will take a few hours to digest, and you might end up investing quite a bit more than that if you like some of the suggested exercises.I got the DVD because I liked the book and knew some colleages who would probably respond better to the video. I wasn't disappointed; I've recommended it to several.One thing I didn't mention in my review of the book - going through these concepts was stimulating and fun. I read a lot of books on design and user interaction (because that's part of my work), but they're usually pretty dry and it's a chore to get through them. But both the book and the DVD did a good job of meshing interesting concepts with fun ways of thinking about them.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	First, let's get something out of the way. The whole left-brain, right-brain dichotomy is an oversimplification.But the human brain is so incredibly complex that we need useful models to think about it, and left-brain vs. right-brain is a useful one. There really are two different general classes of brain activities, with procedural, logical, analytic processes in one class, and inductive, pattern recognition, and intuitive processes in another. Everyone uses both kinds, but some people lean more on one or the other class for their work and daily life.The main point of the book is that we are leaving an era in which left-brain-leaning knowledge workers are the high-value workers with secure careers. Procedural work can be automated or outsourced. It's much harder (perhaps impossible) to automate design, emphathizing with users to discover what they need, and seeing abstract patterns in complex venues.However, pure right-brain thinking is not enough. Ideas have to be validated and weighed in cost-benefit terms. So those who will thrive in the new world, according to Pink, are those who effectively use both sides of their mind. That's where the book's title comes from.Working in the software world, I see the effects of left-brain-leaning thinkers, because most software developers fit that description. Ever wondered why most software has a horrible user interface? Software developers don't tend to be good at the kind of thinking required to get inside the mind of users (empathy) and figure out what they really need and like, or to come up with brand new patterns of user interaction to fit new requirements.But software is changing. New technologies allow more visual feedback, which then requires more and better design skills to use those technologies. The Internet world is highly complex, so seeing patterns and responding to them is important.The book isn't specifically about software, but I kept getting ideas about the software world from the concepts discussed in the book. That's why I kept scribbling in the margins.I even went back through the book a second time just to capture in a separate document the various ideas that flowed while reading the first time.If you're an "idea" person, I think you'll like this book. If you're a left-brain-leaning knowledge worker, I think you owe it to yourself to think about how to exercise and develop more of your right-brained capabilities. The book has lots of useful exercises for that.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I have been using this keyboard on three computers for about three years now. I find it perhaps the best I've ever used in terms of ergonomics and feel.As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is "F Lock Key Eliminator".The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.All in all, this is a pretty cheap way to find out if you like ergonomic keyboards.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	In a society that's been prosperous and mostly safe for decades, it's easy to lose sight of the depths of violence and depravity that are possible in humankind. This is a great antidote to that problem. In this series, you will see battle after battle that's horrific: Poland, Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, the Italian campaign, D-Day, Battle of the Bulge, and many, many more. You'll see the gruesome details of Hitler's drive to Holocaust, and in fact those episodes are probably the hardest to watch in the series. They are gritty, real, and terribly, terribly tragic.It's also important to realize the value of standing up to those whose main motivation is attainment of raw power. As horrific as WWII was, this video series begins far enough in advance of the war that you can see the paths not taken, which would have frozen Hitler in his tracks before he gained the territory, resources, and confidence of the German people to launch a war that killed a hundred million people. Those who always believe in the magical power of negotiation need to see the vivid proof that it isn't always the answer. Sometimes standing up to thugs is a painful but necessary alternative, no matter the cost.WWII was too big to get even into a series this long. I find the war in the Pacific gets short shrift, which is probably not surprising from a British production company. Britains own trevails get a deeper look. But those are minor flaws.They don't take away from the virtues of the production: lots and lots of real video shot during the war, detailed interviews with survivors on both sides, and a well-written narration by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, who puts forth the exact tone needed, mostly tragic, but other times matter of fact or even occasionally whimsical.I had my teen sons watch this when they were around 13 and again a few years later. I know of no better resource that simultaneously illustrates both the horror of war and the regrettable necessity of some wars because the alternatives are even worse. I watched it with them both times, making that three viewings for me counting the one when it originally came on TV. It's worth it.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	These have a nice, thick cotton fabric, and are very well put together. They are fairly loose fitting, as you would expect from a work shirt. They have a very soft and comfortable feel.The pocket is nice and sturdy, and has a small leather patch (about 1.2 x .6 inches) that furnishes a perfect place to clip in an ink pen. The front has two buttons, and the top one makes the neck quite snug. I usually leave that one unbuttoned, but in cold weather, it would be helpful.I got two, the forest green and oatmeal heather. I do a lot of airplane travelling, and these are perfect for that. They keep me warm on the flight (that air at 35,000 feet is always cold), and the pocket gives me a place for an MP3 player or whatever needs easy access in those narrow airplane seats. I also wear them as my daily knock-around shirts in fall thru winter. They're even nice enough for casual office settings.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	After losing my ultra-simple, twelve-year veteran coffee maker last year, I've gone through a couple of modern ones. They all had timers to start the coffee in the morning, auto-shut-off heating pads, and other checklist-oriented features. Only problem is, neither of them lasted very long, and neither was particularly easy to use and clean.This thing makes a virtue of simplicity. It's not a computer with coffee-making capabilities, it's just a coffee-maker. It doesn't even have an auto-shut-off, which leads to one of the few cautions, because you'll have to get back in the habit of shutting off your coffee maker if you get this one.On the plus side, it's very easy to load. The filter basket fits right inside the carafe, so it's easy to access. The reservoir is beautifully designed to lift out and take to the water source, and nicely marked so you can measure in your water. Then it slips right back into place in the body, and you're good to go.Cleaning is easy. All the parts that need cleaning are collected together right there in the carafe. Just get them to the sink, rinse them, and that's usually enough. If you've let the carafe get dried coffee in it (say, because you forgot to turn the machine off...) then the carafe is easily cleaned with soap and water because it has a nice, wide opening.The brewing process is reasonably fast, and the coffee is of quite acceptable quality.A couple of other cautions are in order, however.First, this thing only holds five cups (the usual coffee-standard 6 oz cups) in the reservoir. Then you'll lose the usual few ounces to wet the grounds, leaving only a couple of generous talls. So it's really suited for singles or couples who don't drink very large amounts.Second, the basket doesn't really hold the quantity of grounds I normally use to brew five cups. I prefer strong coffee, and I have to dial back the amount to four or four-and-a-half cups to match the maximum amount of coffee I can put in the basket before it starts spilling over the filter.However, I'm sticking with this little fellow. It doesn't take up much room, I love how easy it is to clean, and it's so simple that I'm really hoping for some long-term reliability. If that doesn't pan out, though, I'll be back to let you know.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I've used the Snowball for several months now, primarily for Internet training videos shot withCamtasia Studio Version 7. I'm very happy with the quality and consistency of the voice narration over my screencam videos. I did some without a pop filter, which came out reasonably well. Then I added a pop filter (Gator Cases GM-POP-FILTER 6-Inch Double-Layered Split Level Pop Filter (Black)) and got even better results, with a nice "broadcast" feel to the voiceover.Setup is as easy as everyone says. Just plug it in and it works. Be careful, though, if you have multiple microphones, especially if you have a laptop with a built-in mic. Installing the Snowball does not usually change the default mic on your system - you must do that manually. In fact, I found that Camtasia has a bad habit of reverting to the built-in mic as the default if I start it without the Snowball plugged in, and then it doesn't automatically revert to the Snowball when it is connected. So be careful that you check to ensure that the Snowball is the default when you begin recording. (This isn't really the Snowball's fault, but you might be fooled into thinking that you're getting sub-standard results from the Snowball when you're really using an inferior, built-in mic.)A minor annoyance for screencam capture: the Snowball needs to be a bit to the side of the monitor so that you can see the screen, and so it needs to be carefully positioned at the correct angle to catch your voice in the cardioid mode. Since you're probably looking at the screen and don't want to turn and face the mic as you talk, you won't get quite the full force of your voice with the Snowball. This isn't a problem with headset mics, which can be ideally positioned during screen recording. However, I think the quality of the Snowball audio more than makes up for this annoyance. If you are doing a lot of this type of production, you might want to look at finding a way to raise your monitor so that the Snowball can be positioned directly under the center of the monitor. I tried that once and got slightly better results.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	Would you believe that it's a pretty funny movie for a casual evening's entertainment? If you like Mel Brooks style slapstick, that's exactly what it is.These folks took a page from the Mission:Impossible crew on how to translate an old TV show to a decent movie:1. Have a decent budget for a good script and good effects.2. Hire some A-list actors.3. Respect the things that made the original special.4. If the theme song is a recognizable, well-composed classic, keep it.I'm not really a fan of Steve Carell, but he's pitch-perfect as Maxwell Smart. His deadpan delivery is spot on.I am fans of Anne Hathaway and Alan Arkin, and they both turn in good efforts. I've like Anne since The Princess Diaries, and Alan since he captured the enigmatic Yossarian in Catch 22 (forty years ago!).Ex-athlete actors can be a risk for pushing the cheesiness factor too far, but Dwayne Johnson does reasonably well here. His entrance is quite funny, and even though his character is supposed to be a prima donna type, he never hogs the spotlight.Terrence Stamp is an underappreciated talent - the Christopher Lee of his generation, as far as I'm concerned. He's the ideal choice for the super-villian Siegfried, and has the line in the movie that made me laugh hardest:Siegfried's assistant: Too bad about all the dead movie stars.Siegfried: Yes. What will we do without their razor-sharp political advice.The original series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, and they were brought in as consultants on this effort. I think this helped get the right feel for the characters, not to mention the running jokes from the original series ("Would you believe...", "Sorry about that, Chief.", "Missed it by that much.", Etc.), which are not overdone and generally integrated nicely into the dialog without being too forced.There are some flaws. A few scenes do go on too long. The "get past the criss-crossing lasers" scene and the chase scenes at the end are the best examples.Seriously, this isn't a top-ten all time comedy. But it was funny. I'm sure some don't like the slapstick, and it is quite easy for slapstick to slip over into cheesy and boring. But I don't think that happens here.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	My first mouse was the original Microsoft mouse with green buttons, way back in 1985. Since then I've used several dozen from a bunch of manufacturers.When ergonomic mice began to come along about ten years ago, I immediately switched to them. I was developing a bit of wrist strain in the right hand from many, many years of mousing, and all the ergonomic mice helped allevaiate that for me by rotating the right hand to the outside, putting less stress on the tendons going through the wrist.This mouse has the very best shape of any mouse I've ever used. I've never had a trace of repetitive strain with it. It feels extremely natural in the hand - much better than the 6000 V2.0 mouse that has come along to replace it.In addition, it tracks well and works wirelessly just fine. The receiver is corded, and isn't one of the small USB dongle-like receivers, but I prefer that because I can position the receiver close to the mouse.Battery life is quite good. I use this thing a lot, and I only change batteries about once a year.It has one drawback. The area for the thumb is quite comfortable because it has a gel layer which the thumb sits on. However, every one of these I've used (three so far) have eventually begun leaking gel around the thumb. That typically happens after about two years of use.It's possible that this problem is more likely for me because of the way I hold the mouse, and the fact that I do some gaming with it. Gaming is rough on a mouse because of the tight hold and violent movements one tends to do. However, it's been the main factor that has forced me to buy a new one every so often.I just ordered two of these to put on the shelf because I'm not sure how much longer they'll be available after the release of the V2.0. As you can see from the reviews on the V2.0, users rate it lower than this one, and I certainly agree. I hope Microsoft relents and keeps this one, or makes some future version a lot more like this than the V2.0.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	The bane of cooking pancakes, crepes, grilled cheese and such is uneven heat. I was astounded the first time I cooked grilled cheese with this pan. I'd never seen such even browning, even with less butter than I normally use.It's also pretty durable. I normally use non-metallic implements, but I've used metal turners several times with no problem.It's easy to wash. The non-stick works well, and it has no places for tough-to-get food to stick.I even use this for bacon and eggs, though it takes special care not to have something fall outside the pan because of the shallow sides. As you might expect, it cooks bacon very evenly. It's also ideal for omelets because of both the even cooking and the shallow sides which make flipping the omelet easier.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	This is a decent ergonomic chair, and better than you'll find at most office supply stores.I've had it for a month now in my sunroom office, and after a Tennessee summer, I can tell you with confidence that the mesh design is comfortably cool to sit in. Other pros:- It's quite easy to put together, and takes about five minutes. Do be careful, though, to insert the arms into the proper channel in the attachment area. It's easy to insert them wrong if you are not paying attention, and you'll know it because they will bow into the seating area. It's not hard to remove and reinsert to make them correct.- It has exactly the most needed adjustments to adjust it to your needs (with one caveat I'll get to later): height, back tilt, seat tilt, arm height, and arm horizontal positioning.- It rolls easily.- Even though the arms are not padded, they have a nice shape for resting your forearms on.But it's not perfect:- The seat is rather firm for my taste. You had better get the height and seat tilt right, because otherwise the firm seat will cut off circulation in your thighs.- It doesn't go quite as high as I'd like. My last chair went over an inch higher.Overall, I'm satisfied enough to sit in it until it wears out, though I may get a supplementary gel layer cushion in the seat both to raise it and to deal with the too-firm cushion. I wanted a Herman Miller, but I just could not swallow the price on them, and I'd say this is 80-90% of the benefit for 1/4 the cost.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I do week-long classes for ten to fifty people. That's enough to degrade just about anyone's voice without amplification. So I've used a portable PA in my larger classes for a couple of years.I also have theBehringer Europort EPA40 Handheld PA System, but it's bulky, heavy because of a large built-in battery, and doesn't have wireless built-in. With the bulk and extra wireless equipment needed, it was only practical for trips by car.This unit, however, is small and light enough to fit into a large suitcase. Batteries are optional, so I don't transport any. That leaves room inside the unit for the power cord and plug.The included wireless mic is pretty good quality, and goes for about thirty hours on a single 9 volt battery. Absolutely no issues with setup or tuning - turn everything on, adjust the volume, and you're good to go.It's also pretty good about avoiding feedback. Sometimes in a class I'll walk in front of the unit without thinking, and it doesn't squeal until you get within two or three feet of the front.You don't want to be playing music through this thing, but for voice amplification to medium sized groups, it's a great fit, especially for the price.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I have two pair of zip-up boots, both with relatively flat original insoles. I got one pair of these Polysorb insoles for the least comfortable pair,Timberland Men's Earthkeeper City Side Zip Buckle Boot. They really, really helped make those boots tolerable, because the original insole was quite thin and didn't have much shape in the heel area.I liked them so much, I got a pair for my other boots, which had been tolerable until I found out how good the Polysorbs were. The other pair wasRockport Men's Parkridge Zip Boot. Their original insole wasn't too bad, but this is definitely a step up in comfort.I wear men's 8 1/2, and these insoles fit like they were factory installed. After trying some Dr. Scholl's 3/4 length that just refused to stay put, these are now my first option for a pair of shoes that doesn't have the comfort and support I want.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	The strong points of this book are excellent research and discriminating choice of famous retorts and comebacks. You'll see the well-known ones you expect, from wits such as Winston Churchill and Calvin Coolidge, but also a host of witty remarks from lesser known personages.I'm serious about how good the research is. I had wondered for years about a story concerning a retired engineer called in to fix an intractable problem. I had heard many variations, most of them with no details. This book identified the particulars: it was Charles Steinmetz of General Electric who famously sent the $10,000 bill, itemized with $1 for a chalk mark and $9999 for knowing where to put it.The introductions to each bit of repartee are OK, but they don't come off so well contrasted with the conciseness of the repartee itself. There's a fair bit of detail on the people and situations involved. Sometimes it helps accentuate the wit. Other times it seemed a bit superfluous to me.Overall, though, I recommend it. If you're a speaker looking for funny stories, you'll likely find a few. If you just like clever use of language, you'll find plenty of it. And it's a great book for a guestroom nightstand when you're done with it.
A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	1	1	I've been using this unit for over a year during technical classes. I have two laptops that I must use, and this switch allows them to both be connected to the projector. Instead of moving the one projector cable when I need to switch, I can just flip the switch on this box.I have had no trouble with the signal. However, this isn't a premium product, and it shows. The switch has become a bit loose. I have to wiggle it to get it to engage the B position. Also, the screws on the VGA ports were not as tight as they should have been. One came loose, and I had to open up the unit to fetch it from the inside of the box and reattach it.So call it three and a half stars. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and bumped to four stars because it's pretty cheap. I don't really expect premium construction on such a product.As another reviewer noted, you need three cables for this thing to work. However, whatever projector you use will probably account for one of them, so I travel with two cables for this box, one for each laptop connected to the A and B ports.Do be careful with it. The edges and corners are a bit sharper than you might expect. Not enough to be really dangerous, but I would not want to swipe my hand against it accidentally.
A1EJSQ0PZQAFKR	1	1	While everyone has their own taste and surely will not like the work of every author included, there is something here for everyone that is a Middle Earth fan. Most notably I find the work of Ted Nasmith, John Howe, Alan Lee, and Robert Goldsmith enjoyable. A big bonus as a fan of the History of Middle Earth and the Silmarillion were the images from those times by John Howe and Roger Garland.
A1EJSQ0PZQAFKR	0	0	I love the scifi genre and was looking forward to watching this series. It is very well produced and looks good, but that doesn't overcome the horrible acting or the incomprehensibly bad writing. If a show decides to take itself seriously (as this one clearly does), then there needs to be a high level of consistency within the story as well as coherent story lines that maintain the integrity of the story line. The story is chock full of holes, the acting and writing is campy and I find my self saying "who writes this crap" regularly during each episode. The story lines force most every character to be ignorant, foolish, or both (because none of the plot-advancing devices would work if the characters were not idiots) and treats the viewer as if they are 12 years old and have no grasp on human behavior or character. Perhaps that was the target age group. Few, if any, of the characters behave in a consistent fashion with their role or are consistent from episode to episode. The story fails in just about every way possible. It isn't riveting, there is almost no action, those in the military don't behave as if they've spend more than a day in training, petty infighting and lame superstition-based narratives replace what should be the focus of the stories (struggle for survival related to direct and indirect effects of their mortal enemy). The Character of Gaius Baltar may very well be the worst written, acted, and actualized character in the history of television. Rather than focus on any of the endless possibilities at the disposal of a scifi show, the story focuses on petty politics and shallow, inconsistent characters. The flaws in the story lines are too numerous to list and rife throughout every single episode to the point of distraction....assassins shoot their targets in the stomach, stomach wounds are referred to as chest wounds, and apparently the spleen is located in the chest...if just goes on and on. Just a horrible show.
A1EK0SWZ4JON11	1	1	Gotta love fabric, a thousand times better than plastic for durability. The flexibility is the main selling point for me, they stay on no matter what. The entire box has only one size(which is perfect), a full one inch wide on the ones I ordered, they can't be beat at this price!
A1EK0SWZ4JON11	0	0	While the construction is ok, the ball would rarely show an answer. Shaking it would only show the edge of two sides 90% of the time. It was hardly legible when an answer made a rare cameo appearance. Nothing to see here folks, keep your money, plenty of other quality items here on Amazon to spend hard earned cash on.
A1EK0SWZ4JON11	1	1	This thing is built like a Sherman tank! My kitten crawls up it all the time, and scratches to his heart's content.One minor complaint:The top of the post comes out too far, and is very slippery so he hasn't made his way onto it.
A1EK0SWZ4JON11	1	1	I sure can pick 'em, this is the best pencil I have ever owned. Extremely fluid writing with very little effort, it fits perfectly in my hand! Will be getting all my pencils from Pentel from now on, though I believe this one will last for many years.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	0	I wanted the original movie on DVD, and that's what I got. It doesn't bother me that it's not anamorphic. It doesn't bother me that it's letterbox.I gave it 5 stars because I'm rating THE MOVIE, *NOT* the TECHNOLOGY. To paraphrase Shakespeare, the story's the thing.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	0	I knew of this book long before I read it, and when I finally sat down *to* read it I was completely enraptured. Here was a fantasy novel very unlike anything I had read before.This is not a fairy-tale in the happily-ever-after Victorian style. This is a fairy-tale more in the vein of how fairy-tales were originally written, many of them with ghastly endings which served as warnings. Keep this in mind, as well as the book's historical context and you won't be disappointed.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	0	0	While this book is certainly a far cry from 'traditional' when compared to most fantasy novels, the stilted and extremely choppy writing style, along with the rambling plot left me clueless as to how it could have possibly won the World Fantasy Award. There are far better books out there.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	1	This review has a twofold purpose:1) To demonstrate why I believe most of the reviews of this book are either misinformed or ignorant about the nature of this book. I say this because it strikes me that the reviews with which I disagree are judging the book as if it's a novel. It is not, and I seek to demonstrate why it can't be considered a novel, and why basing a review on the standards one would use for a novel is misguided at best, and certainly unfair.2) And finally to explain my rating of this book.PART 1 --First, when I picked the book up and looked inside, I could tell it was, at best, a short novel. There was lots of white space on every page. One Amazon reviewer criticized the book, saying it was "double-spaced". But why should this detract from the story's rating? It's the story you're rating right? Not the typesetting! Jeez! In fact, how a story is typeset is intended to make the reading experience a more pleasurable one, as well as to save the publisher money in printing costs. It's a delicate balance between the two.Second, it was originally a serialized story, published in 15 installments in THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. I am told it is a novella, which would put it at 20,000-40,000 words, maximum! The form known as a novel starts at 40,000, with most modern novels--regardless of genre--in the range of 90,000-120,000 words. (Fantasy novels are one of the more obvious exceptions which exceed those lengths.) Thus, AT RISK is at least one-half to one-third the length of a typical Cornwell novel.Third, it is therefore completely unreasonable to expect a novella to have the complex character and plot development found in a full-length novel, and this is why I think so many of the reviews are either misguided or unfair. Given its length, to expect otherwise is to have unrealistic expectations. Given the shorter story form, character development MIGHT seem skimpy, the story itself might also seem incomplete, but neither of these is true about AT RISK.The fact is, AT RISK ***IS*** a complete story, despite the complaints of some. ALL the parts of a complete story are there! As a writer, I know the parts. I've written complete stories in less than 100 words. I've also written complete stories in 7,000 words, 12,000-15,000 words, and longer. My point is simple: the character and plot development in this story are quite sufficient when you factor in the story's length.Some reviewers said the style was choppy. I didn't think it choppy. It could be argued that it seems choppy because it reads like a serialized novella (which is, I think, a reasonable criticism, but none of the reviews I read made this qualification). For myself, I thought the story's style rather reminiscent of hard-boiled crime fiction, the sort found in the old pulp magazines. Dashiell Hammett-like, or even Raymond Chandler-like, and I enjoyed it. (Even Stephen King-like, if you're familiar with THE COLORADO KID.) Was the story hard to follow? Hardly! It definitely wasn't award-winning prose, but it was certainly more than competent. Better than the majority of other things I've read, and most certainly better than John Grisham!PART 2 --Why only 4 stars? District Attorney Monique Lamont, one of the main characters in the book, came across as a little too unbelievable. I'll admit to not knowing much about rape victims (which is what Lamont becomes during the course of this story), but the woman was definitely schizo (whether schizophrenic, or schizoid, or schizotypal, or schizo-whatever, I don't know). Perhaps some rape victims do act this way (and if they do, then my judgment on this point is definitely off), but something about how she was characterized just didn't work for me. Otherwise, I thought it a good story.One of my favourite characters in the book was Nana, the grandmother of investigator Winston (Win) Garano. She was likeable, offbeat, into the supernatural (especially occultic sort of things), and would give hell to anyone who mistreated animals.In my opinion, there's no reason whatsoever for anyone to avoid this book! Simply realize that the length is shorter than Cornwell's norm, and thus the story's form is different from what you might be used to.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	0	1	I purchased this book because the main character, Odd Thomas, sounded very intriguing. Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to its promise, in my opinion.Chapter 4 began... "I see dead people." And that remark was followed by something along the lines of "But, by God, I *do* something about it." The problem with this is that it immediately raised the spectre of comparisons to M. Night Shyamalan's movie THE SIXTH SENSE. This was a bad thing. While books and movies are completely different mediums, and while I understand *why* and *how* they are different, one of the few things they *do* have in common is the intended audience's reaction to them. Due to some personal experiences of my own, Shyamalan's movie had me spooked for weeks(!!!) afterward. But ODD THOMAS? I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start reading Rowling's latest Potter novel. In other words, ODD was forgettable.While Koontz did a passingly good job of planting Odd's psychic magnetism early on in the story, its use at the end of the book completely deflated the story of any buildup of tension. Odd didn't seem terribly worried about the horrific things he believed were going to happen, so I wasn't worried. Odd move. Bad move! Therefore, low ratings.

A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	1	I'm not a fan of buying a new OS when it first comes out. I'd rather wait until most, if not many, of the bugs have been fixed. My iBook came with OS X Jaguar (10.3.x) preinstalled, and had been upgraded to 10.3.9. When Apple came out with Leopard (10.5), I took the plunge and bought Tiger (10.4.x), and now my iBook is running on 10.4.11, and I've experienced no problems whatsoever. This laptop (12" screen, 1.2 GHz PowerPC G4, 768 MB DDR SDRAM, upgradable to 1.2 GB) is a couple years old (purchased in 2005), and, obvioiusly, uses the old PowerPC processor, but is quite capable of running Leopard should I choose to install it. However, I'm content to run on a slightly older OS, such as this one, knowing that the majority of the bugs experienced with it have been ironed out. My only real complaint so far is that it took an incredible amount of time to install, but it has worked flawlessly ever since. RECOMMENDED!
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	0	I purchased this TV for use in my home office, since I tend to watch most movies in that room. When the TV arrived, it did not work out of the box. I had no problems in reaching a person at Toshiba's help line, but I quickly found out that I could not return it for a new TV, which was incredibly frustrating. Instead, I had to register the TV, then take it to a Toshiba authorized service center for repair. Because this happened just before the Christmas season, the length of time for the repair was a little longer than it would've been otherwise. (A seasonal thing, obviously, so I can't fault anyone for that.) The gentleman at the repairshop was able to diagnose the problem right away, but indicated that the part had to be ordered. Basically, the TV would turn on, and I could get audio, but no video. I also was not able to access any of the TV's menus, obviously, because of the video problem.It's a great TV, and has worked absolutely wonderfully since the day I got it back from the repair shop. I still recommend the TV, despite the problem I had with it, but I would suggest not purchasing high ticket items like this online. You might pay a little more getting a TV from a big box store, but you at least know that if it doesn't work out of the box, you can return it and get a new one in exchange on the same day and not suffer the hassles I had to.Otherwise, I very much recommend this TV if you have need for one in a small room.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	0	This world -- and especially Internet denizens -- could stand to learn more than a thing or two about punctuation (and grammar, also, although the two are inextricably entwined). Nevermind colons; nevermind semi-colons (although it is important to understand their proper use, as well). The section on commas alone makes this volume absolutely indispensible! Commas are so horribly misused and abused in our "Information Age" that incoherence and incomprehensibility are far too often the result.One thing I've encountered recently, for example, is the ignorance of some of how vocatives ought to be treated. A vocative, to quote Mr. Shaw, is "a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase used in direct address. That is, a vocative indicates to whom something is said." I have encountered sentences similar to the following:* "What would you do Mr. Kress if I were to put a pistol to your temple?"While understandable, the punctuation is completely lacking, and fails to note the pause that would occur in such a statement when Mr. Kress is addressed. Vocatives are to be set off by commas. Thus, the correct punctuation would be:* "What would you do, Mr. Kress, if I were to put a pistol to your temple?"Commas can also change the entire meaning of a sentence. The following, taken from the Bible, is an excellent example:* "I tell you the truth, today you will be with Me in Paradise."* "I tell you the truth today, you will be with Me in Paradise."In the first example, which is found in any Protestant or Catholic Bible, Christ is telling the thief on the cross next to him that that very day he shall join Christ in Paradise. In the second, while Christ promises the thief that he will be in Paradise, he makes no mention of when that will happen, leaving the thief to anguish in ignorance of when this promise will be fulfilled. The word "today" instead refers to Christ telling him the truth that day, which carries the implication that he might lie to him on the next day. This example shows just how important commas are and how important it is to know how to use them, whether you believe in the Bible or not.The book is organized in two divisions: 1) What Punctuation Is and Does, and 2) The Individual Marks.The first division begins with a chapter discussing that "punctuation is for clarity." There then follows a survey of punctuation, trends in punctuation, and the purposes of punctuation.The second division covers all the marks: abbreviations, accent (or diacritical) marks, apostrophes, asterisks, bars (virgules), braces, brackets, capital letters, the caret (^), colons, commas, compound words, dashes, ditto marks, division of words, ellipses, exclamation points, hyphens, italics, numerals, parentheses, periods, question marks, quotation marks, and, yes, even the dreaded and often misunderstood semi-colons.I absolutely love that an entire volume is devoted exclusively to punctuation. It's a volume which has served me well whenever I've had questions of my own as to how to punctuate a sentence I've written.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	1	An incredible book from an incredible writer. In one sentence de Camp provides an excellent means to know if you need to learn more about English or not. To wit:"If you see nothing wrong with such sentences as 'He stared like he had seen a ghost,' or 'An individual can return to any period of his entire life providing his passage is not blocked by engrams,' you do not know enough about writing English to tackle fiction."My copy is the 1975 edition, and it is well-worn from frequent reading.The book starts with an (at that time) fairly exhaustive history of imaginative fiction, moves on to discuss the modern genres, and then editors and publishers, and writers and readers.Their advice on preparing for a science fiction career, on getting ideas, on plotting, on writing, and on selling is, on the whole, still valid. If you ignore the bits about copyright (since this book pre-dates the 1976 Act and the 1998 Sonny Bono Act) and that the business section pre-dates the personal computer, you can still garner lots of useful advice from the entire book.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	1	This is easily one of the best books available on writing short fiction -- and I've read a LOT! Definitely top five. I purchased this book years ago and have read it several times. I've been reading it again and I've been amazed at the new gems I keep finding hidden inside. I'm currently hard at work on several short stories. Just last night I read a passage in which Knight speaks to a particular problem I've been trying to address:"Madame de Stal once wrote, 'If I had more time, I should have written you a shorter letter.' She meant, of course, that she was working out what she wanted to say as she went along, instead of thinking it through and then saying it briefly. If you are writing short stories this way, they are probably running to seven and eight and ten thousand words, and editors are probably sending them back. Compression is a matter of planning and method -- like packing things carefully in a suitcase instead of throwing them in helter-skelter."Above is the opening paragraph to two-and-a-half pages of material on "Compression." It ends with an exercise well-designed to address the problem.Knight's instructions are always specific, never nebulous, and they are relevant, workable, and reliable. As an example: two weeks ago I used one of several methods that Knight outlines in the book to generate an idea for a story. After generating the idea, I did some brief research and then outlined the story as I saw it (Knight addresses these latter two, but I followed my own methods for research and used Algis Budrys's ideas for outlining). When I sat down to write the story, it took me 6 days, and I ended up with a tale nearly 8,500 words long, which is longer than I wanted it to be. I set the story aside, so that I could cool off before editing it, and immediately started work on a new story. Meanwhile, I've been reading Knight's book. And then last night I come across his discussion on "Compression" and I have found in it material that I *know* will help me to shorten the story I've written and make it more appealing to editors.If you do the exercises and apply what you learn, your writing cannot help but improve.Finally, of all the books I've read on writing, Knight's has, I think, one of the best and most thorough discussions on point-of-view I've ever read. I've never had a problem with POV, but the chart in Knight's book is so incredibly helpful and handy I've copied it and have it on my desk where I can always see it. The section on POV alone makes the book worth many times its price. That it's packed to overflowing with similar items makes it invaluable.
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	0	0	The book is decent enough, but it is a first and, sadly, only novel. Whether it was due to Reamy's untimely death or not, I don't know, but there are obvious holes in the story... such as a sheriff who, when a murder is committed, decides inexplicably that the investigation can wait until the next day... and then you hear no more about it,... such as Haverstock, the villian, giving a rather lengthy explanation at the end of the story, an explanation prompted by Evelyn in an attempt to stall for time (all of which is rather disappointingly clich&eacute; and Hollywood-like), and... such as a 12-inch tall man (the story revolves around a carnival of freaks visiting a Kansas town) who is trying to find help for Evelyn and Angel, an albino with fantastic powers. The short guy ends up in a cat-load of trouble, finds a way out of it, and then... and then... and then... we're cut to the climactic scene, we're cut to a post-climactic scene, and the story ends and you're left wondering... what the hell happened to the 12-inch tall guy? Is he still in the can?
A1EKM4TTTSNUIL	1	1	A friend loaned me his copy of this book (which is autographed by Denton) and I'm glad that he did. The book is everything that all the 5-stars review say it is, but I have one quibble: The chapter where Blackburn kills the auto mechanics struck me as inconsistent with the rest of the book. The mechanics were too... hmm. How to put this? Perhaps the best way to put it is that the chapter read to me like a badly done comedy routine. Considering the structure of the book, it's a given that the victims will be less than fully developed, but the auto mechanics were flatter than pancakes rolled over by a steamroller. Some of the other victims came to life as they died (which might seem oxymoronic, but you'd have to read the book to get my drift), but the auto mechanics were more like sex dolls: They not only laid there and did nothing, but they also leaked air. If I could give the book 4.5 stars, I would. It deserves the extra half-star. The treadless auto mechanics aren't worth a full-star deduction, but because of them I can't bring myself to give the book five-stars.As to the main character, I liked Jimmy Blackburn and his quirky way of thinking, even though it resulted in the death of so many. It's amazing that you can actually come to like a killer as you will with this book. Regarding other characters, Roy-Boy was annoying as hell, but that's a good thing. It means that he had life in him for me not to like him. And Morton was freakin' hilarious! I want to see Morton resurrected from the dead. That said, let it be known that Morton giveth, and Morton taketh away. Great read!
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	1	1	I've already played all Gogol Bordello's later CDs by now - over and over. Decided to see what Eugene was doing a few years ago. Wow! I'm glad I did. A few of these songs are on later CDs but track 6 is found nowhere else that I'm aware of. I'm nuts about Madagascar. It sounds like nothing else he has done and that wonderful gypsy song at the end won't leave my head. Eugene's lyrics alone are worth the price of any of his CDs, then the music just blows the lid off.
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	1	1	I own most of the Avett Brothers' CDs but I especially love this one. This was made back when they were doing rip-snortin', screaming and stomping live performances. They've moderated that in more recent years and they're still better than anybody else out there, but I really preferred them back then. Some of the best love songs I've ever heard are on this CD - Smoke in Our Lights, November Blue and Offering just give me goose bumps. They really know how to tell a woman she's loved.
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	1	1	Most performers are enjoyed more after seeing them perform live. With the Avetts that goes double. Their performances are unique and terribly exciting. This video gives a good approximation of how they perform. Watch a few You Tube videos and if you like those, you'll really love this video. I've watched this so many times...
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	0	0	After reading 100 pages I realized I was completely uninterested in the characters or the story, if there was one. Since I had expected to enjoy the book I decided to keep reading and hoped I'd be glad I did. So at 279 pages (over half way through) when nothing else had happened at all I decided to call it quits. Yeah, I understand lots of scene setting and intro to all the characters, etc. But for 279 (or more maybe)pages? The first half of this book seriously needed an editor to cut, cut cut. With about half of the verbiage cut out maybe I could have reached the part where the plot started. Because half-way through there was no evidence at all of any storyline.
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	0	1	It's a fine product at a good price if you don't mind that one of the inactive ingredients is propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is the drug Miralax, which is a laxative. It's also used in anti-freeze and many other industrial uses. I have been taking this product for years and recently found out what this ingredient is. Since I have had problems with diarrhea for a long time I immediately stopped taking it. I don't think this supplement caused the diarrhea but it would be nuts to keep taking a product that might be making it worse. And besides, why ingest anything with such a nasty ingredient in it?
A1EKYWZUQFFWI7	1	1	I love post-apocalyptic novels but didn't think I'd want to read one about zombies. Just sounded silly. I started reading it and found it fascinating. The interview style and excellent writing made it seem plausible that this would happen, given that the characters also didn't think it was possible for the "undead" to be walking around. Governments, politicians, ordinary people all knew it was impossible until....

A1EM4OZ9PYRYPN	0	1	I've had this jewelry cleaner for about five months. So far, one of the battery covers has broken (I've taped it back together) and one side of the power switch has broken off. It cleans jewelry well, but it does hold up well to a lot of use. I clean my wedding rings about once a week, just to give you an idea of how much use it has received.
A1EM4OZ9PYRYPN	0	0	I would have liked this book a lot better if the the author had done her research and found out about Italian traditions. When Gianna and Rico visited a doctor in Italy, the doctor called them Mr. and Mrs. An Italian doctor would not have have called them Mr. and Mrs. He would have called them Signore and Signora. Also, in Italy, women do not take their husband's surname. If an American doctor had called them that, I would have been okay with it. But they had returned to Italy, and it just wasn't believable.The other thing that bothered me was all the sudden, when Gianna takes one of Rico's car, the author adds the information that Rico had told her and his mother they could not leave the villa without a bodyguard. That was never explained. Why did they need a bodyguard? Yes, he was rich, but that doesn't explain it. There had never been any threat to anyone's life, so it didn't add anything to the story.I guess these are things some readers can overlook, but it completely ruined the book for me.
A1EM4OZ9PYRYPN	1	1	I've always loved this movie since I saw it on tv when I was a young girl. Now I can watch it any time I like, and it's just as wonderful as I remember.
A1EM9K0YNCGYSS	1	1	I've just used my thermometer a few times, but it's working fine so far. I just got done re-programming the "done" temperatures from the USDA safe-but-inedibly-overcooked recommendations to more reasonable levels. That wasn't difficult at all--in fact, all the directions are very easy to follow.
A1EM9K0YNCGYSS	0	0	The biggest challenge of the potlucks I go to is that there's usually no way to re-heat your food. Hauling a piping-hot dish from home often isn't an option, either. And I can only make so many quiches, you know? So I keep buying potluck cookbooks, hoping to find recipes for things--particularly main dishes or other savories--that are good served at room temperature. I'm still looking, because this ain't it, either. This one is worse than most, in fact--a collection of not-very-interesting recipes, and nothing I can really take as a main dish to my office, or to a party right after work.
A1EM9K0YNCGYSS	1	1	It works great (who cares if the order is medium-dim-highest?) I had no trouble putting a CFL bulb in it without any modification. It's well-made and sturdy, and it looks great! Now I'm just hoping the pole lamp on the other end of the sofa dies, so we can buy the floor-standing version!
A1EM9K0YNCGYSS	1	1	I'm still not seeing the flaws some people have complained about here. The outer box is basic, but not really cheap or flimsy. The individual disc cases and labels are perfectly adequate. I suppose they could be even more fancy and elaborate...but do I really care? No.I have no complaints about the quality of the discs or the playback. With the first five discs the movie does start right up when you insert the disc, rather than going first to a menu screen. Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 have proper menus that come up first, and separate special features discs with more and better extras. But there *are* bonus features on the first five discs--trailers, deleted scenes, short interviews with cast and crew, the usual stuff. You can access them by pressing the "disc menu" button on your remote, or you can sit through all the multi-lingual anti-piracy warnings after the end credits--the menu will pop up. I imagine there would be more goodies on the deluxe edition discs, but I didn't pay the cost of the deluxe edition, did I? If you're looking at this set I'm betting a lot of you don't want to, either.I think this *is* the region-free version that other reviewers are recommending that you order from Amazon.co.uk. The URL printed on the disc cases is warnerbros.co.uk. The age rating symbols on the box are the ones awarded by the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office. After each movie ends, you see dozens of anti-piracy warnings, in every language under the sun--I've never seen that on a US version DVD. Also, everywhere in the first film--on the packaging, on the disc, in the titles, in the dialog--they refer to the "philosopher's stone" rather than the "sorcerer's stone." (The original UK book title was "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" but the US publisher thought that would put off American readers, so they dumbed it down to "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." They did the same with the movie so as not confuse fans of the book. But they only changed it in the US--everywhere else it was always "Philosopher's Stone." Personally, I find having the movie with the original title a plus!) The one thing I cannot find anywhere on the discs or packaging is the region code--but clearly, these are not the standard US editions.
A1EMKDPXJEJDUD	1	1	well jessicka fodera's new band scarling is a really good attempt, but she will never recapture the magic of jack off jill. first off the cd itself has only 7 tracks, and the track listing on the back is wrong. &quot; the last day i was happy&quot; is a good song, but it lacks that certain special jessicka touch, not her best work. 2/5. &quot;bandaid covers the bullethole&quot; good single i suppose, its a little too popish, reminds me of jack off jill's &quot;strawberry gashes&quot;. catchy words, i always find my self repeating randomly. 4/5. &quot;crispin glover&quot; by far the best song on sweet heart dealer, well written, composed beautifully, but my only complaint is the lenght, it seems it ends to quickly. either way 5/5. &quot;alexander the burn victim&quot; as far as i can tell this song is about alexander, jessicka's cat. which in my opinion is well out there, but coming from jessicka, not a shocker. the song is really catchy, and she sings immaculatly on it. i couldnt see her sing morebeautifully. 4/5. &quot;baby dracula&quot; no idea what this song is about, except maybe dracula? good song, more upbeat than the rest of the album, but nothing special.3/5. &quot;black horse riding star&quot; this track brings back jessicka's trademark JOJ scream, i love this song, you need to play it loud to annoy anyone you can, this song is full of raw anger and emotion, second best on the album. 5/5. &quot;cant (halloween valentine)&quot; honestly this song sucks. i always skip, i might have to listen it a few more times to dig it, but is repetitive, boring and overall no fun to listen to. the words are well written but that doesnt save it. 2/5. overall its good, jack off jill fans should pick it up.
A1EMKDPXJEJDUD	1	1	...damaged, is by far rommel regulation's best RiB work. each song is composed brilliantly using darkwave and industrial elements. each song tells a story of love and lies, at least thats how i took it. &quot;visions&quot; will make the price of this cd worth. best tracks are by far &quot;visions&quot;, &quot;ill damage you&quot; and &quot;blush&quot;. &quot;come back to me&quot; is the song most people would skip ( i know i do at time ). it lacks the RiB power that keeps me coming back for more. this abum is definitly a must-have for RiB fans or fans of darkwave all together.

A1EMKS5J6JIAVN	1	1	If you've loved the "Reality Dysfunction" and the following 4 books, and yes I loved them, then this is a great book to read. It takes you on a journey, with short stories, from the beginning of spacefaring Earthlings until the first strange happinings in the Reality Dusfunction. You even meet the famous father of captain Calvert.I hope Hamilton will wright more of these short-bits concerning bitek and affinity. Great
A1EMKS5J6JIAVN	0	0	It was a nice subject, but the way it was written was a bit boring. There was much more to make of this theme.Call it a snack, nothing more. I don't no way people give it 5 stars. It's certainly not the best sci-fi there is.

A1EMN2RHC9J9XV	0	0	I should learn that SONY is a shell of its former self and the quality is not there. This radio looks good, but looks are decieving. The reception is poor, the poorest I have seen. And I am close to the business. Even local stations that my other HD radios picked up without a hitch, this radio had to struggle. Even fussing with the antenna, this radio could not pick up many non-HD stations. Yes, the AM was disappointing too. Of all the HD Radios I have, this was the only one I decided to return. I am not mean by giving this one star. If the radio does not pick up atations, who cares about any other feature?
A1EMP2UK99FINF	1	1	I read this book when it came out om August 2004. I LOVED it then, and just finished re-reading it this weekend.Storyline is original, characters are fully-fleshed and endearingly human.While some parts of the plot were a bit far-fetched, the tension between the main characters was tenderly described.
A1EMP2UK99FINF	1	1	I have read just about every version of every plot line out there. THIS BOOK got me hooked immediately........Dialogue: Jane Austen would be proud, but enough light dialogue that today's readers don't get lost in the script.Characters: Simply SCADS of fabulous charactersStory: FantasticIn short....heroine's brother (who wears rose colored glasses LOL) is going to race the Marquess of Swale....heir to the Duke of Auckland. Cary Wayburn, brother of Juliet (heroine) gets attacked by "footpads" the night before. His friend saves him from being killed, and overheards the villans telling Cary Wayburn the beating was a gift from Lord SWALE.Cary is brought home to recover, and Juliet learns her brother was singled out due to Lord Swale.She decides to get even by humiliating Lord Swale in the race. If he's beaten by a woman.......well...that will surely teach him!!OK, I won't give any more of the plot away except to say....... for a debut novel, it is simply sinful to miss it.Best scene: Newts vs. RatsThank you, Tamara Lejeune for an original....very funny..sweetly romantic book.Tip for author: Love scenes need some work...come at the reader with no preparation, and aren't terribly romantic.I'm keeping this book, and plan to re-read it.
A1EMP2UK99FINF	1	1	I bought this book yesterday, and finished it this morning (I fell asleep around 3AM, still clutching the book).This has to be one of her best. It had all the best elements: Dying EARL Dad trying to make amends for criminal meglect of his NINE illigetimate children. (NOTE: You're going to write NINE novels on this series? Sheez.) OK, back to my point: All the best elements: Lost children being found, twins cruelly apart and finding each other again, Heroine lost to society through no fault of her own, Hero lost to society due to his father, and impressment.Hero and heroine find each other on a rocky coastline........thanks to a marauding sheep (ewe, to be exact).It isn't LOVE at first sight, both dislike each other intensely.Thanks to the same sheep (ewe).Along comes Reeves, the butler, employee of the now deceased Earl/Dad. His job is to make a gentleman/Earl of the Hero. Not an easy task, as it turns out.Highlights of the book: I laughed about the antics of the "crew", especially Stevens. He eventually learns to knock first. The sheep/ewe that broke into the garden. Reeves little book excerpts, particuliarly his cleaning recipe.All in all, the book was a romp. I loved it.Thanks, Karen. I was beginning to get somewhat jaded over the current quality of books being published.Oh, and Karen? I don't "know you" because of your books. I just enjoy them like an sane person would.PS: Hugo is the BOMB.
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	STARRING:Daisy Berkowitz Psychoacoustical Guitars.Twiggy Ramirez (Gidget Gein actually plays all base guitar on the album): Base Tendencies.Madonna Wayne Gacy: Hammond Organ, Theremin, Saxophone, Calliopenis, Brass, Babies, Distorted Muzette, Loops.Sara Lee Lucas: Hitting.and Mr. Manson: Accusations, Child Manipulations, Backwards Masking, Polaroids.At this stage in their evolution, Marilyn Manson was clearly a band, not just the project of Brian Warner a.k.a. Mr. Manson, who would later simply adopt his band's name as his own. Also, horror-show schlock was a bigger factor than it would be later on, when he wanted to be the Antichrist Superstar for the world at large. In other words, it's Manson at his silliest, singing about "My Monkey" and "Snake Eyes and Sissies."Beneath all the camp shock, there are signs of Warner's unerring eye for genuine outrage and musical talent, particularly on the trio of "Cake and Sodomy," "Lunch Box" and "Dope Hat." But even a few years on from its 1994 release, Portrait of an American Family has begun to sound a little dated, especially since its Nine Inch Nails-meets-WASP-meets-Alice Cooper formula was fully realized on Manson's follow-up album, Antichrist Superstar. Here, it's in sketch form, and by the end of the album it's clear that Warner, Manson, whatever you want to call him, needs a full canvas to truly wreak havoc.See U in the Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	Inspired by the image and musical cues of Bowie, Warner reworked Marilyn Manson into a sleek, androgynous space alien named Omega, a la Ziggy Stardust, and constructed a glammy variation of his trademark goth-metal. With pal Billy Corgan as an unofficial consultant and Soundgarden producer Michael Beinhorn manning the boards, Manson turns Mechanical Animals into a big, clean rock record -- the kind that stands in direct opposition to the dark, twisted industrial nightmares he painted with his first two albums. Not my favorite album, but it comes in third place when you speak of his greatest albums.1. Great Big White World (7/10)- A good opener. Nuff said.2. The Dope Show (10/10)- This is actually the song that got me into Manson. All the lyrics about drugs and whatnot.3. Mechanical Animals (6/10)- An okay song I guess. Just too slow, though.4. Rock is Dead (15/10)- This is one of the heaviest songs on the album, to tell you the truth. And one of the best.5. Disassociative (20/10)- My favorite track from the entire album. Sometimes slow songs can be pretty cool, just as long as the guitars still rock your balls off and the lyrics are easy to understand.6. The Speed of Pain (8/10)- I just never found out what people saw in this song. Still good enough, though.7. Posthuman (7.5/10)- Eh...Just good, not great.8. I Want to Disappear (6.5/10)- See above.9. I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me) (12/10)- Very catchy, and the video is funny as hell.10. New Model No.15 (10/10)- Very electric with some very heavy riffs. Very good song, in other words.11. User Friendly (9.5/10)- An addicive song.12. Fundamentaly Loathsome (5.5/10)- To me, this is the worst song on the album. Too slow and hard to get into.13. The Last Day on Earth (10/10)- One of his songs with really meaningful lyrics.14. Coma White (1,000,000/10)- I remember me and my ex-girlfriend used to listen to this song all the time. The song is really great and the video fits perfect with the song.All in all, a very good album with very few flaws. I recomend this to people who have atleast heard one or two of Manson's earlier songs and are planing on buying one of his albums. Actually, this one or the greatest hits. You decide, I suck at deciding.See U in the Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	A follow up of the 1998 neo-glam album known as "Mechanical Animals", Marilyn picks his mic stand back up delivering a darker style apparent in his "Antichrist Superstar" yesteryears. This time the album's focal points deal with evolution and revolution. Rife with references to the Beatles and the Kennedys, and full of pop-culture barbs, Holy Wood is a musically diverse and powerful statement.Holy Wood is the final element of Marilyn Manson's three album triptych to be released. This album both tells the beginning of and foreshadows the end of the epic story.1. Godeatgod (7/10)A very good song to open this excellent album.2. The Love Song (10/10)I remember the other day I was singing this to myself all day. Once you listen to it, its stuck in your head. A lot like porn.3. The Fight Song (50/10)A TRUE Manson classic. Just listen, if you haven't already.4. Disposable Teens (40/10)See comment for song above.5. Target Audience (1,000,000/10)My favorite Manson song out of his entire catalogue! Through my eyes, this puts 'Get Your Gunn' to shame.6. President Dead (5/10)Nothing special, really. But that doesn't mean its a crappy song.7. In the Shadow of the Valley of Death (3/10)The one song I always skip, because its TOO slow and melodic. I think this is where the album starts to drop.8. Cruci-Fiction in Space (4/10)Now the album starts to pick up after track 7.9. A Place in the Dirt (6/10)What did I tell you?10. The Nobodies (7/10)Eh...Not that crazy about it, but its still a classic.11. The Death Song (5/10)Not too sure about it.12. Lamb of God (8/10)Pretty catchy.13. Born Again (6/10)See the comment above.14. Burning Flag (9/10)Heavy song, no doubt.15. Coma Black (8/10)No Comment.16. Valentines Day (9.5/10)Not to slow, but not too fast either. Yep, its cool with me.17. The Fall of Adam (??/10)I dunno.18. King Kill 33 (12/10)Another heavy track, another good rating.19. Count to Six and Die (??/10)Again, I don't know.I own all of Manson's CD's, and I have to say this is the one I listen to the most, besides Mechanical Animals. Anyway, for the heavy tracks and the songs with good ratings, I give this CD a 9/10. Yeah, thats it.See U in the Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	After several years of being written off as Trent Reznor's studio creation, Marilyn Manson returned in 1998 with Mechanical Animals, a blistering riff on human disaffection at the end of the century. And though it wasn't received as strongly as 1996's Antichrist Superstar, Animals was a more emotional musical statement, and proof positive that Manson was captain of his own ship, apart from Reznor's patronage. The tour that followed was plagued by troubles from the start -- financial issues, a much-publicized feud between the star and tour openers Hole, and Manson's own leg injury. The Last Tour On Earth is a document of that tour, and as far as live albums go, it's about what you'd expect.Production was a big part of Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals -- and though the live versions of "Big White World," "The Dope Show" and " The Beautiful People" that appear here sound peachy, there's also nothing about them to make you forget the originals.See U in the Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	The video contains a 1996 documentary of the controversial Antichrist Superstar tour. The video features 10 songs from the Antichrist Superstar album and the albums before it. Manson delivers a chaotic performance through every one of the songs.Aside from the live performances there are also segments of behind the scenes footage of the band as well as the protesters who tried so very hard to stop the show from happening. Manson briefly states his philosophy in his commentaries.See U In The Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	God is in the T.V. is a collection of all Marilyn Manson's music videos from "Get Your Gunn" (1994) up to "Coma White" of Mechanical Animal's fame. The music videos play in reverse chronological order.This video isn't just a mere compilation of music videos. In addition, God is in the T.V. contains 1 hour footage of live performance and backstage appearances on the "Rock is Dead" tour. A must have for any fan.See U In The Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	1	1	This is a mind-bending look at one of the world's most controversial artists both on and off the stage. Shot throughout the U.S., Japan, Russia and Europe, this release spotlights the performance that has made Manson truly infamous.This DVD contains features whichs give the viewer an "all access pass" to off stage life and a glimpse behind the scenes as the tour takes them from Tokyo to Berlin, Moscow to Rome, Long to New York, and everywhere in between.See U In the Future...
A1EN20O9LYW6QC	0	0	I have to agree with everyone on this (aside from the 975 retards who gave this a 5 star rating), St. Anger flat out sucked. However, I do have to agree with the 975 retards who gave this a 5 star rating on one thing; I understand that Metallica doesn't want to be stuck in their past, and only be remembered for instant classics like Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, and Black Album. Yeah, I see they wanted to try something new, but even then, I don't see how these people have the audacity to say that St. Anger belongs up there in Metallica's list of great albums. The lyrics suck, the guitars suck, the drums are terrible (Sounds like tree twigs beating on a few rusty trash can lids.), and what the f**k happened to James' vocals? Does he have something stuck in his throat, or something?What these guys did to their sound was obviously a bad decision, and judging from the number of bad reviews, I don't think they're going to try and release a new album. Internet resources say Metallica is thinking about releasing a new album. They obviously aren't going to go back to their metal roots and release another Master of Puppets. (They do alternative-metal now, which I don't see why people bitch and gripe about. If you like bands like Tool or this new Nine Inch Nails, alternative music isn't all that bad).I guess what gets people is the fact that the former kings of metal (I wasn't around in the eighties, but I'm guessing thats how they refered to themselves.) have turned alternative. It've been better if they did the opposite (Alternative to Metal). Well theres obviously nothing none of us can do about them, but badmouth them from our home computer. But then, who knows? One of us might go to one of their concerts in the future and tell them exactly how we feel. But until then, our keyboard is our only stress reliever for this poor excuse for a comeback album, called St. Anger.See U In the Future...
A1ENS1DA8FSRZE	1	1	This DVD is great. The techniques outlined are really useful for calming fussy babies. New parents don't have a lot of time or brain power to read books, so it is really nice having the info on a short DVD. This was recommended to me by many friends before we had our twins, and I will recommend it to all my friends who are expecting.
A1ENS1DA8FSRZE	1	1	This is a very enjoyable book. It is put together as more of a series of vignettes, rather than as a continuous narrative. They are wonderful stories, and most are accompanied by recipes. Reading this book makes me want to travel and cook, mostly cook. I tried her recipe for Rice con Queso and it was delicious! I can't wait to try more recipes and read more of her books.
A1EO02W3N6M4DU	0	0	I have seen every one of the legitimate Hamlets available on tape or DVD (excepting the Burton). I have seen Hamlet cuttings that were questionable but interesting, including Pryce creating a Hamlet who &quot;channels&quot; the Ghost. This is the only Hamlet I have ever turned off before Horatio laments the cracking of his friend's heart. I stopped it because this Hamlet is heartless, an empty thing that swings between pretense and silliness, as if a college fraternity had mounted the play as a drunken prank.There are some who find setting the play in New York compelling and Hawke's attempt at Hamlet winsome. Both could have been interesting (but face facts: Manhattan-as-Denmark and a fresh, untutored Hamlet are hardly new ideas). What destroys this Hamlet is the abuse of Shakespeare's language. Naked actors who understand the rhythm and punctuation of Hamlet can land this play on bare concrete.I would be more forgiving if this were presented as a learning experience by a student director. To put the actors through this nonsense and present it to the public as a serious work degrades the actors and wastes the audience's time.
A1EO02W3N6M4DU	0	0	I cannot recommend this novel. Read one of the many summaries that I am sure will be posted to the Web and wait for the next installment.Mr. Jordan needs to either admit that he's over his head and quit the Wheel of Time series or write a sequel loaded with the magical action that characterized the first novels in this series. Tor needs to realize that it is profoundly disappointing customers to the degree that, should Mr. Jordan produce another truly interesting work, all of us who were won during the early days of &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; might no longer care.The Times was correct to say that Jordan dominated &quot;the world that Tolkien began to reveal&quot; in the first, truly wonderful novels in this series. Jordan, apparently with Tor's approval, has created a crossroads for himself with Crossroads of Twilight. Travelers who do not know their way will pause at a crossroads and consider their options. Jordan's (and Tor's) options are to give up and go into the twilight, never resolving the story, or to produce a novel worthy of the mantle presented by the Times: publish something as good as _The_Return_of_the_King_.Your readers wait and hope you will succeed.
A1EO1M6UZDAJGB	1	0	I'm a potter and have used this putty to secure my pots on shelves. It works very well. It isn't so strong you risk breakage if you forget and try to pick it up, but it is strong enough to ensure it doesn't get bumped over by accident.Another great use is behind picture frames to help hold them level. Hang the prints by a wire as usual, but put the putty on the two bottom corners of the print and stick it to the wall once it is level. I might order two if you plan on securing a bunch of stuff. One package is only good for a few things, maybe a dozen assorted pots.I have no complaints about it so far.
A1EO1M6UZDAJGB	1	1	This is about the best out-of-a-bag dog food there is. Zoos don't feed their wolves dog-food from a bag, they feed them a natural diet. That is best, but if you can't do that this is 2nd best, IMHO.
A1EO1M6UZDAJGB	1	1	This book has a bunch of bat house information and is very well focused. The plans are exact and great. I've built three of them using the plans verbatim and all have come out well.
A1EO2M514SYKV8	1	1	I was a fan of Chevelle with their Point #1 album and was excited for their Wonder What's Next cd only to be highly disappointed thinking well now that chevelle's sold themselves out whats next. Thus this album was greeted with a level of doubt. But on the first listen, I realized that CHevelle must have been having the sophomore album blues because TTOT is an intense harkening back to their Point 1 album. The boys managed to lay down a harder hitting yet melodic album in an era where that combination more often than not leads to corny music (ie. Breaking Benjamin, Papa Roach, Atreyu, Underoath...etc.) The music itself is not outwardly complex with insane riffs and crazy trash beats. Instead well put chord movements and tastefully used double bass hooks dominate instead. This album is an outstanding album in all repects and a must buy.
A1EO2M514SYKV8	1	1	I've been a Hopesfall fan for a while, since No Wings came out, and the thing that facinated me the most with the band is its musical creativity. I find that they are similar to Opeth (not musically) that they are classified into a genre but really only have one element in common with the rest of the genre. If we pick apart TSY, the music has more in common with newer glassjaw and newer deftones that it does with hardcore. Which leads us to A-Types...I was like every other Hopesfall fan in the sense that I was initially disappointed by the album A-Types. But I also found I couldn't stop listening to it. I also found that musically it was more of a simplified, more organized, and better produced version of TSY. One of the biggest complaints with A-Types are the vocals. I find this arguement a little unfounded considering the fact that 4 of the 6 songs contain a minimal amount of screaming and that almost every song on the album has some sort of singing during it. In any case, Jay can sing very well and lyrically this isn't your everyday "cut my throat" whining. Jay's lyrics are just facinating to read because you are forced to draw your own meaning out of the songs. Back to the music itself. The album swings around almost as moodily as the older Hopesfall albums. They switch through time signatures with incredible easy. Every part of the song belongs right where it is and nothing is done in excess. The songs The Ones and Per Sempre Marchiamo captured me with their sheer emotion. This a great album once you get past the band's former versions. I can't wait to hear their next album and see what direction they go from here.Stand Out Tracks: Icarus, Breathe From Coma, The Ones, Per Sempre Marchiamo
A1EOQFX7DE3SBI	1	1	This is probably the best style book out there... even though it is a bit old. It has a lot of good tips for every body size or type.... It isn't about brands, it is about style and how to have it... It is perfect...
A1EOQFX7DE3SBI	0	1	Not worth it... no sit ups or intensity with this video... The only part I actually felt a little burn in my abs was the last yoga segment, which was about 10 minutes. If you are looking for a good ab workout, check out the Exhale Core Fusion workouts... a real good ab workout for 10 minutes....
A1EOQFX7DE3SBI	1	1	This is a really good p.m. yoga workout with a lot of stretching. The scenery was a very nice beach setting. The workouts were very relaxing and helps with sleep.... The video was a little shorter than her usual videos though.
A1EOQFX7DE3SBI	1	1	I love this DVD, but maybe I am a little biased these days, because I am loving everything by Shiva Rea. The yoga is challenging, which is how I like it. It gives me something to work at. Much better for intermediate or advanced students, but beginners can learn a lot by doing the routines over and over again.... It doesn't get boring... You just need to get the flow...
A1EOQFX7DE3SBI	0	0	I really wanted to try meditation, but staring at a TV while watching this video was very bad for my eyes, and made my eyes very dry. I can't meditate staring at a bonsai tree or a waterfall on a TV.... I just can't do it...
A1EOXZ29IHSTW6	1	1	So far, I've read the first three volumes of this series and of the three, this is probably my least favorite of the bunch but not by much. The artwork in general isn't quite as impressive as in Volumes 1 and 3, and the first story ("Mother Russia") is pretty much just an all-out shoot-'em-up gorefest. I find Ennis's take on everyday lowlifes (mafiosi, street-level thugs) more engaging than his tales of international espionage. That's not to say it's not a good story, but relative to what I've seen thus far, it impressed me the least.The second story ("Up is Down, Black is White") was probably the most lurid and vile thing I've seen from Ennis thus far. In fact it almost reads like he's trying to push the envelope further with each turn of the page. It opens with a vicious grave desecration, and moves right on to familicide and incest. It's the better of the two offerings, but possibly a bit much for most readers.
A1EOXZ29IHSTW6	1	1	Garth Ennis's work with the Punisher easily merits comparison with Frank Miller's "Sin City" series. It's bloody, remorseless noir fiction at its finest, and moreso than Miller, Ennis manages to work in a bit of levity here and there to make the mayhem that much easier to stomach. The stories aren't just about the Punisher, which is part of what makes them so appealing. Ennis fills his dark world with fascinating, often bizarre characters, and the Punisher in a way serves as both a narrator and a malicious force of nature driving these irredeemable souls to their inevitable, blood-drenched doom. If you're an Ennis fan, a Punisher fan, or even a Frank Miller fan, then I'd highly recommend this series for you, and this first volume especially.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	I love Dave Duncan's writing, and I love his Kings' Blade series. If this really is the last one I'll be very, very sad. If Dave feels he needs to move on from this world then so be it, but I'll be very, very sad.The reason I like Duncan's work is because not only does he come up with great plots, great ideas, he gives us truly memorable characters and his writing style sings. Aspiring fantasy writers should read him and notice how he combines action and tension and pace with lyricism, with poetic narrative. It means you really get huge bang for your bucks.Duncan is one of the very best writers working in fantasy today. If you haven't read him, shame! Start with The Gilded Chain.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	First, a caveat: I know Glenda, and like her very much. That being said, however, I'd also point out that I write this review without prompting, and wouldn't say a word of it if I didn't truly believe in the opinion expressed below.Glenda's fantasy trilogy is a great read, with passion and tragedy and suspense and some brilliant worldbuilding. When it comes to creating a fantasy environment you can truly see, smell, taste and touch, I don't think there's another writer in the genre anywhere who can beat her. She's a master of this skill.She also sets up difficult moral and ethical questions for her characters and doesn't let them off the hook. Also, throughout the trilogy (we've got it all in Australia, wheee!), Glenda takes bold chances in structure and execution, which means the books are refreshingly orginal and bold in style.I'm pleased beyond words that readers in America are getting the chance to enjoy her work.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	Just a repeat of my previous caveat -- Glenda is known to me personally, so it's up to other readers/reviewers to decide if I've remained successfully unbiased.Gilfeather shows a strong progression in Glenda's writing. It's an interesting twist in the fantasy genre, especially the middle book of a trilogy, taking a brand new character and making (in this case) him the focus of the action. Readers beware: the cover art is misleading with this book. The focus really is on a healer, Gilfeather, whose life and belief system are overturned as a result of his meetings with the characters introduced in the previous book, The Aware.Gilfeather is a great character, well drawn. The world building continues excellent -- I've said it before, I'll say it again -- nobody in the genre does it better than Glenda. The return of familiar characters from bk 1 is welcome. Tension escalates, the stakes are raised.Having had the privilege of reading some of Glenda's yet to be published manuscripts, I can say with hand on heart that nobody puts a spin on the fantasy genre the way she does. She has the most unique and refreshing world view, steps far away from the traditional tropes/settings, and is to be congratulated for doing so.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	While I absolutely believe that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' response to a book, because it's all just personal opinion, I'm taken aback by some of the hostility I'm seeing here.If you went to see a play, would you complain the story wasn't finished at the end of the first act? No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ... because until we do reach the end, we can't tell.I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it.Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story. This is a saga of unequalled breadth and passion, with characters who live, for me, more powerfully than any other in fiction at the moment.Bravo, Mr Martin. You're to be congratulated.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong is a huge movie, and this 'behind the scenes' companion is a wonderful complement to it. The book looks great, it's beautifully designed to tie in with the 30s era, it has great photos and is well laid out.Even better, the writing is wonderful. Flowing, informative, conversational and always engaging, it really tells you about the processes of bringing this story to life.Excellent book, well worth collecting.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	I'm a huge Dave Duncan fan, most particularly of his King's Blades series, and the associated books. I also really enjoyed Children of Chaos and am looking forward to Mother of Lies, the conclusion of that saga. I didn't know what to expect when I picked up Alchemist's Apprentice, and initially I was a bit taken aback because generally speaking I really don't enjoy first person narratives (with the exception of crime/mystery).But I really enjoyed this one. AA isn't a 'typical' fantasy novel. It's grounded strongly in historical fact, and in some ways is more an historical mystery with a touch of the supernatural than what you might consider a 'traditional' fantasy. There's a death that proves to be a murder, and the apprentice of the doctor and expert in the occult , Nostradamus, nephew of the famous Nostradamus, is put on the job of uncovering the murderer ... with the help of a fiend, and some psychic stuff, and a great deal of running around. In Venice. Complete with gondolas, sword-play, courtesans and politics.The historical detail is perfectly incorporated. The characters are uniformly excellent. It wouldn't be Duncan without some touches of humour, and the humour this time is delightfully dry and sly.It's definitely a different kind of story from this masterful writer, but I like different. And I'm so encouraged that after many years and many books, Duncan can still come up with something new, entertaining and beautifully executed.
A1EOZJW1OPR01	1	1	I have waited for the dvd release of this for ages. Love it to bits and have done ever since I saw it on tv, then got the tape. Picture quality on this dvd edition is fine, but I am disappointed by the low sound setting. I don't know what's happened there, but there are some songs (most particularly the Hail Poetry chorus) that I really wanted to crank up to high volume, and I can't. There's a very low pre setting on the sound for this production.That aside, I highly recommend this new release. I'm not a G&S; fan, as such, and certainly not a purist. But I think everyone in the cast is admirable, the singing is divine, and Kevin Kline pretty well mandates a cold shower after viewing.

A1EP94ER4QQYDI	1	0	Although I wouldn't categorize this book as &quot;life changing&quot;, I also don't agree with many reviewers that _Ishmael_ is a waste of time or poorly written.Granted, the protagonist of this story is quite dense and the premise of the &quot;Takers&quot; and the &quot;Leavers&quot; is pretty redundant at times... and okay-- the ideas expressed aren't exactly new or original. I'll give the negative reviewers that.But... this book makes you think. I originally read it for a Sociology project in college and have re-read it 3 or 4 times since. Its simplicity and repetition makes the concepts easy to understand. I don't agree with other reviewers that you have to be stupid to find value in the arguments in this book. They are clear, concise, and well-articulated.I'm not a theologian or a philosophy scholar but I am interested in making our world a safer place for ALL creatures. This book reaffirmed my beliefs that we--as humans--have overstepped our bounds in regards to our use and destruction of the earth.Read this book. Make up your own mind. You're not stupid for wanting your arguments to be spelled out concretely.

A1EPFFRIQ32WKF	1	0	Let's all be honest. The only reason everyone is buying this is because it says NIKON. And NIKON users like myself are suckers for this kind of stuff. I do like the fact that I can attach it to my Black Rapid R7 strap and pull out the cloth to quickly wipe a smudges on my expensive glass. And of course it says NIKON on it.
A1EPFFRIQ32WKF	0	1	I tried to save a few dollars and purchased this one instead of the one made by Pampered Chef. The lid is not a perfect fit. The meat dries out too fast.
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	1	My son loves the books, and loved this movie too. I thought this film was great, although eerily reminiscent of the eighties TV show 'Wonder Years'. Either way, a great family movie. If your child likes this film, you should check out the Wonder Years as well.
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	1	This is a brilliant account of one man's fight against the zombie apocalypse. The book is extremely well written, it flows beautifully and I really enjoyed the military aspect that J.L. Bourne brought to it. It is a gripping survivalist read. The only downside? Day by Day Armageddon was the first zombie book I ever read, World War Z was the second.. and few books in the zombie genre can compare to these two books. They are both absolutely brilliant. I only wish I could read them both for the first time again. I give this book my highest recommendation!!
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	0	I feel bad for you because if you're reading this, you probably have lice. If you don't then you should probably read this review and order this comb anyway to have it on hand in the event of lice. Our family got horrendous lice. By the time we discovered it, our son had 50+ adult bugs plus countless infant lice and eggs. My daughter, husband and I all had it as well in varying degrees but fairly badly too. We used RID and it half worked. Some lice died, others kept on trucking. Our son had long thick hair and we had to shave it all off, it was that bad.Our friend used to work for a lice removal company and she advised us against paying for their services because they prey on your panic and can cost several thousand dollars for a family of four. Why pay for them to do it when you can do it yourself? We used a spray bottle with half conditioner, half water, some tee tree oil and lavender to cover the smell because the kids hated the tee tree so much. You need to use the the conditioner because it slows the lice down and makes them easier to catch. It also loosens the eggs for removal. On the first day you need to section the hair into four quarters, then section very fine small lines and comb thru in several directions (eg. top to bottom, from underneath and from side to side). You should comb each section three times. After each comb thru, wipe the comb on paper towels to get the eggs and baby lice off (we went thru 12 rolls for our family in a week) and then rinse in a bowl of water. The first day it took roughly 2-3 hours to comb each persons hair. Subsequent days took about an hour per person. We were pulling eggs out for 7 days but our infestation was particularly nasty and we have very thick hair. You will also need to wash your clothes, sheets and towels every day in hot water and tumble dry them plus put your pillows and comforters in the tumble dryer on hot for 20 minutes. Also be sure to bag up any soft toys, bean bags, cushions etc and put them in the garage for two weeks. We basically lost a week of our lives between the combing and the laundry but we did get rid of the lice.This method is time consuming but if you are methodical you can get rid of the lice yourself. The lice companies use this same comb and they will use the same method to remove it. This comb is the ONLY way that you will get rid of your lice. If I could give it ten stars I would, it's really that good! Get the overnight shipping because if you are like me you will be losing your mind once you discover the lice. And don't think that you can use the plastic combs from the drug store or which come with the RID kits because they don't work.One more tip. Be sure to talk to your kids friends parents and have them check their families. We gave it to other families and by the time it was discovered the parents had caught it as well. If the friends have it, they will give it your kids and vice versa. You will only get rid of it if all your kids friends and their families are free of it as well.We also used Koo-dies Shampoo which is natural and has shown in numerous tests to be more effective at killing lice and eggs than the poison shampoos. Use every second day for a week after your outbreak. You can buy it on Amazon.This comb is AMAZING! I can't say enough good things about it.
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	1	I'm not a self help type person. I'm a high stress type A++ personality who tunes out when people start talking about meditation and spirituality. It's not that I don't believe in these things, but really, who has the time? My mother in law gave me this book for Christmas and it sat under my bed for two years. To cut a long story short I eventually read it and it changed my life. Years later, I am still calm (thanks to this book) and I re-read it when I feel myself starting to slip. I've never read any other spiritual books and I don't need to. If you're like me, then this book could save you. It's simple to read and the effects are immediate. I even got off Xanax for panic attacks when flying thanks to this book. If you're a stress mess, don't wait!
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	1	My son received this as a birthday gift and we loved it so much we bought them as gifts for other kids. It's fascinating to watch the ants burrow around however there is one inaccuracy in the literature. Despite what it says, when the ants die in the tunnels, the other ants do not bring the body to the top of the gel, hence you cannot remove it. The tunnels get clogged up with dead ants. I do not see how you could reuse it when all the ants die, it would look like an ant cemetery. Also, be really careful when you remove the lid to let the fresh air in, they rush very fast to escape. It's important to let the fresh air in because they seem to get depressed and slow down without it. Best to put them in the fridge for ten minutes beforehand to calm them before opening the lid. Otherwise a great product!
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	1	1	I love novels about dysfunctional families, two of my favorites are Augusten Burrough's Running with Scissors and David Sedaris's Naked. I thought I might find this book depressing but I didn't. In spite of the chaos and suffering, it's surprisingly upbeat, due in part to it largely being written from the perspective of a child. It's incredibly easy to read, the language flows effortlessly. I just loved it. An amazing and inspiring book.
A1EPGMU0U5AFWW	0	1	These boots are cool looking. My only complaint about these boots is they are super tight around the ankle. I am fairly slender with skinny ankles, if anything I usually have problems with boots being too big - however I have to wear a thick pair of wool socks with these boots so they don't rub on my ankles when I dance or walk. I'd hoped wearing the thick socks would stretch them eventually but no dice - they are cut too tight. I imagine they'd be very uncomfortable for girls with largish ankles or lower legs.
A1EPHTU7S8MBV8	1	1	Originally I picked this up for my husband. His car stereo was stolen and we lived a few hours apart. I picked it for its long battery life and the easy-access buttons. I later got one for myself when my old CD-style MP3 player failed on me in Iraq. I found it very comfortable to carry in my hand while running. The shape fits nicely and the buttons are in quick and easy reach. It's quite durable and has lasted a good two years and counting.I've also used it on our motorcycle trips. Even tucked in my pocket the buttons were easy to access and use if I wanted to skip or replay songs. It has even survived a motorcycle wreck. The clip that holds in the battery cover is the only thing that broke (It's now got packing tape on it :D )My only grumble about this is it's hard to find that one song you want to hear out of the hundred or so you've got stashed on it. :) but that'd require a larger screen and I like the size the MP3 player is now.
A1EPHTU7S8MBV8	1	1	I like them a lot, beautiful light-blue stones. They didn't look quite as delicate as I thought they were when I ordered them but looking at the image now I can see where I got my misconception. The white reflection on the white background you can kind of miss some of the details. But very beautiful. I am very happy.
A1EPHTU7S8MBV8	0	0	Low quality thread, low quality tools, low quality case. On three days of light use one of the arms broke off. After a few weeks one of the large sides broke off.The spools are always falling out no matter how well I stick them on. This didn't end up being worth the money. Maybe for a young starting newbie. I was getting back into sewing and had managed to misplace a lot of my tools in a move. Wanted to kick-start my new set and ended up buying all new tools on top of this.
A1EQYTE9O6X68M	1	1	Juliet Marillier is a brilliant author, and I highly recommend this book. Until I read Daughter of the Forest, I didn't think I could get so engrossed in a book, I just couldn't put it down! Though based on a myth, it's so well-written that you feel like _you_ are Sorcha going through all the pain and joys with her. Well worth reading and re-reading; it's at the top of my favorites list.Cailla
A1EQYTE9O6X68M	1	1	Nicely written story. Although it was originally meant to be a trilogy (up to book 5 currently) it has kept me interested and I'm looking forward to book 5. They are pleasantly paced and good reading.ShatteredCrystalChalice
A1EQYTE9O6X68M	1	1	Very good reading, alot more interesting than book 1. I loved the way the characters Iseult and Lachlan reacted towards each other. It's worth reading. Book 3 is brilliant too :)ShatteredCrystalChalice
A1EQYTE9O6X68M	1	1	Better than book 1, The Cursed Towers is just as great as book 2, perhaps more. I never grew bored reading, it was very enjoyable. Isabeau going to the Spine of the World was really intriguing. The characters are well written and the series is worth reading.ShatteredCrystalChalice
A1ER0GJ8KHIW17	0	1	I've been reading and enjoying fantasy for many years, and am neither young nor stupid. This book, put simply, was horrific. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I am entirely baffled at how anyone could think this is well written or inventive. Paolini is a thief. He should be ashamed of himself for such outright plagiarism. Even a young kid should know better.
A1ER0GJ8KHIW17	0	0	As much as I like and respect Clay Aiken, this is an absolute, utter mess.The lessons he should have learned on American Idol would have told him NEVER to have made this CD. Some of those lessons: Don't remake a song unless you have something to add to it; Don't remake a song unless there's something you can do to make it completely, utterly your own.So what happened? Clay has legions of fans WHO DESERVE BETTER. Clay himself deserves better. What corporate muckhead decided that this was a good idea?The arrangements (the music behind the lyrics) demonstrate a complete lack of effort on the part of the producers. It's as if they just decided Clay needed something out there, and so they threw this thing together. There are so many other songs that Clay could have remade that would have been better suited his voice. Can these muckheads who are in the business not have any idea what those might be?Clay's voice, well portrayed in "Measure of a Man", is turned into a whiny whisper on this CD.And while I don't mean to offend anyone, I really don't understand the reviews that have said this material is better than the originals. That's patently absurd. There isn't a single song on here that is better than the original, nor is there one that Clay full embraces (ok, maybe the Foreigner song - maybe) and makes his own.I think if all of the "Claymates" were honest with themselves they would realize that RCA did Clay a tremendous disservice.
A1ER0GJ8KHIW17	0	0	This book is badly written and a total mess. Most of all it's boring. I could barely get through it. I couldn't believe all the hype surrounding this book when it was released. It turns out the hype had to do with the fake author and not the work itself.I am disgusted with Laura Albert for using AIDS and HIV to further her own poorly written work.From gawker.com"In an email sent to Galleycat, JT Leroy's book agent, Ira Silverberg, comments on being completely duped into believing his client:"A good hoax is wonderful thing," literary agent Ira Silverberg emailed me this morning. "I'm all for it if doesn't hurt anyone." The false identity that "JT LeRoy" presented to the world, however, is the furthest thing from a "good" hoax in Silverberg's mind. "People were deceived in a brutal way: playing the AIDS card to elicit support, money, connections. That is simply unacceptable. It is morally reprehensible."And while pretending to have AIDS is, indeed, "morally reprehensible," parlaying that disposition into a friendship with Courtney Love, as Leroy did, is beyond human tolerance or comprehension."From nymag.com"Apparently, along with his multiple personalities, the disfiguring Kaposi's sarcoma he'd used as an excuse to stay hidden cleared up, and he stopped mentioning his HIV infection."From nytimes.com"Along the way Mr. Leroy gained the friendship and trust of celebrities and noted writers, who supported his career financially and offered him emotional support when he declared that he was infected with H.I.V."Dennis Cooper agrees - see below:From thefreelibrary.com"But queer writer Michelle Tea (Valencia, Rent Girl) responded and cared enough to pen a fiery open letter to the person impersonating JT, calling herself "grossed out" by the scam and castigating Albert. "If you had even used your giant scam for something other than schmoozing with B-list celebs," Tea wrote, "or writing shallow articles about couture footwear, and perhaps used your doomed moment in the spotlight to champion the actual heroic trans, HIV+, homeless or survivor youths making art under the celebrity radar, I could possibly applaud your exploitation. Now I just think you're a massive loser, as everyone who offered you a leg up in your social climbing surely does. Hope all the cash makes the total loss of your soul worthwhile."Dennis Cooper, for his part, wrote in his blog, "It's weird for me to think that I had one of the big hands in creating this monster. But let's hope that someday when the true ugliness of what Laura has done, especially to JT's most devoted fans, who are the real victims here, is assimilated and in recovery, the crazy and wacky aspects of the scare will let those of us who nudged it forward feel some amusement.""This list of quotes could go on for pages upon pages.
A1ER6MQ0L7NHNL	1	1	I've read the negative reviews on this razor, and I was prepared to be "let down" after getting the razor as a Christmas gift, but let me say that for the first time in a while, Philips-Norelco has come through and hit this one out of the park. I realize that some folks may have really thick beards and facial hair that makes it difficult for ANY electric shaver to give a very close, comfortable shave with minimal or no irritation. I understand and respect that. But for the majority of users with "normal" facial hair thickness and density, this shaver works and works well.Negatives:1.) cleaning it every one or two times due to the reduced "waste hair" capacity. However, let me say that it only takes about 30 seconds to rinse it under hot water, and then you are good as new. I can live with that.2.) small beard/sideburn trimmer. I'm used to the regular size beard and sideburn trimmers that are common on most Norelco razors; this one is about 1/3 the size. This is the "worst" negative for me, but I'll live with it, and just use one of my old razors for the trimmer if I have to.Positives:1.) less than a one hour charge time. The POS 7110XL razor that I use gives me maybe 20-25 minutes of shave time, then requires that I charge it for 8 hours. Great technology there, Philips. Even some other $100+ Norelcos that I have used take longer to charge than this one.2.) the head design and pivot features really work on stubborn neck hair. This is the primary reason why I love this razor. After about 6 shaves now, I get a shave as good as a razor and cream, and with less time and mess. Slap a little Lectric Shave on my face and away the 1050 goes giving me the best, closest shave I have ever gotten with any electric razor (Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.). Maybe it's just my facial hair "type", or maybe using the Lectric Shave helps that much more than the users that put no pre-shave on, but all I can tell you is that I get the results I've desired for a long time--a close shave with NO remaining neck and chin stubble--with NO irritation and spending less time doing it.In short, this is a great razor, not a perfect one, but a great one that does the job that I've long sought for a Norelco or any electric razor to do.
A1ER6MQ0L7NHNL	1	1	I always find it humorous (well, not really) when people criticize a $30 tripod and discuss how it won't meet the needs of folks looking for "motion-picture" video quality. Whatever. I bought this tripod to complement a camcorder used at my son's football and basketball games. I tested it out this weekend at one of them, and it was superb in performance and functionality. The panning was very smooth and maintained level very well. Attaching the base to the camera and configuring the tripod was as easy as it gets. I was impressed with the strength and barrel size of the aluminum legs . . . much better than other tripods in this price range. This tripod's height is what "elevates" it over other much more expensive tripods. The 54" or 57" heights of others don't cut it for what I needed a tripod for, but the Opteka more than delivered. I highly recommend this tripod for the casual user that needs versatility, functional ease, and durability.
A1ER6MQ0L7NHNL	0	0	I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my wife to put the kids' pictures in them. I saw all the mixed (though trending toward negative) reviews, but for just over $10, I figured what the heck. Now, I wished I'd heeded some of the comments. This thing would not get recognized in Vista SP1, constantly connecting then disconnecting with that oh-so-catchy USB jingle. There was no software CD provided. I tried everything I could to get my computer to see it, following the directions in the packaging plus some of those given in these reviews. Nothing, nada, zilch.This was the first and will likely be the last Coby product I purchase. Save your money or spend just a little extra to get a product that will actually work reliably for you.
A1ER6MQ0L7NHNL	0	1	I'd like to give this one 2.5 stars, but I'll round down due to how quickly this unit died on me (and others I have read about on the Interwebs). It's nice and compact with a vertical stubby charger that is better than most of the powered hubs (wish they'd learn to make the brick separate from the prongs, but oh well). Ports are tight together (almost a little too tight), but that is not uncommon for a 7-port hub. The price--around $27--is reasonable for a name brand port.The problem I had with this unit is that several times in the past, it became unrecognizable to Windows 7 (though it is fully compatible). However, last month, I had four devices that stopped working and refused to be recognized, despite no trauma to the unit, no voltage spikes, or no kid-induced tampering. The unit, which had been wonky a few times in the last year, completely died. I tried a new A-B USB 2.0 cable, tried a different plug, and heck, even tried everything in another location on a different computer. Still the same result. DLink's customer service on this unit is a joke, so don't even bother. Thank goodness I bought it with my AMEX Blue Cash card and got a 2-yr rather than just 1-yr warranty. Buyer beware (and it wasn't just me)!I bought the APC 7-port USB 2.0 hub--a vertical one with 2 front ports and 5 rear ones--and it works fabulously, and is $8 cheaper.
A1ER6R1VJI31G5	0	0	I watched this film with some friends a few weeks ago, and it was memorable due to the fact that it was the first time we all had ever agreed on anything. We all agreed that we had just witnessed a truely terrible film. The laughable plot is cliched from beginning to end - we were able to guess major 'twists' throughout the film without much difficulty. There is no depth to the story - the makers seems to have picked up the book 'How to make an action movie' and made a film (complete with villian with twitchy moustache) that followed it to the letter. The film was just so bad in the end it left us whincing. If you don't believe me, then buy the film and you'll see what I mean. Kurt Russell has no shame.
A1ER6R1VJI31G5	1	0	This DVD is the 'Directors Expanded' version of the film. I had only seen this film once prior to buying the DVD so cannot really comment on to what an extent the film had been 'expanded' by Michael Mann's re-editing. Though the film is good the DVD in general is let down by poor DVD extras. Namely none. The only features it boasts is THX sound and chapter selection which let's face it you get on every DVD anyway. I will say that despite a very lean DVD in terms of extras the actual film itself excellent - very enjoyable to watch. The story is a great one and the action is adrenaline pumping without showing too many human entrails. You do however have to suspend your disbelief once or twice - especially when Daniel Day-Lewis (very good as the white son of a mohawk) lapses into a puzzling Irishness in the climatic moments of the film (urgently screaming to a shocked Madeleine Stowe &quot;I will foind yoo no matter wot occurrrrs!&quot;) A recommended film to watch but you might want to wait for the DVD re-release of the original film in January 2001 to see what features that disc has to offer.
A1ERF1KD3KB41N	1	1	More like melting hearts cos thats what this dashing young man will do! My favourite type of hero: a dark dashing stranger with a dark past. I adored the way Miranda tried to get into her ruthlessly cold guardians heart. THe way she coaxed him to trust her, to give into her: its utterly breath-taking and heart-soaring. And in the end I love the way he gives into and sets his spirit free - dazzling! He's a trully amazing character who made me feel so sorry for him. He was going through hell and yet stayed so honourable. Gaelen Foley really showed what he was feeling to such a great effect and Miranda was such a strong character for such a young person.I especially adore the way Miranda releases him from his agony - sneaky Miranda! But seriously the characters are so genuine and serous in there feelign towards each other that you feel you might just weep with the unfairness in this real world! This is my favourite from all four of Foley's Knight Miscellany series. It's a satisfyingly charming read and is definitely recommended! A keeper!
A1ERF1KD3KB41N	1	1	I adored this book the plot is amazing as are the characters. They were amazing. I've never read about such an incredibly sensitive guy. Billy is amazing. He's had a rough childhood and desperately needs someone to love him and cherish him. I feel that Foley has done an outstanding job with Billy - His feelings are strong and true and you sympathise with him all the way through the book. I found it adorable the way he was afraid to love and be loved and Foley's writing brings out the best in this character. She's trully done wonders with him!Jacinda is just the right woman who will bring Billy out of the hole he's dug himself into. She's a breath-taking rebel who no longer wants to live with the ton breathing down her back. She longs to escape from th conventional society she's been trapped in for so long. And she does - straight into Billy's arms. THese two are delightful lovers and friends who you will just fall in love with!!! a MUST buy!
A1ERF1KD3KB41N	1	1	This book really deserves 6 stars!!! It is one of the best romance novels I have ever read (and I've read many!!!)! Lazar is so dashing, so charming, so irresistible! I love him, I love him, I love him: The world should be filled with men like him. He's such a great person and you can't help but fall heda-over heals in love with him. Even from the start of the book we realise what a great guy he is! He's amazing! He's really sensitve towards Allegra's feelings and the fact that he is a pirate on the verge of being king makes this book's plot fantastic!Allegra is a brilliant heroine too! I deeply admire her and I must say that I've probably never admired a person more! She's amzing the way she deals with things - especially at the end were she's treated as a whore heavy with child. She is the best woman for Lazar (as much as i loath saying that it must be said!!!) and Lazar is the best man for her.This book is charming and you'll find youself giggling at some parts and weeping at others!!! At least I did!I TRUE ROMANTIC NOVEL! A TRUE LOVE AND A TWO TRULLY BRILLIANT HEROES! IM SO JEALOUS OF THEM!!!!What a romance... sigh.RECOMENDED - A DAZZLING BREATH-TAKING NOVEL for all those who are as helplessly into romance as I - A KEEPER.
A1ERF1KD3KB41N	0	1	I found this book discouraging and a difficult read in the way that it rambles on and so its hard to get into. Its a book about the decisions we make in life and what causes us to make those decisions. Its about how we could change are decision if we had the power to go back in time. The novel focus's on the idea of eternal return - it focus's on the lives of 4 characters and how their lives revolve around each other and sex. Throughout the novel Kundera is continually questioning himself. He asks questions such as: which is better light/darkness, fineness/coarseness, warmth/cold, being/nonbeing all questions brought up by the Greek philosopher Parmedides. But Kundera focus's mainly on the question of: lightness/weight. In a way he tries to disprove Parmenides's theory that lightness is positive and weight is negative. Kundera corresponds his characters to either lightness or weight and by doing so explains how everyone is different. It's a sort of chinese, ying-yang, point of view of looking at life. Philosophically you can say that this book is addressing matters, that haven't been addressed before in such an outright manner, in a very new and intelligent way. But if you really think about it you realise that the author is getting a bit to carried away. Especially with sex.It seems to be the author's point of view that the only thing that is certain in life is sex. Sex is basically what the characters do throughout the novel. They try to figure things out, make decisions, etc. all with the idea of sex in their minds. Basically what Kundera says in his novel is that if someone is too light then the weight of the bed will bring them down. Quite frankly I don't believe that sex is everything in life - although it does play a major role - I think that people can depend on other things even if they aren't as enjoyable as sex.Finishing off: This book is also very depressing. Some characters are narrow minded and all characters are too philosophical - most people just don't think in that way - thats why I say that this book is depressing and makes us simple people feel wothless in a way. It gives a negative view on life but at the same time opens our eyes and makes us realise that everyone is different and that everyone is worth something. I also think this is a well written book and that Kundera's view should be taken into perspective.I recommend this book because it's good to know what other people think and what other people's outlook on life is. I don't recommend this book because as I said before it can be very depressing and quite frankly by the time I had finished it I was feeling very dismal. I didn't enjoy it. It's your choice - weigh out the pros and cons.
A1ERF1KD3KB41N	1	1	You simply mustn't miss the third bow-street runners book! Its amazing! Nick, our hero, has lived an awful life in the slums of London. He's been through jail and has suffered a lot there and yet he has managed to pull through, become rich and is slowly becoming more respectable due to the fact that he is now a bow street runner rather than what he was before in 'Lady Sophia's Lover', which was more or less a criminal.THis is a story about a broken man who needs the right women to put his spirit and life to rights again. He's avoided women and sex all his life until the age of twenty-five because of the disgusting things he saw whilst he was in jail. So at the age of twenty-five he goes to a courtesan who teaches all she knows about the act of love. Then after three years he is set a case by one of his employers to find his runnerway fiance - which he does of course, hears her story, marries her himself, and finally falls in love. I thought this was a brilliant story because Nick never believed in love before and needed Lottie to show him the way after his sad previous life. I like that Nick has had sex with two women in his life but has only made love to one - thats what he says.And the ending... Its just amazing... The way he admits his love for her is just breathtaking, believe me! RECOMMENDED!
A1ES633H01ZDHF	0	0	A double-disc special edition of one of the worst movies of all time? Give me a break, for pity's sake!!! The only double-disc special edition that would fit is a double MST3K.
A1ES6O8HDLMS83	1	1	I love these earrings. I think they're really pretty. Definitely not cheap/dinky looking, and definitely made of real silver. In Texas, James Avery is one of the most popular jewelry stores, and this is as good as anything you would buy there. Another good thing - they're not too heavy!
A1ES6O8HDLMS83	1	1	As a born and raised southerner, I got a kick out of this book. There were several phrases I'd heard and never thought about the origins of. There were also expressions that were new to me. The writing itself is hysterically funny, and there are many pokes at being southern in the book. Very enjoyable "dictionary."One word of caution - it's a small, short book! I didn't look at page count before I bought it, so I was expecting more.
A1ES6O8HDLMS83	1	1	Dr. Elsey and all the staff at Precious Cat - I owe you big!My 7 year old female has had litter box avoidance issues since I brought home the dog 4 years ago. (They're very good friends now.) After trying every product to remove urine smells/stains/etc, new and different litter boxes, countless cleaners, box liners, and litters, I finally stumbled upon this product. What an amazing difference! Everyone in my house is much happier now!Since switching to Cat Attract, we've had virtually no accidents - at least I haven't found/smelled any yet. Yes, this is expensive, but it's definitely worth it to me. We started with all Cat Attract in a lined box. It sounds like a commercial, but within 5 minutes of filling the box with this, the cat appeared and hopped right in! That may not be amazing to most of you, but to someone who hadn't had to clean the box in a week or two due to lack of use, it was a major event. The first week, I removed all the bedding/scratchers in the house that had catnip, because those apparently smelled similar enough that she thought those were okay to use, too.Since those first weeks, we've gradually switched to a 50/50 mix of this and Fresh Step Perfume Free/Dye Free, and we're still doing good. Emma-cat likes having a liner because the plastic of her box just wouldn't loose the smells, no matter how I cleaned 'em.For those who have problems with litter dust, this definitely has noticeably less dust than other litters as advertised. Is it totally and completely dust free? I don't think so, but for asthma sufferers, I imagine this is a good alternative.Also, check the Precious Cat website - they often have mail-in rebates. I got a bag for free. You can't beat that!
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	1	1	Ok, so the dude sounds a bit like elliott smith. As an EXTREME Elliott Smith fan, I don't think thats so bad. I do agree that before one buys this they should consider buying every elliott smith record out there. However, this stil has the guys own unique style..its the same with the band Earlimart (who is also accused of an "awful elliott smith rip off"). In my opinion, the more stuff that comes out that makes me remember elliott...the bettter, because we was one of the best pop songwriters of all time...and anyone that has tried to write something as gorgeous as some of his tunes...can vouch for that.
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	0	0	Why oh why did she have to come out with her own box set with her name on it....some of the best pieces of literature sold in a "box set" to get even more promotion for herself. Doesn't anyone else see that she is putting her name on one of the best authors of all time? doesn't this bother anyone else? this woman who's show is so fake and stupid. Faulkner is turning in his grave. I love Faulkner, he is a genius, and i'm sorry but i dont think that this is right.
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	1	1	At first glance, we wonder why Linklater directed this movie--however--the dialogue is very intellectual and very emotional sort of like Waking Life but in a more "real" perspective. It is a a modern tale of morality that asks "why" we say and do the things we do and what "forgiveness" and "maturity" really is. Throughout the film we side with different characters and we're not quite sure who is really "right." The film is truly a masterpiece that i would put alongside any Linklater film i've seen. The tension is insane, the twists are great, and the dialogue rivals my favorite dialogue movie of all time--Clerks (which is just as quick and brilliant). Fortunately for Linklater and his fan base..the movie focuses on motives, reasons, and moral philosophy. It is a film that can be enjoyed by both the highly intellectual part of you..and the side that wants to regress. Also, we have 3 characters. I characterize them as Moral..immoral..and The Judge. For most of the film, the viewer almost cannot decide one which one is moral and which one is immoral--the view changes constantly. I can't really express how well this movie was made and it certainly deserves much more recognition.
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	1	1	Ok, so I've only had this CD for about 2 hours....and i haven't even listened to the entire album, but i know that its going to grow on me a ridiculous amount. I love how Waits is a folk songwriter that decided to rape the genre up the rear with overdrive. I used to not be a fan of the man, but that was then and this is now. He has truly inspired probalby almost everyone's songwriting..for he is a great songwriter. He's not the bes guitar player but writes one great album--and that is what music is about. Folk is such strong, powerful, and yes, rocking music!! Tom Waits takes this literally as almost the entire album is sounded as if it was recorded at high levels so everything is distorted--but this works really really really well with this album. It sounds like its the only way it can be....because of how great it sounds. Its dissonant, its raw, its nasty, its the Primus of folk--Tom Waits.
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	1	1	Match Point is not about tennis or sports. It's also not a movie to see because Scarlett Johansen is in it. What it is, is a tragedy with a twist. I went into this thinking it would be a "Closer" like film--and though I do see the similarities in tone and feel--this film is different in it's own right. Has any reviewer ever read any tragic plays of Sophlocles? This reminds me of a Sophlocles play (indeed--the end has a magnificent quote from the man by the main character). The film does a good job at foreshadowing events to come by interspersing little hints throughout the film. Te ending is not a "shock" as everyone says but almost a logical conclusion in terms of classic tragedy. Many people will dislike this film, but I think that if one looks at it like one looks at an opera (which is a key aspect of the film) or tragic literature, then it will become a familiar yet unique experience. No film has ever been able to capture the tragedy of plays that i've seen--this comes very close.The only reason I have not given this film 5 stars is the fact that the film did not give me any sort of revelation. The films that are worth five stars are ones that you can take away from constantly throughout your entire life. I have a feeling that the reason I have not felt that it applies to my life all that much is that I am still young and have not truly felt the tragedy of love and reality. However, the film certainly impacted me and I will be coming back to it to think about little subtleties. In order to understand this film--one really has to think about why something is written that way/shot in that location/shot that way. It is a lot like good literature.
A1ESDH7ZIX6G8G	1	1	I have to admit, I have not read Phillip K. Dick (though I plan to very soon) so I don't know how well Linklater captured Dick's prose. However, what I do know, is that fans of Linklater's taking a conventional (or somewhat conventional/easy plot) and putting something INTO the screen. A lot of films one sees now, you see the preview and the premise of the film and your intrigued by what it is about. However, when you get to the theater, of course, the film does a poor job at what surrounds the story and theme. Linklater is not a plot fanatic....most of his films involves highly energetic, intellectual conversation that sometimes borders on nonsense (which should be expected from the fact that they are all on drugs). One person mentioned that the serious overtone of drug use is not protrayed well, but by the end of the film i felt the pain and the cyclical nature of drug use. What I mean is that, though the film is often times filled with humor, it is a humor one pities and laughs because it makes them uncomfortable that someone could possibly be seeing these things/feeling these things/saying these things. However, how could Linklater (or indeed, Dick) should the hindsight of the drug use throughout the entire film...it would be an entirely different film. Any film about drugs always has the era where the drug use is euphoric and the users are having a good old time. It is exactly this transition from "stoner comedy" to "drama" that jerks the viewer around a bit and realizes that all these things that the former attitude was false if it is compared to the everyday reality of existence. Tragedy in this film is chased with a heavy glass fo comedy in order to satirize both the war on drugs and the drug users themselves. Ultimately, it is not a happy ending--how can drugs and addiction have a happy ending? The film leaves you with a sorrowful overtone for the all the characters that are destroying themselves with drugs.Also, and again, this is just an opinion, I liked the random shifts in how the story was portrayed. We got that "voice over" part that was most likely an internal monologue written by Dick that Linklater really wanted to put in, but he did not want to go strictly "voice over" technique because it is an overused technique in film.I"m not saying that I think this film is the best film for everyone and anyone. I loved this film, but of course it isn't a universal classic. However, I'm sure that this film will because a cult classic among people who love interesting movies. Some films just hit you and your just like "wow, that was a great movie, I could tell you why, but it will pretty much take as long as the film was." A film that can be discussed on many levels, A Scanner Darkly does not dissapoint.Note: though I do believe that Keanu Reeves cannot really express too much emotion and whatnot...I do believe that this was good for the movie. The character doesn't seem to have much left in him...he looks very out of it. Reeves achieves this really well in my opinion.
A1ESGC5DPJCKON	1	1	After reading this book, I realized just how much pressure must be on Kindergarten teachers today. There are expectations put upon them to prepare children academically for first grade when so many of them were not prepared for today's Kindergarten in the first place. From then on, it's a snowball effect in which each subsequent teacher is trying to catch every child up on academic standards. What ever happened to preparing them for life?Einstein said, "Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.", and this book follows that train of thought. As more time passes, play is devalued more and more... then people wonder why children have to critical thinking and problem solving skills. It's evident that so much can be learned through fantasy play and storytelling... much more than simply learning what you need to pass a test.Reading this book renewed my hope for what Early Childhood Professionals can do in classrooms to get back their roots in play. I highly recommend reading this if you work with young children or have children of your own!
A1ESGC5DPJCKON	0	0	We bought this at a wholesale warehouse store b/c we were in need and it was cheap. Big mistake. It worked okay for the first couple of months, and then things just randomly and inconsistently stopped working on it. Sometimes moving the plugs around helped, but ultimately we replaced it with a much better model from another company and have had way better results!
A1ESGC5DPJCKON	0	0	I guess this is the case of you get what you pay for. I received this in the mail today (3/17/2012) and was ready to set it up. I plugged in my source cable and plugged in my Astro Gaming Mixamp 5.8 TX puck, and it did not work. I tested all 3 cables to ensure they worked. All 3 cables work. I then switched the splitter around and it still did not work. I did have a laser going across the entire contraption, but no sound. I am not entirely sure why it did not work. I tested this splitter on another device and it did not work there either. This product is busted!
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	It's not historically accurate, blah, blah, blah.Mel's been acting like a doo-doo head lately, blah, blah, blah.Now that we have that out of the way, "Braveheart" remains a masterfully entertaining film.Gibson presents a near perfect cinematic balance of emotion: love, passion, loss, humor, sadness and triumph in this epic-sized story about a guy from the 13th century who's righteously pi**ed off and courageously turns the tables on his oppressors.From start to finish, this film looks fantastic in Blu-ray compared to the DVD - unlike too many other movies that are poorly transferred to high definition, there is no noise in any of the nightime/shadow or foggy scenes.For fans of bonus materials, these are (mostly) also presented in high-def."Braveheart" on Blu is definitely worth the price of upgrading.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	"Rob Roy", released around the same time as the epic "Braveheart", was in a similar vein to the latter, and was eclipsed by it.If you liked "Braveheart", you should enjoy this movie - it doesn't have large gory battle sequences or as many humorous moments, but it has stellar character performances from Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange and Eric Stoltz as the good guys, and equally stellar performances from John Hurt, Brian Cox and especially Tim Roth as the bad guys. Actually, the Archie Cunningham character in "Rob Roy" is probably Tim Roth's best turn as villain ever.Anyway, my review is for the Blu ray transfer, which is a big improvement over the original DVD release. The opening static splash shot is ominously grainy, but the movie itself looks fine.For me, the acid test was the dank "castle" (?) scene where we first encounter Roth's character. The original DVD of that dark scene was awash in film noise and looked pretty bad. It is much improved on the Blu release.Though not as good overall as the Blu release of "Braveheart" (which looks awesome in high def), for the money, "Rob Roy" on Blu is worth the upgrade if you are a fan.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Didn't know what to expect for under $10, but it proved to be worth the gamble.This cable appears to be well constructed and it works fine for me(amateur use, infrequent setup/teardowns).It's a decent 15 feet long, and has a locking button on the female end.I'm quite happy with it.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use - it would probably fall apart fairly quick "on the road" or if it were adjusted constantly.That being said, it's a great little stand for low duty/home use. I'm using it with a Blue enCORE 100 microphone, which isn't really heavy, but still weighs close to a pound. This stand holds it very sturdily, and with the boom feature, it can be set up in just about any position I would ever need.If you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget, this is a decent stand.And for less than $25 bucks, it's a bargain.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Yes, it is somewhat derivative - the "Spirit of the West" is obviously an homage Clint Eastwood. Noticed that the "Beans" character looks unsettlingly like the 'baby' in "Eraserhead". The biggest nod is to "Chinatown", with which "Rango" ultimately shares a very similar plot (Dirt's mayor and John Huston's character in "Chinatown" look alike, sound alike, and even share some lines).Still, "Rango" entertains from start to finish, and belongs in any computer animation fan's library. Just stunning visuals - fur/hair textures that were very difficult to achieve in films as recent as "Monsters, Inc." and "The Incredibles" abound in "Rango", and seem to be effortless at this point.There's just so much to absorb in this film, it's worth multiple viewnings.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This is for people considering the Godfather/Godfather II Two pack in Blu-ray format.What you get for $20 is the first two movies only, with no special features other than the original director commentary.These are same "Coppola Restoration(s)" as the pricier set that includes Godfather Part III and an additonal disc of bonus features.Are they as sharp and sound intensive as contemporary films on Blu-ray? No.Are they better than the earlier DVD versions? Yes. There is still film grain and high contrast here, but this is the nature of the source material. What you won't see are the artifacts that cropped up on lower capacity DVDs.As other reviewers have said, if you want the best transfers of these particular, seminal films, this is it. If you watch them in a darkened room you will get as close to the original circa 1970's theater experience of these films as you ever will get, and this is a good thing.I would have liked the additional features in the more expensive set, but you have to buy all three movies to get the extras. Like many people, I am not a fan of Godfather III, so for $30 less, I got these two classics.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	0	"Cloverfield" is a neat take on the giant monster running amuck theme.The film is presented as recovered camcorder footage shot by some unfortunate eyewitnesses.The whole story of how the camcorder got into a certain person's hands and the peripheral events leading up to the monster's rampage are cleverly done. Out of the small group of people that the film follows, I found myself pulling mainly for the clown behind the camera. Hud's story was the most poignant.Though the movie has many dramatic moments, there's a lot of humor in here, and when the main theme plays during the end credit roll, you get the feeling that they didn't take themselves too seriously, and I think that's why the film works.Most people that slammed this movie had objections to the way it was shot, but I thought the "Blair Witch" style of shooting worked well considering how the story is told. The destruction special effects seemed pretty darn realistic. It was the monster itself that I found kind-of unconvincing. It reminded me of the Rancor beast that Luke takes on in Star Wars Episode 6 (interestingly enough, Phil Tippett was involved in both projects). Plus, there are bound to be comparisons to "Godzilla".You never find out the "why" of "Cloverfield", but the ride itself is exhilarating.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	****Update notes at 1+ year markThis unit still operates fine, with a couple of concerns:-Over the 1+ year I've owned it, I believe it's getting louder when running - hopefully this is not indicative of a looming problem (like I said, it still cooks fine).-The clock on the unit runs about a minute fast! Never experienced this with a digital clock before, but this one will gain about a minute a month. Strange.********My original review:I've had this microwave for several days now, and it has worked fine.What's nice:- Brushed stainless steel exterior is pretty slick looking.- Stainless interior should be easier to maintain than microwaves that have enameled interiors (just wish the interior surfaces weren't so shiny).- Door has a refrigerator-type handle, which for some reason I like better than the typical microwave button-press doors.- Lots of ventilation openings on the microwave = less condensation inside the oven compartment (my old microwave was like a soaked sponge on the inside).- Loud beeper can be heard over household din (see below).- First six numeric buttons correspond to "Express Cook" times = one button operation for most of my microwave cooking needs. Can fine tune with "+30 sec" button to make those pizza rolls just right.- The rest of the buttons are clearly marked and easy to understand.- Overall operation is reasonably quiet compared to what others have posted here(much quieter than my old microwave).- Instruction booklet is short, but well written.What's not so nice:- As far as I can tell, that loud beep tone cannot be adjusted, so I can see how it would annoy some.- There is an "AM/PM" button whose sole function appears to be to tell the user if the time displayed is AM or PM - strange. It would have been much handier to have a button that incrementally controls the beeper volume...- Power is 1,000 watts, and turntable diameter is 12.4" - may be a bit underpowered and smallish for some users.- Needing to pay for return shipment on warranty repair is not fair. (California residents have a more flexible warranty)I bought this item assuming that in this case, since Cuisinart is still manufacturing and selling this model, they either tightened quality control or the vast majority of people who own this oven have been happy, and just haven't written "pro" reviews on Amazon.I will change my review if needed, but so far, so good...
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This is an excellent resource that belongs in every keyboard player's library.The book starts with a nice tutorial on basic chord theory.The "encyclopedia" part of the book is great, because they include a chord diagram, both treble and bass notation for the chord, and a picture of the treble fingering. They even spell out the notation, so if your sight reading skills aren't the best, you can still read the chord.One thing to note is that the book is only about 5&1/2" x 8", so the diagrams and pictures are on the smallish side. This was probably done to save costs. For a reference work, I would have gladly paid a higher cost for a larger format.Another thing to note is that there are some errors in here - for example, the chord chart for E first inversion (pg 132)shows G# as the first note, and in the accompanying photo, the thumb is playing a G. Hopefully there are few such errors.*******Note to Kindle Users:This book is also available in Kindle format.The diagrams look "ok" on the Kindle Fire (again smallish), but when you zoom them, they are very low res. Too bad...
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	It's always great to discover a pianst that treats ragtime with the respect it deserves.Richard Dowling's performance is elegant and he plays most of these pieces at a palatable tempo (i.e., not at breakneck speed), so you can really savor the unique beauty of each tune.As for the repertoire, we are given a generous collection, some which seem to be mandatory inclusions (Maple Leaf Rag), but mostly these are tunes you won't find in every other ragtime collection.For me, the Graceful Ghost rag was a real treat, as I love this piece and have only heard it recorded once before, by William Bolcom himself.Oddly, my least favorite in this recording was Dowling's take on the Maple Leaf, probably because it appears on just about every other ragtime collection I own.As a whole though, this is a real treat for ragtime piano fans.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I bought this set primarily for the 'Jesse James' movie, which is dark, slow paced and cerebral, and features fine acting by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. This film may bore you if you are looking for action or plot twists, and you'll know if it's right for you after about the first 15 or so minutes. If you can stick with it, Casey Affleck's smoldering performance is a revelation.I had not seen "Wyatt Earp" before and it proved to be quite a pleasant surprise. It came out a year after "Tombstone" and wasn't as successful I guess, but this film strikes a good balance between being too violent or too fawning/watered down. It pretty much follows the same main storyline as "Tombstone" with the addition of showing events that mold the younger Wyatt into the man he becomes by the time he arrives at Tombstone.Dennis Quaid does a good job with the Doc Holliday role, but Val Kilmer's performance will always be more memorable.The movie clocks in at a bit over three hours, however it never dragged for me.The cinematography in "Wyatt Earp" is beautiful, and the Blu-ray transfer is excellent - there are many dark/shadowy scenes that are rich in detail and have very little or no noise. The frequent daytime panoramas are gorgeous. Warner did a wonderful job here.If you want to add two very different, good westerns to your Blue-ray collection, this combo set is a steal.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	"Breaking Bad" is primarily a crime story, told from the perspective of a criminal, however it in no way glorifies the crime or the criminal. Yet this show skillfully tackles so many other topics - the less you know about it, the more impactful I think the subplots would be.The first episode lead me to believe that this was going to be a comedy, and while most of the episodes do have some pretty funny moments, this is at its heart a finely crafted drama.There's a reason Bryan Cranston keeps winning Emmys for his portrayal of Walt White, but the rest of the cast is superb, especially Aaron Paul. These two make the most compelling odd couple you are ever likely to see on television.If you read the the one star reviews here, you will see that most of them aren't knocking the show, but the number of episodes in the first season (only 7). The price on the first season has come down to being reasonable, and I will definitely watch these episodes again, they're that good.My only hope is that this series doesn't fizzle out on poor writing, but ends while it's still at the top of its game.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Please note that this album isn't exclusively Ragtime - it also contains some stride/jazz pieces.If Ragtime is what you are after, check out Richard Dowling's other album,World's Greatest Piano Rags. It's excellent.When Dowling sticks to the original compostion, the results are very pleasing. He does at times take a different tact to playing certain phrases - occasionally swapping legato for staccato (and vice-versa), and this gives him a kind-of signature sound (he doesn't do this excessively).It's when he takes more of an artistic license with embelishments that I'm tempted to hit the fast forward button. For example, his excursions on "The Entertainer" seem rather dubious to me.For the most part though, this album is quite listenable (especially liked "Handful of Keys" and "Magnetic Rag").
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Breaking Bad's second season is darker than the first. There are some humorous moments (usually at Jesse's expense), but overall this season is much more "intense"."The Sopranos" and "Boardwalk Empire" are entertaining crime dramas, but they don't pull me in the way this show does. I know of no other TV series or movie about an illegal enterprise where you actually witness the "business" being put together, almost in real time, while the law desperately scrambles to stop it. That whole process in itself makes for fascinating viewing.Again, this series in no way glorifies drug taking or drug trafficking (quite the opposite), and it's pretty interesting how they manage to make this seem so viscerally realistic without excess profanity or violence.I don't want to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to be amazing together onscreen. Anna Gunn gets more screen time, as do Dean Norris and RJ Mitte - and this season they further prove how great the entire cast is.I'll just conclude by saying that the last episode of season two is heartbreaking to watch, but up to this point, Breaking Bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen and definitely merits repeated viewing.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Like seasons 1 and 2, Breaking Bad season 3 is some of the most interesting entertainment you're likely to see on television. This series continues to be thrilling and thought provoking.There's very little fluff in this show - most of what you see is relevant to the arc of the story, and more and more there are connections drawn between past episodes and current ones, tying everything neatly together. Careful viewing reveals nods between episodes, and I love this attention to detail in the script.As I noted in the previous two seasons, the acting all around is superb, but much of the success of this show is due to Bryan Cranston in his portrayal of Walter White.****Spoiler****My favorite episode in season three is "Kafakaesque". The scene where Walter's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) spins a story about how Walter can manage to cover Hank's hospital bills is just amazing to watch if you've seen all the previous episodes up to this point. Bryan Cranston's facial expressions and body language during this scene alone prove why he keeps deserving the Emmy.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	To this day, "Deliverance" (along with "Blue Velvet and "Blood Simple") is one of the most bizarre mainstream movies you are likely to see.It's a distinctive suspense thriller with a simple plot and great acting that has stood the test of time.The Blu-ray transfer is very good for a movie of this vintage - there is no noise whatsoever in most of the dark & shadowy scenes, BUT they really had trouble with the scene where Jon Voight's character scales the rock cliff - this sequence is plagued with all manner of artifacts. Overall, still worth getting if you are a fan of this film.The disc also includes an interesting retrospective (in standard def).I hadn't seen this movie in a long time and DID have to laugh at some of the continuity errors here, considering the budget and attention to detail otherwise.My favorite is the sequence early in the film when the foursome initially set off in their canoes - Ronny Cox's hat magically disappears and reappears several times - it's clearly two different takes that were cut & pasted together. Pretty funny.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	If you love Early Music, you simply can't go wrong with Jordi Savall.If you are new to this music, just listen to the samples.This album is pure balm for the soul, a treasure for your collection, which you'll return to again and again.And for the price of ONE import CD, you can download TWO Jordi Savall MP3 albums from Amazon - to my ear, they sound perfect. Yeah!
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This is a great deal for two of the games alone - Five Card Deluxe, check out the trial downloadFive Card Deluxe [Download] and the first version of Flip Words (there is a Flip Words 2 also available).I'm sure the other games will be fun, but for the price, I bought this primarily to have a back up copy of Five Card Deluxe - I like the game that much!
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Considering that this game is over 10 years old it's still a nice package.Note that:-***I don't know how (or if) it would run under Windows 7***, but it installed quick and runs fine on my Vista based laptop. The Help files are not supported under Vista, but I guess I can always fire up my old XP machine if I really needed to - the Video Poker game is pretty self explanatory, but there are sections about the "21" games I'd like to read.-You DO need to keep the disc in the drive to play the games! This is a bone of contention with a lot of folks. Doesn't bother me.The Good Stuff:-The graphics & sound for the Video Poker games are pretty nice, again when you take into consideration that this is a 10+ year old game. I've seen recent offerings that are a lot worse!-The game window is scalable & the graphics stay sharp no matter how big you make the window. Sweet!-There are many variations of the multi-play game, and you can play a single line if you wish (unfortunately this doesn't appear to be the case with the spin poker games).-When you leave the game & come back, the last game variation you played comes up, so you don't have to hunt down your favorite.-There are a number of training options and game mechanic tweaks you can make if you are so inclinded.-As a bonus, you also get Blackjack and Spanish 21 card games, and each of these games has a supporting video clip.-As a bonus bonus, this also includes graded strategy drills for Blackjack and even card counting drills if you want to go there.All in all, if you like Video Poker and/or Blackjack, have a Vista (or older) based system and can find this disc at a reasonable price, it's worth hunting down!
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I own several Masque titles that I've bought for next to nothing, and I've found that aside from being able to vary the number of computer opponents (I haven't seen a Masque game yet that allows you to change the number of opponents)the games by Masque are superior to their Hoyle counterparts, which concentrate more on bells and whistles than gameplay.For a little bit of money, you get a lot of nice games, something of interest for almost any age group - granted, the graphics & sounds are a bit dated, but I've seen worse, and you do have the option to change the look of the cards, tiles, and in some cases the playing background.I loaded this game on a Vista Based computer, and it plays fine - you have the choice of which game(s) you want to install, and if you install the whole ball of wax, you can run the game without keeping the disk in the drive. The Help files work fine in Vista (several older games I own have Help files that are incompatible with Vista).The main reason I bought this title was for the card game selection - Includes: Spades, Hearts, Whist, Euchre, Canasta, Cribbage, Gin Rummy, Rummy, Old Maid, Crazy 8's and Go Fish among others.The Solitaire Antics game has tons of different variations of solitaire, with lots of game options, including the ability to see valid moves if you want, and a no moves left warning.The Mahjongg Tile game is probably the weakest of the three for me simply because I have a version on my Kindle Fire (Random Mahjongg) that has spoiled me for other Mahjongg games. If you are new to Mahjongg, the Masque Mahjongg game is a great place to start.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	A professional or highly experienced poker player may have a legitimate gripe against this or any mass marketed computer poker game simulation, but if you are on a budget and would like to learn the basic nuts and bolts of poker(hand values, how bidding works, etc.), then World Class Poker is your best current choice.Granted, this ain't the same as playing against real people, but a beginner is bound to start thinking more strategically after playing for a few hours and you're not out anything except the cost of the game.Unlike the games offered by Hoyle and other mass publishers, this program concentrates on the game itself, and not a bunch of bells and whistles. That doesn't mean to say it is bland, either - the menus and environments are very classy looking, and the cards are big and easy to read.One very nice touch is that at the end of a hand, the dealer announces the contender hands and the winning hand.Along with Texas Hold `em(with no limit as well as variable limit options) World Class Poker offers Seven Card Stud and and Five Card Draw with limit options, so for learning players, there's a lot of fun here. Note that aside from a heads up option in the no limit Texas Hold `em game, the number of computer opponents cannot be changed by the user (this is the only feature that most Hoyle games have, and I wish World Class Poker had this option).
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	0	Here's the story of a guy who made an estimated thirty million dollars during his life by gambling. He spent his last days mooching money off his associates and died at the age of 45 from health issues related to drug abuse- they took up a collection to pay for his funeral.I give the authors a lot of credit for writing a gripping and compassionate yet honestly told story - you probably won't despise Stuey, but you won't admire him either.Some call this a cautionary tale, but sadly it is bound to be repeated time and again when someone is born with immense natural talent and no common sense.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I loved the first three seasons of "Breaking Bad". I know of no other show where you see the main character's motivations evolve in real time. The attention to the nuts and bolts of running an illicit business and the ramifications thereof may be boring for some, but for me it's what sets this show apart from all other crime dramas. The actors and writers deserve every award they've earned for this show.That being said, this season was not my favorite because it seemed to trend towards sensationalism (first with Gus' revenge plot on the cartel, then the poisoning of the boy, then with the final, unbelievable special effects shot of Gus at the hospital, which looked like it was inspired by the movie "The Quick And The Dead"), which tells me that the writers may be running out of steam.Overall, season 4 was still quite entertaining (Aaron Paul's best) and worth seeing again, and aside from a few loose ends, season 5 will pretty much start with a clean slate, so it will be interesting to see where they take the show.Like I said before though, as much as I love "Breaking Bad," I hope they have the strength to pull the plug before the series takes a major tailspin.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I just stumbled across this rarity through a seller on Amazon Marketplace.This is one of the only two "Blues Jumpers" albums with Eldridge Taylor handling vocals.After the stellarWheels Start Turning, Eldridge and the band appear to have parted ways (where is Eldridge Taylor now?)Oddly, it almost seems as if Eldridge's singing takes a back seat to the band on this very brief Christmas album, but don't get me wrong, the result is highly enjoyable, though I'll probably appreciate it more come Christmastime!Anyway, if you liked "Wheels Start Turning," this is well worth seeking out while there are still a few copies left out there.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This is typical of most "Original Soundtrack" CD compilations - some of the tracks you will immediately recognize, some will sound vaguely familiar, and other tunes you'll swear were never in the movie.If you liked the music while watching "Get Shorty," you will like this CD - the tracks fit together. Fun to pop into your player for a change of pace every now and then.Yes, as others have said, the long version of "Stink" has a dubious vocal overdub that will most likely leave you scratching your head, but a shorter, unblemished version of the tune is also included.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	This album is very different sounding when compared toWheels Start Turning- vocalist Haywood Gregory replaced Eldrige Taylor, there's more guitar, and the album has more of a 50's early-rock/boogey feel to it.Interesting that they chose to redo "Jim Beam"."Data Access Blues" is pretty funny, and kind-of spoils the illusion that we are listening to a vintage recording.Still, it's a rolicking, delightful album that will not dissapoint you if you can find it.After only 3 releases, looks like the band had gone their separate ways, and I wish them all well, wherever they are. True musicians one and all.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	First off, I took a gamble and picked this up on Blu for a couple bucks cheaper than Amazon's current price. Picture & sound quality are superb. If you are a fan of this movie, you'll love the transfer.For an adult Sci-Fi movie fan, I thought this was far better than the likes of "Cowboys vs. Aliens," (which wasn't bad) and "Real Steel," (which was really bad).The movie is derivative (you will detect elements of "Stand by Me," "E.T.," "Gremlins," etc.) but it does have a good, plausible storyline for a sci-fi film, with decent performances by the (mostly adolescent)cast.It isn't as gritty as "Cloverfield," nor is it quite as heartwarming as "E.T.," but like those films, it is good sci-fi entertainment, and well worth taking a chance on if you haven't seen it yet.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Face it, the only things we learned from Star Wars Episodes I-III are that aunt Beru was a real hottie back in the day, Jar Jar Binks should have stayed on the drawing board, and someone should have risked getting fired and stopped George from casting the role of young Anakin Skywalker.If you want REAL Star Wars, then you are talkin' episodes IV-VI.We're talkin' Alec Guinness/Mark Hamill/Carrie Fisher/Harrison Ford Star Wars, we're talkin' the Force before all of that midichlorian crap Star Wars.Even though George couldn't leave well enough alone and had to dink around with 'em (what I call the "Mark of Cutesy"; you know, alien poo-poo jokes, etc., additional sophomoric stuff to try and tow these classics down to the level of episodes I-III) the original trilogy looks and sounds stellar on Blu Ray.If you are a fan of the original three films and want to see them in most likely the best condition we'll ever see short of going to the theater, then this is it. The detail and texture of many scenes are a revelation. John William's music sounds awesome.Note that the price you pay for just the original trilogy alone is that you do not get any of the special bonus stuff included in the entire "Saga" set, but for me, it ain't worth triple the cost and three additional boat anchor films which I will never ever watch again, even sails to the wind, or if someone paid me a million billion dollars even.One star off for the aforementioned "Mark of Cutesy," and I don't care if they re-re-re-release these films on Blu in their original form. I'm not putting any more money into George's pocket...
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	0	1	Ironically, George Lucas has become the Emperor that his movies rail against.With unlimited resources and absolute control, Star Wars prequel episodes I-III are successive duds when compared to the original trilogy.Episode I makes us suffer through Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker. You really can't blame the actor - he was hand-picked by George. There's a segment in one of the bonus features (on my Episode I DVD, not in this Blu ray 3 pack) that shows Lucas intently scrutinizing one of Lloyd's performances. What is going on in the man's mind is unfathomable, but the end result is dismal.Then we have Jar Jar Binks, probably the most universally despised computer animated character that will ever grace a big budget movie. There is no doubt that George must have been aware of the avalanche of negative feedback this character generated in Episode I, yet as if to thumb his nose at the fans, he sticks ole Lizard Boy in episodes II & III (albeit to diminishing degrees).The last straw for me, Episode I -wise, was the inclusion of the concept of "midichlorians" as a physical, measurable component of The Force. Here, Lucas takes one of the best "less is more" concepts in all of moviedom and unnecessarily pollutes it.Episodes II and III fare little better.George Lucas' best work was done when he was under pressure and had a limited budget to work with (American Graffiti and the original Star Wars). The franchise also proved very successful when he farmed out the director duties (The Empire Strikes Back).Unfortunately what we have at this point is a spoiled kid, gleefully shoveling sprinkles onto his ice cream, and the resulting gaudy concoctions induce a belly ache.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I like solitaire games, but I especially like "episodic" solitaire games, where you have to win in order to progress towards some higher goal.The Jewel Quest series of solitaire games offer just that - plus you have the option of playing just the card game, or the "Full Quest," which includes a mini game involving the original Jewel Quest board (basically a match 3 type game). This first Jewel Quest Solitaire game has two "books" of different solitaire layouts, and a number of special wild cards are introduced as you progress up the levels. You can also undo some of your last few moves (including wild card moves), and if you are quick enough, you can also undo your very last move if you lost the hand - even with this amount of leeway, you'll still run into plenty of "oh, darn" moments when you lose by one card.This game is just challenging enough where you probably won't plow through and complete it in a couple of days, nor is it too frustrating to make you give up, either - it's just hard enough to be compelling and fun for short breaks- my idea of the perfect casual game.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	0	This movie is like a cross between "Cliffhanger," "Deliverance," and "Alien".I'm not normally squeamish about confined spaces, but some of the "tight" shots in this film are so well done that you could just sense the distress the characters were experiencing. Really edge-of-your-seat stuff.Added to that, this film is a couple notches above the typical pick 'em off one at a time horror film. Like "Alien," it is well paced, and the characters have some dimension.One star off for the Blu-ray transfer - there's some crystal shots, but most of the story takes place in a dimly lit cave - Hi Def Digest says "Chroma noise is also not an issue" in this film, but I beg to differ.Unless there are different transfers available for this film, there's a lot of video noise in many scenes.Still one to own, or at least worth seeing at least once if you are a fan of scary/thriller films.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	"Boardwalk Empire," HBO's period drama centering on Prohibition era Atlantic City continues to entertain through the whole of season two. As Nucky`s world starts unraveling on all fronts, this season has many intense and memorable scenes and interesting plot twists. I found it to be more compelling than season one, and season one was pretty darn good.The supporting cast is top notch (Dabney Coleman and Paz de la Huerta are superb in their respective roles), and it was a treat to see the much underutilized William Forsythe in the role of Manny Horvitz.My favorite character was Jimmy Darmondy (Michael Pitt). One of the most conflicted characters ever.*****One thing that strikes me as odd is the choice of theme music for this show. "Boardwalk Empire" is one of the most lavish productions ever broadcast on television, and from the set designs to the costumes, they obviously took great pains to stay accurate to the period.Yet I always chuckle when the show starts with that electric-guitar drenched blues/rock-style theme. The soundtrack for the show itself is rich with period music, or at least music that seems appropriate for the era being portrayed. The "Boardwalk Empire" theme music, though, seems way out of place - sounds like it was second runner up to the theme used for "Sons of Anarchy".
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	0	0	Wow, this didn't even seem like a Ridley Scott film.For a laundry list of what's wrong here, you can read the other in-depth reviews, but the image of a couple of the main characters trying to outrun the path of a rolling spacecraft instead of dodging off to either side pretty much sums it up. The most ineptly manned trillion dollar mission ever.This film also underscores just how important a good soundtrack is. Go back and listen to how effective the soundtrack to the original "Alien" film is in supporting the awe, suspense and horror of the visuals. The soundtrack for "Prometheus" just doesn't cut it.Though I will watch this movie again for the sets and cinematography, it's too bad "Prometheus" has more in common with "Alien Resurrection" than Ridley's original classic.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	I don't consider myself to be a big fan of westerns, but "Deadwood" is a show that I've never tired of after several viewings - I can watch the entire series (3 seasons) every year or so - great story, great cast, great acting.Be forewarned that this is not a "family" show, nor is it for the faint of heart - almost every episode is laced with profanity, violence and all manner of illicit activity. It would be easy to write this show off as gratuitous, but at its core, "Deadwood" has compelling, extremely well written storylines (at least for the first two seasons). On the one hand, it's too bad they didn't tone down some of the "raw" aspects of this show because it may have garnered a bigger audience (most of the negative reviews you'll see here are for series' abrasive content), but then on the other hand it wouldn't be "Deadwood" without it. In the extra features, Milch and company do explain why the show is presented the way it is - also telling is Milch's lament as to why the series was terminated after just three seaons (credit to HBO for including Milch's "rant" in the extras).If you can look past the "grit," the first two seasons of "Deadwood" rank amongst the finest shows HBO has ever offered. Less so the third season, but it is still watchable.Anyway, I'm glad I held out until the complete series came to Blu Ray - it just looks and sounds stellar. All of the bonus features from the various DVD collections have been ported over, and it looks like they are all in hi-def too. Not critical, but a nice perk. If you keep an eye out, this series can be purchased on Blu for around $60, which is an absolute steal for the entertainment it provides.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	`People will do anything for a potato'When I think about the films of Steven Spielberg, "Empire of the Sun" ranks among my all-time favorites by this director.There's so much to take in here, from the story and acting to the sets and cinematography that "Empire of the Sun" is also one of my all-time favorite films, period.Set during World War II, the story centers around Jamie, a boy from a well-to-do British family living in Shanghai. When the movie begins, we witness events in Jamie's idyllic life - he's spoiled and takes advantage of those charged with his care. After hostilities escalate between Japan and China, Jamie becomes separated from his family, and the remainder of the movie deals with the boy's ability to survive on his own in a drastically different environment.You may never quite warm up to Jamie (played perfectly by an adolescent Christian Bale), but you have to admire his ability to adapt. Like him or not, the final scene in "Empire of the Sun" should bring a tear to your eye.If you are a fan of this movie, you will be blown away by the quality of the Blu Ray transfer! An incredible amount of fine detail that was missing from the original DVD is revealed in this transfer -I was struck by a scene early in the film where Jamie comes upon a downed fighter plane - you see all the wear and tear the aircraft went through. Color(check out the "costume party" scene) and contrast and sound are excellent. A must-have!
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	0	You either love Frankie's seemingly helium-induced falsetto or you don't.For those of us that do, this album provides a good Frankie/4 Seasons fix, as it contains most of the hits you knew and loved growing up. Sound quality is fine, given the vintage of the material.There are a couple of odd tracks - most notably the cover of &#34;Don't Think Twice,&#34; which is good for a laugh, but I usually skip it.
A1ESUYMIG3TZT0	1	1	Seriously, these `bowl' recordings by Karma Moffett really click with me. They are beautifully done and have an incredible amount of dimension for stereo recordings. I own/have sampled other recordings of "bowls," but none of them sound as alive as this recording and Moffett's similarly titledGolden BowlsThese two recordings differ from each other in that "Golden Bowls" tends to center more on deep/low tones, and "Golden Bowls of Compassion" has a more even mix of high/low tones right from the start.Both recordings are just incredible sounding on systems that have a subwoofer, though.I'd like to see or read just what hardware they used to make these recordings and how they placed the mics - they are that amazing!
A1ESYWD9UOMMNE	1	1	YES THIS HAS ALL THE HITS , SEVENTEEN MADALAINE MILES AWAY ....ETC ETC.TO MY SURPRIZE THE NEW SONG IS BRILLIENT AND COULD BE THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM.

This Rocks...i was never an ozzy fan but this is brilliant , ive got motley crue dokken n' sammy hagar on dvd , but this is by far the best , the 5;1 mix is unbeleivable, the camaras angles are great , and what a great set , all it needed was miricle man n' perry mason to be perfect , but zak plays a bit of miricle man in his solo. Its worth every cent , im an ozzy fan forever , is there a better DVD?
A1ET9ZCY9RDPS0	0	0	The plastic Eastman frying oil funnel and filter work poorly. At oil temperatures high enough to allow the filter to work, the funnel plastic deforms. Not recommended.
A1ET9ZCY9RDPS0	1	1	This was my first Leonard novel. It was called, at the time, "Ryan's rules" (For Success in Armed Robbery). What fun it was to read. Too bad, I gave it away, though I would love to read it again. It is a MUST for any Elmore Leonard fan.
A1ET9ZCY9RDPS0	1	1	I did not read all of the reviews of this book, so this may have been mentioned already. This is a story about a schizophrenic father and the son who loves him and tries to understand him. Nowhere in the book is this disease mentioned, but that diagnosis makes Allie's behavior much easier to explain. The book is a great read.
A1ETGPNHYZ5LXC	1	1	Installation took a total of 3 minutes max, did not even need the installation CD, Vista SP1 recognized the device and took care of the rest. I don't think I have ever had it so easy with anything "network" before!
A1ETGPNHYZ5LXC	0	1	While the rubber grip is nicely made, if falls a little short. I didn't feel that it was a good scrub brush, it did not feel right or lather well. To make matters worse the bottle leaked...
A1ETGPNHYZ5LXC	0	0	Wow, where do I begin with this one? The thread is made of plastic and it broke off in my tripod mount! I was lucky that it was not screwed in tight and could coax it out with a tiny screwdriver. The light produced by the LED's is in the blue range, and blinding to anything looking in the cameras general direction. If that was not bad enough, the pictures come out overexposed and dead looking. Do not recommend!
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	The four titles in this set are (drum roll please):At the MoviesGenltlemen Prefer French &amp; SaundersLiving in a Material WorldThe Ingenue YearsPretty good overall.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	Much to my disappointment several of the advertised tracks were missing. Instead of "Once An Organe, Always Orange," the disc I received had the more familiar "Once an Orange, Always an Orange." Also missing were such heretofore unheard of tracks as "Past World War Two Blues" and "Nat the One." Despite Amazon's eccentric spelling, with the addition of the bonus track "Swallow Wind," the songs on this set are just as they appear on the albums. (Edited to note that Amazon has since corrected its spelling.)Disc one contains the complete "Orange" and "Past, Present & Future" LPs. Disc two starts with the "Swallow Wind" bonus track and then moves on to the complete "Modern Times" album. The only thing that you don't get with this set that you would get if you bought the CDs individually are two bonus tracks from the BGO release of Modern times--the single version of "News From Spain" and "Elvaston Place," which was the B side of "News from Spain." Since the album version of "News Form Spain is included on "Orange," you only give up one song by buying this set rather than the individual CDs, and that song isn't one that anyone is likely to miss.The set comes nicely packaged with a booklet that contains the lyrics to all the songs, plus an essay about the three albums. I did not notice any difference in sound quality between this release and the other CD versions that I have heard. That may be because there is no difference, or it could just be me.The three albums in this set represent a transitional between Al Stewart's early albums (collected in the set "To Whom It May Concern") with their folk-rock relationship angst and his more pop-oriented 70s hits "Year of the Cat" and "Time Passages." The albums included in this set are "Orange" (1972), "Past, Present & Future" (1973), and "Modern Times" (1975).A lot of people think "Orange" is a great album. I am not among them. Fans of Stewart's early work would certainly like it.A lot of people also think "Past, Present & Future" is a great album. I would have to agree, and it is the one that earns this set most of its stars. It is definitely among Stewart's best work."Modern Times" is a bit of a let down from "Past, Present & Future," but still a very good album with some very good songs. This was the first of three Al Stewart albums produced by Alan Parsons--the others being "Year of the Cat" and "Time Passages." It's not as good as the albums that would follow, but still a very respectable effort.(...)
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	I never heard of Firefly until I saw it on an Amazon recommendation. Then awhile later, I read some reviews of Farscape (another show that I'd never seen or heard of). Then I got tem confused and ordered Firefly. I was not disappointed.I've watched 12 of the 14 episodes, and I can confidently say that if this show were currently in production, I'd make a point to watch it. The writing, casting, and acting are all top-notch. Despite what you might think, the Western theme works well. It's certainly one of the more original things to appear on TV, and if you liked Babylon 5 and/or Deep Space 9, you should like this. And if you didn't like them, you still ought to give it a look.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	Like the title says, it's the best of the Britcoms. The cast is great, the writing is great, and the whole thing is utterly charming.There's not a whole lot more to say, except, in response to one of the previous reviewers questions, that it's going to contain all those episodes that didn't make it to VHS. The three seasons on these DVDs each had seven episodes. At about 28 minutes each, that's 588 minutes, which doesn't even come close to the 640 minute runtime advertised for this set.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	0	0	I bought this turntable and got a couple years use out of it, and while it worked, it worked. If you're buying something to use once in a blue moon, this one might do. But if you actually play your records, sooner or later, you'll need to replace the stylus. Or the cartridge. Either way, if you buy this one, you're out of luck. The diamond fell of the stylus on mine, and there doesn't seem to be anything that's replaceable. There's no removable cartridge like you'd find on any decent quality turntable manufactured in the 1980s. Now there doesn't seem to be anything to do with mine other than throw it in the trash. It wasn't terribly expensive--the whole turntable can be had for not a whole lot more than a good quality cartridge--so it's disposability isn't that big a deal from a strictly economic standpoint. But darn it, it just rubs me the wrong way. I'd rather pay a bit more to have something that I can still use ten years down the line than to save a few bucks on something that's going to end up in a landfill in a couple years.

A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	0	1	It didn't work. I plugged the cable in, and... nothing. I tried different HDMI input, and still nothing. I finally found that I could sometimes make it work if I fiddled with it a bit while the DVD player was running, but if I turned the DVD player off and restarted it, the cable would go back to not working.I tried a different cable to make sure this cable was the problem rather than the inputs on the TV and DVD players, and everything worked fine. This cable was definitely the problem.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	I ordered two of these. One of them had the four red Xs on the strip that's supposed to indicate water damage or overheating or something, The other one didn't. My old battery had worn out, and it wouldn't last five minutes. Both of these have worked fine. I've been using the phone this evening with a bluetooth headset for well over three hours, and it says I still have 75% of the battery power left. And that's the one with the red Xs.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	1	1	I was talking with Al after a show a few years back, and I said I thought "Between the Wars" was his best album. He said he thought I was right. Of course, he might have just been feeling agreeable that evening, or maybe he was tired of playing "Year of the Cat," but if it's not his best, it's close.
A1ETIK7N9ZWZY9	0	1	I don't know what it is about this movie that makes it so ineffably aweful, but it is. There are some moview that are just mean-spirited, but honest about it. The original "Texas Chanisaw Massacre" and the original "The Hitcher" come to mind as movies that were just hard to watch. Juno was different. When I was watching it, it seemed okay--certainly not a good movie, but occasionally amusing. But the next day, and the day it would invade my thoughts and I'd be overcome with the same sort of soul-sucking depression that I felt when watching the Texas Chanisaw Massacre. And it's not because of any "mesasage" the movie might have had about abortion or anything like that; it's the phoniness of the characters, the obnoxious self-conscious quirkiness, the God-awful dialog, the yellow shorts. It's insideously corrosive, like hydrofluoric acid for the soul. It's no mere conicidence that the author of this abomination calls hereself "Diablo."
A1ETL3WBQOM4XL	0	1	If this was a comedy cd I would give it 5 stars.I guess it's how you look at it.I found this cd in a pawn shop.I guess that should have been hint enough not to buy it.Anyway I looked at the cd and was thinking &quot;It's the girls from Prince and the Revolution its got to be good.&quot; Well I didn't have my cd player with me so I decided to read the lyrics.The lyrics sounded like they were written by a 5 yr old.When I found out that they wrote the lyrics I was taken off guard.When I got home my sister read the lyrics and said that the lyrics sounded corny.My sister and I were dying to put the cd in the cd player.We both knew how bad it would sound.Honeymoon Express was not bad,but it wasn't hit material.White was the best song on the cd,probably because it was instrumental.I noticed that Wendy and Lisa are not great singers but they are great instrumentalists.They should make only instrumental cd's.What were they thinking when they wrote The Side Show,because when I think of a side show I think of something grotesque.I know that was not their intent.Bottom line, they are great instrumentalists but not great writers or singers.I hear Eroica sounds really good.I'm going to check that one out.I'm kind of leery about listening to Fruit at the Bottom.But anyway I wish them the best in whatever they do.
A1ETL3WBQOM4XL	0	0	Just with all of Hart's books this book cover is misleading.You look at the cover and think I'm really going to learn something and you read the book and get disappointed.He only shows the finnished step.He doesn't show the steps on how to get to the finnished step.Instead of describing how he draws it he gives you a history on each car.I'm sorry but telling a person the car history doesn't show them how to draw the car.I'm starting to think that Hart's books aren't very good.
A1ETL3WBQOM4XL	1	0	Funny I'm not into slow songs but man those slow songs were catchy!That's why I gave her 4 stars.I didn't give her five because she didn't have to use the f word in &quot;Love Scene(OOh Baby).Before purchasing this cd I kept hearing how foul the lyrics were.I don't think they were that bad just very sensual.Yes I know she curses in &quot;Son of a Gun&quot;.Anyway I enjoyed the beginning of &quot;Trust A Try&quot; it sounded like she was singing fast opera.Then it turned into something funky (funky in a good way).My favorite song on the cd was &quot;Feel So Right&quot;.I could listen to that song over and over again.Funny I didn't get the cd for it's popular radio songs like &quot;All for you&quot; and &quot;Someone to call my lover&quot; but the slow songs.This is because you hear the songs to death on the radio you don't want to buy the cd.I encourage anybody to listen to any cd before you buy like at cdnow.com Janet if your reading this your still on top of the rest!!!!

A1ETL3WBQOM4XL	0	1	I'm not going to put anyone down for using a grid because the Old Masters used to use it,but I personally think the grid doesn't work.You still have to know how to draw in the square.If you look at the picture of the little girl with the graph over her you will see her eyes are perfect circles.A graph is not going to help you draw perfect circles,you'll have to use a circle template for that.She made it seem like drawing a line drawing from a photograph was easy.When you draw from a cartoon you just draw the lines you see.In a photograph you can't see the lines because they don't exist in real life.She doesn't show you how to create lines from a photograph.This is something a graph will not show you.As for her blending method,you really don't need to know all those fancy names like cast shadow for instance.When you look at a black and white picture I doubt it if you could determine where all the different names of light are.All you need to know is that if you see a certain shade, color in the same shade in your drawing.How you do that I have no idea.I'm still looking for a book to explain that to me.Her book has astonishing before and after drawings.This makes me wonder if they really used her teaching to draw better...

A1ETQN0GCYJX8K	1	0	Disturbing. Sad. Painful. Sickening. Heartbreaking. Hopeful.This was hands-down the most painful book I think I've ever read. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't actually based upon the life of any one person. Personally, however, I found the descriptions of abuse and betrayal to be so graphic, that I can't help but wonder whether the author had someone's life story in mind when she took pencil to paper and wrote this book.This book was difficult for me on so many levels. First, I had difficulty with the coarse language and graphic descriptions of a child molested practically from birth. At one point, I almost put it down; yet as soon as I did, I couldn't stop thinking about the main character. I wanted to know more about her. And so I was compelled to pick it back up and keep reading. I think it would be untrue to say that I'm glad I picked it back up, yet how could I NOT finish it?This book produced the most amazing range of emotions from me. My heart ached for Precious, and I was downright furious at her parents. I was sickened and nauseated by the abuse she endured from her parents; the two people in the world who should've loved and protected her. They violated her in every way imaginable...physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally.Truly an unforgettable book. A book that calls to me and makes me want to change the world and make it a better and safer place for people like Precious. A book that inspires me to want to seek punishment for those who use and abuse the very people they are entrusted to protect.This book is not for the sensitive or for the faint-hearted. It's one I will never forget.
A1ETQN0GCYJX8K	1	1	I think I've found a new favorite author. This is the second book by Cathy Lamb I've read, and I can't decide which one I like better. She's such a fantastic author and her books really grab ahold of me.What is so appealing about this book? Pretty much everything. You have Julia, a young woman who escapes an abusive relationship on her wedding day and moves in with her eccentric Aunt Lydia, who unapologetically hosts women's sexuality "meetings" at her home and grows pot in the basement. Then you have the peripheral characters who become so important in Julia's life - and are each so eccentric in their own ways - that you wish you could be part of their friendship circle.I truly loved this book. I loved the range of emotions that it pulled from me....Laughter and tears, and sometimes laughter through tears. I can't wait to decide which of the Cathy Lamb books to read next!
A1ETQN0GCYJX8K	1	1	I'm not a fan of home births, so I really didn't expect to love this book or to find any sympathy for the characters in the story. I'm not saying women shouldn't be allowed to have home births, or that they must have a board-certified doctor present during labor; I'm simply saying it's an option I would never have entertained for even a second. With those thoughts in mind, I picked this book up with low expectations and never expected to find the least bit of empathy for the main character. Boy was I surprised!Regardless of one's personal feelings on home births and lay midwives, it would be very difficult to read this book and not be lured into a strong feeling of empathy for the main characters in this book. I found myself turning the pages, almost against my will. I found myself siding with the midwife and hoping that the legal proceedings would find her innocent and set her free to continue her life's calling.I expected a lot of things from this book - mostly negative. What I didn't expect was to truly love it, or to find myself having to pick up my jaw off the floor as I turned the last page. Excellent read!
A1ETQN0GCYJX8K	0	1	I should preface this by saying that I absolutely love historical fiction, and - for that genre - Philippa Gregory is my favorite author....WHEN that historical fiction is based on actual historical figures or events. Gregory does a beautiful job of opening the reader's mind to the what-ifs of the history lesson that you didn't learn in high school or college, and for that reason she's a fantastic author of historical fiction.Unless the characters are entirely a product of her imagination and not at all based on historical people or events. And then you might as well skip it.Such is the case with "The Wise Woman." This book was a complete waste of time. I read another reviewer compare it to a Stephen King novel, and I really think that reviewer hit the nail right on the head. If you enjoy Stephen King and you're not looking for historical fiction, you might like this book. If not, skip it entirely and look toward her much better books like "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Constant Princess."Bizarre, unrealistic, demonic and creepy are the only adjectives I can come up with to describe this book. I will certainly be more discerning in my future Philippa Gregory selections, as this isn't the first time I've been burned. I could say the same about the "Wideacre" series which was like watching a train wreck. You know you should look away, but you just can't help yourself and so you keep reading, only to wish you'd looked away when you had the chance.

These are prerequisites to effective study of the word of God. I own various translations of the bible, however, the NASB is by far my favorite due to it's accuracy. The Strong's Exhaustive Concordance, is a great tool to assist one in discovering the original meaning of biblical words, and locating scripture verses. Studying the bible is like mining, and a Strong's Exhaustive Concordance is just one of the tools needed to aid you in finding the gold.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	David Hanson provides great historical anecdotes throughout this book. Writing in a fresh and compelling way, he takes on the assertions promoted by elite academics that all cultures are morally equal. The claim that there are no values, which are better or worse for a society to adopt, is directly addressed in this book. Hanson provides a much needed and refreshing voice in the marketplace of ideas.He does a remarkable job of taking on the `blame America first crowd'. For instance, on numerous occasions I've heard the question, "Why do they hate America so much?" This question is often coupled with an underlying belief that the democratic and free world bares blame for being the target of terrorism. However, this seems to be much like accusing a female victim of assault of wearing clothes that are too attractive. Do innocent people deserve to die because they live in a country that is too free, too capitalistic, and too democratic?Yes, Hanson's writing is opinionated, but I'd prefer reading a book where the author is assertive and clear on the ideas being expressed. Unfortunately, most of what is written on the events of 9/11 is descriptive, but lacks any prescription. Hanson does both.In short, Hanson shows how an adequate and right response to terrorism can and will leave the world a better place. His historical examples and clear thinking result in an important book on a difficult topic.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	First of all, the biographical anecdotes that Bronson presents are great. They are pictures of interesting people who struggle with real issues. These stories are entertaining and well written. With that said, I was disappointed with the suggestions (or lack there of) found in the rest of the book.Bronson writes that, "We all have passions if we choose to see them,". This is certainly true. However, it would seem a book with this title would provide a means by which a person can differentiate their passions. What I mean is, it's impossible to follow all of our passion, and neither doest it seem that we `should' follow all of our passions. I know it would be a major mistake for me to follow some of my passions. So, how can a person know which passions to follow? I wish Bronson had spent some time on this instead of merely pointing out that passions exist in all of us - by this he almost takes an `it's all good' attitude.Bronson writes about `callings', but doesn't explore where these callings come from. Additionally, he strangely writes about self-acceptance. He doesn't seem to acknowledge that there are some things about ourselves that we should accept and others that we shouldn't. This would be essential in a book like this. Furthermore, he refers to moral guilt as always being negative. He misses the fact that moral guilt is sometimes very good and inhibits us from doing what we should not do.Lastly this book comes across as promoting an essentially self-centered life. You find your dream, and then you go get it for you so that you will be happy. This approach short sells the importance of others, and doing things for other people. That is, altruism can be an incredible source of peace and satisfaction. However, Bronson feeds the "me-first" message that is so strong in our culture today.In short, this book deals with a very important and much needed subject. Unfortunately, the conclusions presented here leave much to be desired. If you want to read his 'bottom line' check out page 362 - the first full paragraph.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	0	Mel Levine's first book `A Mind at a Time' succeeded in taking a common sense approach to the important subject of learning types. This book does the same thing, but focuses on one specific functional challenge - that of a lack of productivity.1. Levine continues to assert that different learning styles require different teaching strategies. As a result, he does not believe that any child is inherently lazy. While this is likely true for young children, it does not seem to be necessarily the case for adolescents or adults. (Levine would disagree) That is, laziness can be learned and even chosen later in life. In fact, I often find myself choosing the way of the sloth - to my own frustration and embarrassment.2. Levine identifies a number of causes of low performance. Some of these are internal like organizational problems, poor ability to verbally express, or poor writing skills. However, these types of things don't seem to be `causes' as much as they do `results' or `symptoms'. He does go on to briefly discuss external factors like socioeconomic background, family life, and negative role models. Now these seem to be more root-causes - however, he doesn't spend much time on these, which I found to be disappointing.3. The thing that I do like about Levine is that he develops suggestions for what parents can do to encourage productive output in children. Additionally, he provides objective means for identifying if the problem is internal or environmental. I happen to believe the vast majority of people fall into the latter category - at least as the initial influence. However, it seems laziness becomes a choice as well. So, there's a bit of controversy here - which makes the book interesting and relevant.4. Lastly, Levine doesn't leave the reader in an ethereal and contemplative world, but brings problem solving down to a real-life level by providing worksheets, which assist children in planning stories and reports - to get their minds working.5. It seems it's so necessary to start fostering creativity, activity, and expression at a young age. Additionally, abundant parental praise related to accomplishments is also very needed. In short, this is a good book, however it would have been helpful if Levine had focused more in the area of relationships.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	How does a person overcome destructive emotions? This is the real and important question this book attempts to discuss on a religous, scientific, and philosophical basis. Goleman's account is surprisingly easy to read, and likewise the concepts are readily understandable. However, I was ultimately disappointed in the book. Here is why...Regarding destructive emotions, there is very little in the book, which refers to 'root causes' of those emotions. Rather there is an emphasis on controlling emotions. This approach attempts to deal with symptoms via practices intended to annihilate desire/craving (the dharma practice) The apparent contradiction is this -- parental love, pleasure seeking, and self-defense are all part of our emotional make up. Therefore, some emotions are good and some are bad. (few would disagree with this.) However, the dharma practice is a means of decreasing emotional desire in its entirety.If a distinction is to be made between the 'good' emotions and the 'bad' emotions then a value judgment is required. So, the question which never gets answered in the book is 'Within the Buddhist tradition what is the framework for making moral distinctions?' Ok, with that said, the most interesting part of the book is when Owen Flanagan (Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Human Interaction Laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School) discusses the differences between virtue ethics, utilitarian ethics, and Kantian ethics - in an attempt to show that some sort of value judgment needs to be made between emotions. (pages 63-68) Unfortunately, much of his discussion is never adequately responded to by anyone in attendance, including the Dalai Lama.The other key point, which never gets answered, is regarding the Buddhist term, which roughly translates, 'destructive emotions'. The term is, 'Klesha' also translated 'mental affliction'. Now, this is where it gets interesting. Is this 'mental affliction' a cause or a result? Does anxiety arise out of negative behavior or does anxiety cause negative behavior. If it is negative behavior that causes destructive emotions then instead of simply ignoring those emotions it seems best for a person to change the behavior that's causing the emotions. Unfortunately, this common sense answer isn't offered in the book.In short, a number of good and challenging points were asked of the Dalai Lama, but his answers to these questions were weak and somewhat evasive. Instead of pressing for a more adequate answer, those in attendance would simply go on to the next point. Part of a good dialog is asking honest questions and waiting for an honest answer. While there are good questions in the book, I didn't find satisfying answers to those questions. In fact, it doesn't seem that many of the points can be addressed w/in the Buddhist framework. That's disappointing.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	1. This book certainly addresses an important issue, but the approach Arrianna Huffington takes pushes the edges of over-statement and exaggeration. This may make for humorous writing as she takes shots at capitalism, but it truly undermines her credibility. I had to translate her statements because they were often heavy-handed and rarely polite. She seemed to be trying to achieve an emotional response from her readers rather than an intellectual one. It's a WWF response that avoids subtlety.2. Huffington's tactics remind me of the outraged man-hater who shouts, "All men are pigs!" However, in this book she shouts, "All corporate type are money grubbing, greedy swine!". This broad-brushed approach makes for tedious reading. Yes, she did a boat-load of research for the book, and I appreciate that, but it doesn't offset the acid-spitting outrage that she displays. She's angry. Ok, there's nothing wrong with being angry and I will admit that corporate scandal is something worthy of being angry over. However, at times I wanted to ask her to "calm down...count to ten...take a deep breath.... Relax, OK, now tell me what's wrong AND more importantly, how we should fix it."3. This leads to my next point... because Huffington complains throughout the book, there is little space devoted to constructive suggestions. That is, she offers virtually no solutions. The only thing she mentions which could be interpreted as a solution is her request that more people participate in democracy - that is, more people need to get out and vote. That's all she really offers in the book from a positive standpoint. She doesn't suggest what laws would be good to pass, or what laws would be good to get rid of, or how strong moral laws are to be created.4. Now, regarding capitalism as a whole, it would have been helpful if she spent a chapter explaining the positives and negatives of "free markets" compared to markets that are government owned and government funded. This would have provided some serious credibility and more of a scholarly approach.All of this analysis goes to say that I was sorely disappointed in the book.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	First of all, I'd like to say how easy this book is to read. With all of the dialog it flows well, and reads almost like fiction. Weiss is certainly a polished writer and does a good job at adding interesting details. However, with that said, I was disappointed with the book. Here is why...I do not question Dr. Weiss or Catherine's experience. I don't think she was making any of it up. What I do take exception with is Weiss's interpretation of the accounts. He believes that Catherine was not only recounting past lives, but that she was being spoken to by `spirit masters'. Instead of building a strong case for why he believes this to be true, he seems to just accept is as a brute fact and does not question his interpretation. Even if he is correct, his conclusion (that we should believe their messages) doesn't necessarily follow.Weiss claims that the messages are coming from highly evolved spirit entities. While the book portrays them as being intelligent, this does not mean their messages are true. I know plenty of intelligent people who I would never trust and whose messages would be dangerous to follow. The world we live in contains both good and evil people. How do we know for certain that this is not the case for the spirit world? I mean, is it possible that the spirit masters are not telling the truth?Here's the thing that concerns me. Catherine was experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, and fears prior to meeting with Weiss. Were these emotional states caused by the spirit masters? Where they `haunting' her and tormenting her? If so, why should they be trusted?Weiss said that he believed the messages by way of `intuition' and he goes on to stat the he `just knew it in his bones'. Then he closes the final chapter by saying that he thinks the spirit masters are still influencing his intuition. So, the spirit masters influenced his intuition, but he knew they were right by way of his intuition? This is a case of pure circular reasoning.Amazingly the spirit masters promote classic new age teaching - we are not to judge others, we are beyond space and time, we can become god-like, we will gradual merge with God... etc. I wonder if Weiss had been an orthodox Jew if the masters would have declared classic Jewish doctrine?
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	Pagals' writing makes for a well-researched and scholarly book. However, I believe her conclusions to be careless, in that they are simply not fair to the original documents.1. She points out, correctly, that Christianity did have great initial diversity - as compared to other religions, which often consisted of a single social or racial group. In contrast, Christianity embraced women, slaves, Jews, Gentiles, Greeks, Romans, tax collectors, fisherman, etc. The point she doesn't make is that this continues today. The core tenants of Christianity are embracing of all people - although not of all ideas. I wish she would have made this important distinction.2. The other historical observation she makes is that Christianity narrowed to include only certain scriptural texts as authoritative. This is accurate. (Although her assumption is that a large amount of Christians embraced other 'Gnostic' texts - a claim boasting little evidence.) The council of Nicea certainly did this. If a canon was never arrived at some point, then which writings would be seen as authoritative and which would not? If boundaries were never set, then I suppose a person may argue today that the Koran should be seen as a Christian text? (In fact, that might be the next hot-seller!)3. The substance of her book consists of a conflict she sets up between the books of John and Thomas. She claims that Thomas offered readers a message of 'spiritual enlightenment', instead of promoting Jesus as an exclusive means to God, and the only 'light of the world'. I'm still not sure why she sees Thomas as a message of 'spiritual enlightenment', and apparently not John. (Maybe the individual becomes their own savior instead of needing to turn to Christ?) Furthermore, I don't understand her lament that 'only one was chosen'. She wants them both to be authoritative, and yet they contradict each other regarding truth-claims? Perhaps in Pagals' world truth doesn't seem to pose a problem. However, in the realm of logic, if two statements contradict each other, then only one can be true. The early Christians believed truth existed, and were therefore forced abandon the book of Thomas since it not only doesn't fit with John, but it contradicts much of the rest of the NT - particularly many of Jesus' statements about Himself.4. Pagals points out that the book of Thomas teaches individuals that "there is a light within each person, and it lights up the whole universe. If it does not shine, there is darkness." This is an incredible contrast to John's teaching that Jesus is the light of the world and that His followers reflect Jesus' light - He is the source.5. Pagels suggests that Thomas be 'recovered' as a way of embracing the 'glorious diversity of religious tradition'? The first type of diversity mentioned earlier in the book is one of Christianity embracing numerous racial, social, and economic backgrounds. However, what she promotes now is a very different form of 'diversity'. Pagals now suggests contradictory truth-claims be accepted in the name of 'diversity'. In short, she suggests the book of Thomas be promoted at the expense of truth. This is a very bold claim. In fact, it's so bold that I wonder why she doesn't go further and suggest all Gnostic teachings be seen as canonical. In fact, what would make her stop there? Here's the thing, Pagals doesn't want to reform Christianity, she wants it to become Gnostic.6. She claims religion is not an assent to a set of beliefs, but a fabric of teachings that connect us with 'the divine'. If that's her belief, then is that a belief she wants her readers to believe in contradiction to the NT? Is she promoting this belief despite the exclusive claims of Christ that He is the Way, Truth, and Life?7. Reformation is a calling back to original beliefs. Pagals tries so desperately to claim that she is reforming Christianity back to its core tenants - or at least to something 'better'. However, this is a significant stretch and she fails leap over the gap. Gnostic beliefs existed independently of Christianity; and still do. Christianity never was Gnostic. The two are oil and water. Her book is a valiant and 'scholarly' effort, but it falls significantly short. Again, it's the peskiness of truth that proves Pagals' principal foe.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	"A New Kind of Christian" is primarily about the importance of change within the church in order to make the church more relevant to a post-modern world. When reading the book I often thought of the adage, "In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity." And then questions would come to mind: What are the distinctions between essentials and non-essentials? Are there some essentials in Christianity, which would be disastrous to change? When is dogma a virtue? These are foundational questions, which I wish McLaren had at least attempted to answer. Not all change is good, and he seems to miss this self-evident point. It would have substantially bettered the book had he provided some qualifiers that would assist in determining change resulting in progression vs. change resulting in regression.--One of the primary things that concerns me with this book is how little value is placed on truth from a theological perspective. Repeatedly McLaren downplays the importance of theology and the intellectual Christian life. He claims the `wars' between liberals and conservatives are `over', and that Christians need to stop defending those fronts. However, this would be to abandon essential issues such as ........what constitutes salvation, the nature of God, biblical inerrancy, and biblical compatibility with science. These continue to be very real issues, and the debate is now more relevant than ever. To give up now would be tragic. The liberals and conservatives tackle these issues by asking the simple question `Are the claims true?' and `Is the Bible accurate?' Now `A New Kind of Christian' comes out and declares, "It doesn't matter if they're true or not, it's irrelevant, we need to progress and change - let's move on, and leave all of this behind." Do you see how subtle and dangerous this approach is?--McLaren degrades those who believe in absolute truth, and suggests those who believe `knowledge is power' are wrong. He has a pragmatic view of truth, declaring something is true if it `works'. However, he then fails to define how someone can know if something `works' or not. He makes very general statements about changing things in the church until they `work'. What does that mean? .... Until more people show up?.... Until people `feel' they `like' church `more'? His meaning is very vague.--Here's the inconstant part, the author periodically quotes passages from the Nicene Creed, or from Paul's words to Timothy, or from the Gospels. However, he doesn't present these words as being `true' or not because he doesn't see the value in defending their truthfulness. He simply presents them as words that have `helped' him or that he thinks are `beautiful phrases' or that he `agrees with'. This is a very slippery view because it is a position that must equally value all things that all people find useful and beautiful. Scripture is no longer exclusive, truth is no longer absolute, Christianity is no longer the only way. There is value in all religions, and all wise writings, the scope of religion transcends all human experience. Do you see how we carefully walks away from Christianity into general `Spirituality'?--Unfortunately, this book is more dangerous that the writings of someone like John Shelby Spong because it is so much more covert and subtle. Evangelicals are reading this book, and I'm guessing some of them have a difficult time discerning where the author departs from orthodox Christianity. If you read this book, I would suggest you test every word and phrase as you read it with a critical eye - seek do divide truth from error, right from wrong, light from darkness, and the good from the bad.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	Eldridge suggests there is 'glory' hidden in each Christian's heart, and the goal is to capture and maintain a sense of liberation through a realization of human glory.As in his other books, John Eldridge conveys some great stories. Here he relates emotionally engaging accounts from The Perfect Storm, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz. However, the other parts of the book (theology and conclusions) have prompted me to rate this book at only two stars. Let me tell you why.Eldridge's book ultimately focuses on the realization of human glory. I suggest this stands in stark contrast to the New Testament. However, before I critique his conclusion, let me first convey his approach.Here is a summary of the book:1. God wants us to be happy. (Starting and presumed premise)2. However, we are not always happy. (Provides real-life examples)3. Therefore, we are either blowing it or God is. (Eldridge's words)4. The fault cannot be God's therefore it must be ours. (Assumed conclusion)5. God's glory is 'man fully alive'. (Read 'fully alive' as 'fully happy')6. 'God's happiness and my happiness are tied together'. (A direct quote from the book)7. Therefore, 'God's committed to my happiness'. (Another quote)8. In fact, 'my happiness is the purpose of Christianity'. (An abbreviated quote)9. Final conclusion: I need to live for my happines.(Summary)I'm not pulling your leg. This is directly from the first chapter! I found this first chapter to be the substance of the book with the rest of the book becoming footnotes to this primary chapter.Ok, the outline above stands in direct contrast to the words of Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, James, and ultimately - God the Father.Here's a summary of the New Testament:1. God wants us to be holy (Matt. 5:48)2. Because of this God is far more concerned with our character than He is with our comfort/happiness. (Romans 5:3-5!)3. This is because our happiness is fleeting and our character remains for eternity. (James 4:14)4. We will have trials, troubles, and tribulation in this world. (Acts 5:41)5. Take heart, for God has over-come the world through Jesus. (John 16:33)6. Jesus will be your source of strength and peace through this difficult life. (John 15)7. Live for Him. He is the source of real joy despite life-circumstances. (Luke 9:23&24)As a result, I'm disappointed in the book - not because I didn't 'like' it, but because I'm convinced it misrepresents scripture - including Jesus' person and work. Far from waking the dead, I believe this book ends up misleading the living.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	King leads an interesting discussion on 'The Gospel of Mary of Magdala' as she attempts a scholarly study on this controversial Gnostic text.King claims this writing is an 'early Christian gospel', but on further examination the claims of this late text contrast sharply with the claims of Jesus in the synoptic texts. As other reviewers noted the claims of this text lead to a radical reinterpretation of Jesus' teaching. For instance, the 'Gospel of Mary' rejects Christ's suffering and death as the path to eternal life. This is the key, central, and foundational teaching of the Christian gospel. Jesus being the 'Lamb who takes away the sins of the world' is the essence of the gospel. To deny this is to purport something different that Christianity and in the case of the 'Gospel of Mary' it was an attempt to usurp Christianity with Gnosticism. I wish King had pointed this out.King argues that this Gnostic gospel of Mary prefers 'inner spiritual knowledge' as oppose to the claims of Jesus - His claims that he is the way, truth, life, and light. As a result, this other gospel contradicts Jesus' teachings about himself as it separates truth from his very person. In fact, the text King examines claims that Mary alone was imparted esoteric teachings. This is, of course, Gnostic teaching, which claims elite 'special knowledge' or 'secret teachings'. However, this is far different from what is found in the synoptic gospels where Jesus' teaching is always about himself with no secret knowledge outside of his person. King doesn't seem to make this point.After evaluating King's book I wonder why it was that Gnosticism dried up and blew away while Christianity thrived. I have to believe it has to do with Jesus being the 'good news' for common people, common sinners, common weary men and women. This appeals to people far more than a 'secret society'. People want a person to know, a person who loves them, and a person who forgives them. Jesus offered that in the first century and still does today.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	Stern's definition of &quot;religious terrorism&quot; is comprehensive, encompassing the growing Muslim jihad in Indonesia, militant Palestinians and zealous Israelis, and Americans who kill abortion doctors in the name of Christ. The thing she didn't expound upon is if any of those terrorist groups are radically and consistently living out the core tenants of their belief-system or if they are being disingenuous to their faith. This would have gone a long ways in helping the reader understand differing terrorist motives and possible manipulation of their respective religions. That is, are some people using their faith for their own personal ends as opposed to submitting to its truth-claims?Certainly the author has done an enormous amount of first-hand research. However, after interviewing extremist members of three religions around the world: Christians, Jews, and Muslims, Jessica Stern implies that each of these world religions is equally conducive to terrorism. However, common sense, statistical analysis, and history prove otherwise. Is that politically correct to say? No, however, I wish she'd had the courage to acknowledge that basic truth.Explaining the &quot;how&quot; therefore becomes as important as explaining the &quot;why,&quot; and the book carefully outlines the ways in which militant leaders of all denominations find recruits among the disenfranchised. It's the phrase `all denominations' that hints at Stern's wide blanket toss. Is she suggesting everyone's the same and all beliefs are equally at fault? It appears so. And if so, that's academically irresponsible and simply doesn't fit the facts.Stern suggests the most effective counterstrategy to terrorism is thus not violence but nonviolent techniques such as psychological counter-warfare and the reaffirmation of our own values. However, it's that last part that raises questions. We are to reaffirm our own values? Wait, I thought earlier she suggest that `all denominations' are to be blamed for the rise in terrorism. How is it that we should re-affirm our own beliefs? If she were to be logically consistent is seems she should suggest all metaphysical beliefs be abandoned.Stern compares Muslim suicide bombers with early Christian martyrs. The obvious thing she doesn't point out is the Christian martyrs were put to death (murdered) for their faith - while suicide bombers put others to death (murder) for their faith. It seems she would have been best served sticking with the comparison between abortion clinic bombers and suicide bombers.Some of Stern's research is at best questionable. On page 26 she quotes a person who's suppose to be an authority on Christianity and in one paragraph the person makes three significant mistakes. I'll conclude with this statement from page 95. "Evangelical Christians and Messianic Jews have developed a cooperative relationship, based on their common belief that rebuilding the Temple will facilitate the process of redemption..." At best this statement is sloppy and at worst it's intentionally misleading. The vast majority of both Evangelical Christians and Messianic Jews do not believe this. Yes, there is a small faction, which is more accurately defined as dispensational Christianity who might believe this - but this would represent a very small number of people.In short, I'm disappointed with the lack of distinctions in the book - and expect more from an author of her experience and influence.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	First of all, I appreciate Dr. Wayne's gentle approach both in speaking and in writing. He's a pursuasive man who displays great communication skills. With that said, I had some questions and concerns about this book. Let me explain.The Power of Intention is a semi-religious presentation that urges readers to connect with the 'source', which Dyer occasionally names 'god'. I found he describes this `source' to be the connecting link attaching every material thing to 'intent'. Ok, that may seem a little ethereal, but that's where he takes this.Dyer writes much about divine love and intent. As a result, my question becomes this... If `love' exists who is the Lover? If `intent' exists who is the Intender? See, The god Dyer sets up is a nebulous `source' divorced from personhood. Why do I say that? Because he claims you are as much god as God is. If god is all and is in all, then how could an impersonal energy force be capable of such a thing as `love'? I wish Dyer had addressed this.If a personal, creator God does exist Dyer presents an informal religion, which ends up curiously leaving Him out. Or, at a minimum Dyer espouses a belief-system limiting and reducing God to a much more manageable deity. There are no moral requirements with Dyer's god, and certainly there's no need to worship such a deity - or to seek that deity's will.I don't mean to sound harsh, but Dyer's god is the individual. Your will is god's will. Your desires are god's desires. It's the same new age belief that you are god, and that you need to recognize that. Which is really no god at all. If a creator God exists then Dyer's god tries to unemploy Him.Dyer quotes Jung, 'One of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.' I was thinking about this statement and how, if a personal/creator God does exist, and if that God is all-powerful and `totally pure' (and we are not) then we indeed would need something to protect us from God. Attempting direct connection with the Creator of the universe via meditative union may not be wise. In fact, it may be foolish. As a result, a mediator may be what we need even more than meditation. The question then becomes, who is the best mediator between God and humanity?
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	In short, this is a sort of self-help manual for the self-advancer. In summary, some actions are presented to gain the individual power while others are seen to decrease it. As a result, megalomaniacs unite! Get the power you desire to get what you want the way you want to get it.Sure, this approach might not do much for your relationships - but if you're a person who prefers desert island victories and cave domination to social functions then this approach may work well.The only real flaw I see in the book is that the oppressor must live with those who are oppressed. Well, I guess that assumes they're allowed to live.The authors write, "Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit," - Some might call that stealing. It's also referred to as plagiarism. In taking their advice, I was thinking about gaining the power of writing this book myself. I guess all I'd need is a Xerox copy of the text and I'll be taking this down to Kinko's for binding!
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	First of all, Bill Gertz is a master at the art of gumshoe reporting. The extent of his research is boggling and I celebrate the totality of his indexing in this book. (I like books with good indexes) His personal interviews combined with hours of digging through mundane documents of bureaucracy have certainly paid off. If any government wanted to both compile and analyze the details Gertz did, how many committees and sub-committees would have had to be assembled?His documentation on China supplying weapons to al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 is no less than maddening. What have those weapons been used for? Were they used by al Qaeda assisted terrorists in Beslan?Russia and France don't come out looking any better in their cooperation with Saddam Hussein after the 2003 Iraq war broke out. Huh, no wonder they were comfortable with the UN status quo.Gertz absolutely shames the UN in their exploitation of the "oil for food" program. Make sure you have a bottle of antacid handy before getting too deep into this - otherwise a person could end up burning a hole through their esophagus.His conclusions were a little simplistic and pretty obvious. He suggests we need 1. good reliable intelligence 2. the ability to execute quickly on that information 3. cooperation from allies.Much of Gertz work suggests international alliances are to be pursued with great care. Or, at a minimum, pursuing trusting relationships with some countries may be downright foolish. Trust takes time to rebuild. It's true in personal relationships. It's true with international ones as well.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	This book claims to be a common-sense approach to success in life. And the author says it goes `Beyond Positive Thinking'. However, let's face it. This is the same stuff you've seen before. Note: this book was first published in 1988 under the title: "The Advanced Formula for Total Success" And it embraces the same positive visualization technique you've tried before. If someone sees something revolutionary in the book I've missed, please post that.One thing the book emphasizes is aligning a person with the universe so that they become naturally attracted towards the things they want. I've never found this to be a problem. I want the things I want. I don't always get the things I want, but I still want them. My desires remain oriented towards what I want.Here's the thing I wish the book included. I was hoping the book allowed the individual to evaluate the things he/she wants. That is, I was waiting for a measure by which to determine what desires to pursue and which to turn away from. There's no distinction made between good and bad emotions, desires, and wants. I'm not suggesting all desires should be suppressed, but I'm suggesting it's important to differentiate between the good and the bad.In short, this book is 80's California-based self help material. You've read it before. Might I suggest something a little more rigorous? Maybe something that's even older and has stood the test of time? Don't settle - look for the best.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	McLaren claims each of the various Christian traditions holds beneficial practices and beliefs. This seems to be a fair-minded and reasonable approach to the subject of Orthodoxy.Doesn't it also seem to follow that while various traditions each hold something worthy of conservation they may also hold to practices, which are not? If so, I was wanting McLaren to distinguishing between the things that fall inside orthodoxy and those that fall outside. This would have been helpful in knowing where freedom should be encouraged and where diversity of beliefs becomes a vice.That is, should individuals hold differing views on the deity of Jesus, etc? McLaren's open-door theology appears to be overly inclusive as it fails to distinguish those core truths, which apply to all peoples in all times and all places.How wide does McLaren cast the net of orthodoxy? Consider page 198 where McLaren claims each of the `sola' phrases from the reformation to be `too narrow'....- 'Sola Scriptura' is too narrow. (The bible alone isn't sufficient as a means of spiritual authority?)- 'Sola Christus' is too narrow. (Jesus Christ alone isn't sufficient for salvation?)- 'Sola gratia' is too narrow. (We need more than God's grace?)- 'Sola Deo Gloria' is too narrow. (There is something other than God's glory we should live for?)The book reveals where McLaren as an individual `feels comfortable'. However, it doesn't convey why some doctrines are true and some are false. How does a person know the difference?If a right knowing of the boundaries of orthodoxy is a requirement to godly living & loving others - then McLaren's book falls short.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	I had mixed feelings about this book. Himmelfarb cannot be discarded as merely an undistinguished poorly reasoned historian (as some critics seem to want to suggest). On the contrary she's a redactionist of importance in the area of historical movements and measures. And this work proves it again.What Himmelfarb tries to do is reclaim the Enlightenment from what she sees as misguided French thinkers. It's difficult not to see her connections between a decline of religion, and the cultural outflowing resulting from aspects of the French Enlightenment.In contrast she presents the British Enlightenment as connected with social affections, based on a more solid moral foundation than that of the French with it's naked "ideology of reason" - a term I wish she would have explained in further detail.With that said, I found her claims regarding the French Enlightenment to be over-simplified. She claims, a preoccupation with reason as the primary fault of the French Enlightenment. However, I don't find this convincing in that the English movement was also very much focused on rationality, logic, and reason. My guess is her reaction here is too strong and too generalized. Furthermore, does she miss the need for societies to be built on the ideal of rigorous intellectualism?On the whole, her work is both sophisticated and easy to get at, and certainly makes credible contributions to this field with her more conservative approach. Any honest evaluator cannot write this book off as a docile and unenthusiastic romanticizing of the events. - rather, it's a worthy read, worthy of evaluation.

The second has brown stripes and he's named 'Zebra'. The third is yellow and appropriately gets named 'Moonlight'. Then, the fourth hatchling is a little peculiar. He breaks out and says, `Guji Guji'. And so the story goes...Of course their mother loves them all and treats them all the same. However, Guji soon learns he's a little different - bigger and stronger. He's got no feathers and no beak or webbed feet. He's even made fun of by the crocodiles who live in the river - who also threaten him and his family. And it's at this point Guji comes up with a plan to save his mother and siblings!It's a book about family loyalty. Guji's a winner.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Have you wondered why so few Christians live a victorious Christian life? Why are so many people in the church defeated and living lives of mediocrity? These are the questions Beth Moore addresses in this book. And she does a great job providing practical and down to earth answers.It's been said that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. And Moore's book addresses the importance of believing God for who He said He is and our need to rest in His grace. God's intention is for believers to be found successful in His provisions through Jesus. It's a reminder we all need and it's a message Moore is uniquely equipped to deliver.Of course so much of Moore's charm is conveyed through here verbal teaching. However, her enthusiasm still comes through loud and clear in this book. If you're looking for the life given to those who are more than conquerors, allow this book to point you to God's supply.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Bloom has proven himself a master of the intellectual life. His passion for learning and knowledge is contagious and it's that steady enthusiasm which makes this book pleasurable.Bloom starts out working from the premise that literature can inform our lives. Certainly this is well established and few would challenge him. It's working from this assertion that he develops his ideas that even contrary forms of wisdom have shaped the thinking of Western civilization. And it's here that he sounds almost Hegelian in his push towards greater knowledge through conflict and synthesis.One area I had hoped Bloom had developed more is the distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Are they synonymous? Is all knowledge wisdom? Is some more valuable to the individual than other knowledge?Bloom describes those writers whose brand of wisdom he holds in highest esteem. And it's here that I wanted Bloom to articulate specific criteria for the types of literature he would categorize as lending to wisdom. He certainly elevates some works above others. For instance he places Shakespeare, Cervantes, and others above the fray. Additionally, he includes some books of the bible like Ecclesiastes and Job. So, he elevates this subset, but then within this subset he doesn't seem to allow for a hierarchy - placing them all on equal footing. My questions would be...1. Why are some works elevated above others?2. What criteria can be used to identify works of wisdom?3. Within the subset Bloom advocates how do we know none of these should be seen as more conducive for conveying wisdom?4. Do some works of literature accurately describe the human condition and others prescribe a resolution to that condition? If so, which is of more value?5. What is the ultimate source of wisdom?Even with these questions posed; Bloom has made great contributions to the analysis of classic literature and ideas - in many of his books. And here is another example, well worth reading.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	Chopra's book can be summed up in a few statements...."What you seek, you already are, and you seek what you already are for the world is in you for you are the world and the world is you. Accept this single secret of unified reality and you will succeed in extinguishing yourself." However, I found the book raising more questions than answering questions.1. If I am the world and the world is me - then when I see pain, suffering and evil in the world, am I seeing myself?2. If my goal is to realize that I am one with the universe then should I strive to reform culture and fight for justice - or should I accept things as they are?3. If I am truly free when I am not a person then is suicide a valid option?4. When someone offends me, should I seek to honestly communicate that to them, or should I recognize they are part of me and let it go?5. If my ultimate goal is to extinguish myself, then should I work on subduing my desires, dreams, and passions - or should I pursue those things?6. What is the ultimate purpose and meaning in life if all is one?7. If evil is not my enemy then should I fight against it or should I embrace it?8. If I am in communion with the whole of life - why do I experience disappointment?9. Is change real or imagined?10. Is there a difference between the renewed and the old - or are differences illusions?In short, I found Chopra's book to be more ethereal, and the pratical aspects didn't seem to flow logically from the spiritual assertions. In the end I was left spinning in a fog nearing vertigo. Did I miss something?
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Ehrman proceeds with grace and generosity regarding the fictional work `The Da Vinci Code' - readily reminding readers that it is a novel, which Brown intended as a novel. However, regarding the historical claims from the book Ehrman proceeds with clarity and precision as he focuses on 10 areas of concern.I didn't see that Ehrman is not concerned with theology. His 10 areas of concern all have significant theological implications. That is, if Ehrman is concerned with truth, which he obviously is, then his New Testament scholarship has theological consequences. The difference is, he appears to limit his bias in his historical analysis.In short, while Ehrman is quick to give the `story' of the Da Vinci Code high marks he is quick to point out numerous factual errors as he systematically debunks the books claims. He points out that...1. The Dead Sea Scrolls were not early `Christian' documents - but were rather copies of Old Testament books by a Jewish fringe group.2. Not all of the Jewish men in the first century were married, but rather many chose to remain celebate.3. Gnostic gospels were late documents which didn't have an enormous impact on Christian thought.4. The role of women in the early church was distinct from the cultural norms.5. Constantine didn't choose the four canonical gospels from a vast number of competing `gospels'.6. There is not a strand of historical evidence suggesting Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene.7. Nor did the church suppress `gospels' that told of a secret marriage.8. Jesus was considered divine from the earliest stages of Christianity - far earlier than the fourth century.9. There are not thousands or even hundreds or even dozens of documents, which suggest the New Testament isn't historically reliable. Thos documents simply don't exist.10. The New Testament documents which do exist have withstood intense scholarly scrutiny.I don't mean to imply that Ehrman only focuses on the errors of Brown's book. Ehrman also includes much captivating analysis on how good scholarship of early Christian writings proceeds with caution in order to ensure clarity, reliability, and exactness.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	I found Williamson's book to be emotionally compelling, and at the same time raising questions... let me share a few.Williamson writes well on the importance of learning from change. Her recommendations to embrace love and get rid of fear is something I know I certainly want. However, I began to wonder. Are there things I shouldn't love? Likewise, are there things I should be afraid of? If so, it would have been helpful if Williamson had identified some examples.She also suggests we're not responsible for bad things that happen to us. However, is that always the case? Am I responsible for the choices I make? I wish Williamson had explained her claim further.Additionally, Williamson says there are many turns we take in life that make us feel regret, guilt, sorrow, or pain. And then suggests we must learn to 'push past' those things. I wonder, are there things in my life I really should feel regret and guilt for? If so, what does 'pushing past' those things mean?On another note, Williamson suggests we must not give into our egos, which tell us we are separate from God, but instead surrender to God, 'of whom we are all a part'. Shortly thereafter she writes that we must go "from asking God to change the world to praying that He change us". If I need to be changed by God, then is that change intellectual, moral, or something else? Furthermore, does asking imply God is a disctinct person? I wanted her to be more specific.I hope the questions I've raised will be of benefit to readers. They've risen from my desire to know rightly and to be true to the truth.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	0	Hewitt suggests the blogosphere allows for the organization of dissent, which is focused, credentialed, complete, and--crucially--publicized. In short, he champions blogs as the force providing accountability to `legacy media'.Any fair-minded observer of `legacy media' would conclude not all journalism is good journalism. Of course, likewise, not all blogs are good journalism either. However, the point Hewitt makes is that, instead of a one-sided, agenda-driven media, we've been given balance through the quickness and efficiency of the blogsosphere. That is, one of the ways blogs provide benefits is through their timely response to periodic mainstream media error.Hewitt claims the `old media' is increasingly devoid of serious scholarship, and is slowly being reduced to mere polemic. The irony here is that Hewitt's communicating in one of the oldest media forms - the book. OK, to be fair, Hewitt isn't suggesting all other media forms are 'legacy', rather, he's pointing to the perviously dominate outlets more than the forms. (LA Times beware, and you too Newsweek and CBS.)In short, he suggests the blogs must be taken seriously, and they are rapidly becoming so. There are too many qualified journalists who run blogs for them not to have an enormous impact on our changing world. Finally, Hewitt claims the accountability they provide is long overdue.Has Hewitt been wrong before? Of course he has - he claimed national security was going to be far and away the primary voter issue of 2004. However, is he likely right about the increasing importance of the blogosphere, and why it's growing in influence and power? I believe so.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	In contemplating ideas from the book, I have a few questions about desires, where they come from, when they are to be followed. If you've read this book, and have answers to these questions, please let me know...1. Should desires always be followed?2. If not, how does a person rightly evaluate their own desires? 3. That is, are there things, which I want which I shouldn't want?4. What if a person has every desire of their heart, but still has no happiness, no peace, and no joy?5. Does that mean happiness is not found in our desires?6. Or does it mean there's something more - beyond our desire for our own happiness which we are designed for?7. Do bad things ever happen to good people?8. If so, were those things attracted by the person?9. Let's say a 14-year-old girl comes down with Leukemia, should she try to figure out what she did to attract the disease?10. If not and her plight can be attributed to something else then what is that?11. If God exists, and I experience blessing in my life, can I attribute those good things to Him, or must I attribute them to myself?12. Were we designed to live for something other than our self? It seems so.13. I've found there's an emptiness in my pursuing what I want so I can get what I want and have what I want. Is that possible?14. How can I re-orient my desires outwardly towards others, love, God, self-giving, self-sacrifice, and encouragement?
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	With Polhemus being the chair of Stanford's English department, he's certainly a qualified writer. However, I wished he'd have co-author this book with an ethics professor, or an Old Testament authority, or at least someone respected in the field of religious studies - as this would have lended to the books' strength and credibility.The reason I suggest this is because the premise which the book rests on is derived from the Torah manuscript of Genesis - and with that said, I'm not convinced Polhemus treats this text fairly. I'd like to suggest why.To rightly understand what Polhemus calls the, "disreputable Bible story of father-daughter incest" a firm grasp on both the literary context and the cultural context of the event is helpful. With that said, even a plain reading of the text shows these incestual events are not merely the result of passions run astray.Lot's daughters believed themselves and their father the sole survivors of universal destruction; humankind, they thought, depended on their breaking taboo by procreating with their father. As a result, they succeed in getting their father drunk, and then fulfilling their plan to have children through him. The manuscript gives no indication that Lot initiated this event, nor does it suggest his daughters were drawn to him for any other reason than their desire for children.Polhemus places this account in the the modern context of older men desiring younger women and younger women being thirsty for the power and wealth of older men. In his words, "...in which daughters fall in love with their father's lives and older men are tempted by the intoxicating power and promise of youth".Certainly, both of these motivating factors (lust for youth and lust for power) may be true in what we observe today in society, but to derive those conclusions from this ancient text is to unnaturally reshape the story itself.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	My questions below relate to items I believe need further explanation in light of the claims made in the book. The authors present nine categories claimed to present `clutter' or `box baggage' for modern churches. These are the things the authors believe should be left behind in order to embrace `innovation'....1. Hierarchy - What does a hierarchy-free church look like? Would elders/deacons constitute hierarchy?2. Structure/Organization - What is a modern day example of an effective, unorganized worship service?3. Property/Location - Which contemporary churches exist with no property or location?4. Conflict - Not sure what this means.5. Centralized Control - If there is no `centralized control' does this mean there is no headship?6. Ordination - Is ordination when a church body examines a person's beliefs and qualifications for ministry in light of scripture?7. Clergy - As far as I know there are no clergy-free churches in my area. This one is difficult to imagine.8. Seminaries - I guess this one is self-evident. If there is no ordination, control, or clergy there would be no need for seminaries.9. Denominations - Is to abandon denominations the same as abandoning doctrinal statements? If so, what would differentiate churches if not their core beliefs?What does it mean for the church to `move forward'? Is innovation simply moving away from the things the church has always done? What are the foundational elements of the church, which if left behind would leave the church with no real effect? I wish the authors had attempted to identify those things which can and should never change.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	0	First of all, as far as entertainment goes the Star Wars series is some of the best! Furthermore, I realize there's real spiritual hunger that causes people to be drawn to Star Wars. It's a powerful series, with a powerful story. However, the answer to that spiritual hunger cannot be found in the films.While there are some similarities between Jedi teachings and the biblical worldview, the differences are far greater. As a result, I wish Staub had been more thorough in contrasting the two belief systems instead of primarily comparing the similarities.Staub wants to emphasize the similarities in order to assist, "Christians who want to claim Jedi wisdom as their own." My question is, what if Jedi wisdom is contrary to scripture - should that wisdom still be pursued?Staub writes, "Star Wars seems to have stolen our message and wrapped it in science fiction." What message is that? There's a God in heaven who loves us? Humanity is separated from Him because of sin? Jesus died on the cross to forgive us, redeem us to the Father, and bring us a newness of life? These are the beliefs of Christians everywhere. However, none of these elements are found in the Star Wars series. As a result, Staub's claims are either an over-simplification or he's reading too much into the films.Remember, a Jedi sees the force as the binding piece that holds all life together. It's said to surround us and direct our actions. In this worldview the `force' resembles more of a pantheistic teaching than a biblical one. More specifically, if everything is part of the `force' then everything is one. This stands in contrast to the Christian view which claims God is separate and distinction from creation, as well as a personal being. The `force' is not personal, nor loving, nor capable of having personal relationships. Perhaps the greatest distinction is that the `force' has both a light side and a dark side - the God of the Bible is light and there is no darkness in Him. (I John 1)Lastly, and most importantly, was Jesus a Jedi? No, Jesus wasn't trying to tap into some universal force. He was (and is) the Creator of the Universe and all of its laws. He certainly didn't use mind control to influence people. He spoke the truth and allowed people to accept or reject - Him. He was better than any Jedi could be.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Paglia offers a book to a generation absorbed with images, detached from the interior of culture. Paglia writes, "The only antidote to the magic of images is the magic of words.'' Here she demonstrates the power of words for suggesting images better than those seen with eyes.Paglia is captivated by poetry. The reader's interest develops when she carefully (maybe a little dryly) commentates on one poem at a time - avoiding general brushstrokes as she identifies the subtleties from various lines. As it's been said, "from this book you could doubt several aspects of her taste in poetry. But you couldn't doubt her love of it."You can hear Paglia's disappointment when she writes, "Along the way I've encountered so many people in the publishing world, in magazines, who said to me, you know, 'I always keep up with the new novels, but not poetry.' These are really literary people, and even they feel poetry no longer speaks to them."Paglia suggests an explanation for the decline in the love of poetry, "Thanks to 25 years of post-structuralism in our elite colleges, we have this idea now that you are supposed to use your pseudo-sociological critical eye to look down on the work and find everything that's wrong with it," ...this style of teaching just nips students' enthusiasm in the bud."However, her statement is tempered by what I appreciate most - her discrimination regarding true talent and her lack of tolerance for those poetry artists who insist on using it as an instrument of civil rights - while at the same time lacking excellence in their work.While Paglia's selection of 43 poems may be `eclectic', she comments on superior works including Shelley's retro-prophetic `Ozymandias', Coleridge's heroic `Kubla Khan', and Wallace Stevens's gem `Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock'Paglia's strength is teaching us how to visualize implication in the once inconsequential, and thereby to making a poem alive and memorable. Perhaps that's the very purpose of poetry.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Pelikan provides an exceptional overview on the happenings of the Bible since its inception. He does so in a humble and accessible approach by limiting scholarship as an end in itself. Rather, he knows when when to convince the reader with compelling evidence, and when to back away from mere dogmatic assertion.Certainly the Bible possesses some of the finest, most staggering, and beautiful statements every recorded. Additionally, it's a book placing love, fear, and conviction in the hearts of people through various times, and in diverse places. As a result, it's been the subject of some of the most contested battles witnessed through the corridors of history.The central 'shift' in history which Pelikan outlines is the reaction against a highly symbolic form of biblical interpretation common in the middle ages, and in some ancient times. The conviction that perhaps the Bible literally means what it says was, to put it mildly, revolutionary. Of course this assertion manifested itself in the reaction against Rome as it played out in the reformation. And Pelikan allows these events to come to light and life.Pelikan's last chapter is a compilation of reflections on the Bible, including its persistent mystery, its enduring qualities, and its ability to capture our hearts and minds. Here is the pinnacle of the book as Pelikan finishes strong on one of the most captivating of subjects - Holy writ.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	First of all, because McLaren does such a superb job of cloaking his propositions in fictional dialog, it would perhaps be an oversimplification to suggest this book is merely a deconstruction of the Christian doctrine of hell. McLaren does more than this when he suggests there's a need to break down the notion of hell in order to allow people to re-imagine something better. This, he says, allows people to more fully understand God's grace. - p.106In brief McLaren asserts: Hell is a metaphor, not a reality - p.80 People suffer enough in this world for hell to be real - p.85 If hell is real then people are seen as disposable - p.83 The doctrine of hell led to the holocaust - p.83 Anyone who suggests others are going to hell cannot love them - p.83However, here's my thinking - if hell really does exist, if it's a place outside of God's goodness, love, beauty, then it seems that magnifies God's grace. That is, if the Christian has truly been 'saved' from something horrible, then the cross becomes something awesome, worthy of being held onto, and Jesus is rightly called the Savior.McLaren's further assertions are these:1. Jesus isn't concerned with our believing the right things, rather He wants actions and fruit bearing - p.121 (Isn't it possible to do the right things for the wrong reasons? If so, is right belief necessary for right action?)2. The gospel of Jesus isn't an answer to the human sin problem, rather it's God's love for the world - p.134 (If Jesus' death and suffering on the cross wasn't for our sin problem, then why did God allow Him to die?)3. Post-protestant churches see 'everything' as spiritual formation. There's nothing worth disagreeing about - p.142 (Would this include Mormon, Jehovah Witness, and Unitarian churches? Is there any doctrinal issue worth taking a stand on?)4. Justification by grace through faith isn't the gospel. The gospel is about bringing Jews and Gentiles together. (How was this accomplished if not through Jesus' death and the subsequent justification of believers?)5. The church exists to focus on the good of the world and thereby be a blessing to the world. (Does the church primarily exist as the bride of Christ, and to bring glory and pleasure to God?)In summary McLaren holds to a universalistic view that all people will be judged at the end of the world for both the good and the bad they've done. Hell is not a reality. Therefore, do the best you can in fighting for social justice and change in this world. However, that's not a Christian worldview, because that's not the gospel - rather the good news of Jesus being the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world is.Jesus alone is hope. May we seek to please Him for what He's done for us - not the other way around. And thereby remain 'earthly good' while being 'heavenly minded'.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Weigel suggests Europe is a society adrift, untied from the source of its greatness - the very cultural foundation which provided the values making Europe great is now disintegrating, leaving Europe (and soon the entire West) on sinking sand. More specifically, as the past is erased, re-written, or ignored the rich Judeo-Christian history of Europe is being left behind. And at what cost?Weigel asks provocative questions... Why is European productivity dwindling to an all time low? Why is European politics rife with senselessness? Why does Sweden have a considerably higher level of its population living below the poverty line? Why is Europe undergoing the 'greatest sustained reduction in European population since the Black Death of the 14th century'?Could the recent woes of Europe be tied to the ever decreasing Christian minority on this now decidedly post-Christian continent?As I ponder Weigel's book I'm reminded of Orwell's quote, "We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men." Weigel restates the obvious, "culture determines civilization". And he goes on to say, without its distinctly Christian history, Europe would not be what it is. Unfortunately, he may have more accurately written, `Europe would not have been what it was.'However, from the perspective of the Christian tradition there is more to lament than the secondary effects of a decline in productivity, and art. That is, merely reviving religion as an end in itself is not what Europe needs, but rather a call back to its first love, the God who blesses and rewards those who diligently seek Him.Of course the current intellectual elites regard God as an embarrassment as they continue to scoff at His name. What is the final price? The world has yet to know.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	0	1	First of all, Johnson leaves little doubt that today's entertainment is more sophisticated than, say, the entertainment in the 1970s. That's a reasonable claim and he makes his points convincingly. However, other sections of the book brought questions. Allow me to explain.Is someone who is quick to absorb the visual stimulation of pop-culture a 'smart' person? It seems the intelligent person not only digests ideas, but produces them. Thinking creatively and originally is different than merely reacting to and retaining data - whether that's data from a text book, a movie, or a video game.Here's the point Johnson seems to gloss over, mental stimulation is not a virtue in itself. To build on that, is all learning (knowledge) 'good'? More specifically, is there a difference between wisdom and trivia? See, that's the huge question Johnson misses. If he proves all 'facts' are equal in their importance then his thesis becomes much stronger. However in the real world some knowledge is far less important than other knowledge.Let me use an example. Say we have two kids - aged 10. One kid can tell you the title, manufacturer, plot-line, and year of every video game ever produced. The other kid can recite the Declaration of Independence, tell you who signed it and why it's important. I'd suggest while both kids may be equally 'smart', both are not equally intelligent.Here's the point. Johnson is so focused on defending the media forms of today that he ignores the messages they send us. At the same time he uses the term 'good' in the title of his book. That's a term of value differentiation. Is he implying some things are 'good' and others are not? That's a moral distinction. If that's what he's saying, then what would be the 'bad' that could be promoted via today's media? ... a preoccupation with murder? sex? hedonism? Are those things bad? I wish he would have at least attempted to deal with the content (messages) of pop-culture.Here's the bottom line. Let's assume pop-culture is making us smarter. A different question would be, is it also making is better? Is it actually good for us? Is it building character, courage, heroism, altruism, and charity? I remain unconvined that it is.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Here's Mr. Graham's magnum opus - his final word. He seeks to answer those big questions every person has asked at some point. Questions like: Why am I here? Where did I come from? Where am I going? How should I live?He writes, "God has given us a blueprint for living - but we must know what it is and then put it into action,". That statement almost makes it sound like Mr. Graham's interpretation of Christianity is a moralistic one - follow these principles and all will be OK. However, that's not essentially what the minister is saying. His writing makes it clear that no matter how good a person is every person falls short of God's standard. As a result, every person needs forgiveness. And that's Mr. Grahams message - forgiveness. It's the one he's been preaching for decade after decade. God loves you. God wants a relationship with you. God's forgiveness is offered through His Son Jesus.Why does God allow bad things to happen? Mr. Graham says he's not sure, but He is confident that God is good and allows things for a reason. He says there is purpose we may never know in this lifetime. He says, "But at the end of it, it's going to be the coming of Christ, and that's the hope that we really have ..."Graham boldly declares that there's no other answer to the problems of humanity than the good news of Jesus, the Messiah, the peacemaker, the sacrifice, and the King.These are the writings of a humble 87 year old man. One who claims he has regretted not spending more time in prayer, and reading his Bible.
A1EU0MJNWK4YVV	1	1	Erin Gruwell cares about kids, which is why she cares about teaching. Her goal is to have all students enjoy reading and writing. This book is her story of doing just that - getting kids to love learning. Clearly this hasn't been an easy task, but it's been a rewarding one.In order for you to evaluate the book, here are some excerpts from the beginning of the book, which not only give an idea of the style she writes in, but the task she's up against. This is a rough public schoool.&lt;&lt; "Why do we have to read books by white guys in tights?" asked Sharaud, a foulmouthed sixteen-year-old, after he took one look at my syllabus.As I started to discuss the curriculum, my students rocked in their seats and played percussion with their pencils. Some checked their pagers, while others reapplied their eyeliner. Some slouched, some laid their heads on the desks, and some actually took a nap. This was not the reception I was hoping for on my first day as a student teacher.I dodged a paper airplane--made out of my syllabus, I quickly realized--and tried to make myself heard over a string of "yo mama" jokes...................Once the students left, I picked up the paper airplane off the floor. I circled the room, collecting handouts that had been left behind, and saw ESL scribbled in black marker on several desks on the left side of the room. In educational jargon, ESL stands for English as a Second Language. Earlier, when I'd seen ESL etched on my door, I'd foolishly thought some Spanish-speaker was paying homage to my classroom. I soon realized this ESL had nothing to do with education--it was the acronym for East Side Longos--the largest Latino gang in Long Beach.>>That's the beginning of the book - the rest is the story of how she cared for, taught, and gave these kids a passion for reading and writing.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	0	I got this charger because my regular Black and Decker charger died (along with my original battery, so it seems), and I saw that people were buying this one instead of the cheap B+D replacement that seems to have a short life. I charged up my new Firestorn PS145 battery with this one and it works fine; it also has indicators telling you when the battery is charging, when it's full, and when it's bad (which my old battery was). I saw that the B+D chargers can die when you put a bad battery in them, so I decided not to take a chance on that. I hope to be using this one as long as I have my Craftsman charger, which keeps going and going...
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	0	I'm conflicted about this review; while I'm happy with the replacement battery so far (I've only had it a couple of months), I was NOT happy about having to buy another one in the first place, nor having to buy a new charger, since they both seemed to have died at the same time. I bought a DeWalt charger instead, and it's working well.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	0	The winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward. Also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins. I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	As printer cartridges go, this one works well. Comparable price, haven't had a bad one nor have it clog up, so it works for me.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	This was one of those "might as well get one of these too, while I'm at it" purchases when I was ordering guitar polish. It's a good cloth for polishing, no more to say about it.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	Nothing much to say..the ink cartridge works well for as long as it lasts. The price was comparable to others.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	First off, no Boss or Digitech foot pedal is worth $35-$50, when you can build one easily for $20 or less. With that in mind, this pedal is another option for your Boss ME-50 multi-effects pedal, this one having three buttons instead of the two foot switches on the FS-6. This pedal used to be silver and blue, but has the same configuration, so if you come across one in good condition, they're the same. In memory mode the up/down momentary buttons are functional to change bank numbers, and in manual mode all three buttons work to turn on/off the compressor and/or tone modify settings (turn on/off each one, turn off both of them, toggle between them). This footwitch itself is fairly sturdy, but if you have a habit of kicking the switches sideways or putting your full weight on one you might be replacing the switches on a regular basis.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	I'm using this cable to connect my guitar effects pedal with the main controller. I've used it on different pedals, effects, and amp footswitches and it works well with all of them that need a stereo cable. Make sure you get the proper length for what you want (measure, don't guess!). The 3 foot length is good for floor control foot switches running to floor effects units, while you might want something a bit longer for controlling your amp or rack units.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	There may be cheaper inflators or ones are work as well, but this one is the standard; I decided not to take a chance with a copy. This is the inflator I remember as a child, inflating my bicycle tire at the local gas station, when every station did repair work and let you have air for free:), and I don't remember ever coming across one that didn't work. Maybe a little bit overkill for an occasional user, but it sure works well when you have a bunch of tires to inflate in a hurry and don't want to waste time looking for a separate gauge. Speaking of the gauge, it seems the window is smaller than I remember, but that's probably just my advanced-age eyesight.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	It has what you want in a cable, and not what you don't. Not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it, but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends. So there it is; nothing magical, just a guitar cable.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	0	I replaced the nasty, crooked, chipping plastic pins for these, and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be. I'm not convinced that they change the sound of my D-28 very much for better or worse. I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really couldn't tell much of a difference, still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones, so I consider them an upgrade.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	These 2 filters work great in my Rena XP3 pump, which is the best one I've had for my aquariums. I usually had those pumps that sit on the back of the tank, but they've never worked well no matter what the size of my tank.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	0	0	My original coupling lasted 10 years without a hitch, and even when it finally went, it chewed up the rubber portion (just like it's supposed to). This new set with the metal inserts only lasted 4 months before the insert started spinning inside the plastic piece. From my way of thinking, this is not better; the insert is harder to get off the shaft, and is harder to replace. Buy the old style if you can, or sell a kidney and buy a new front loading washer and deal with the mold/leakage and kneeling on the floor to load.
A1EUO0BU72JR7T	1	1	I recently picked up one of these used but didn't think to ask if an adaptor was included, since I figured I'd plug it into my Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 and I'd be good. Wrong! I tried a bunch of adaptors (the plug is a little bit bigger than your regular pedal adaptor), including the negative Pin one for some of the Fulltone pedals - in retrospect, I'm glad I didn't fry the Whammy, but it seems to have a high tolerance for mistmatches. Anyway, this adaptor works fine for my version (MIDI capable, not the version 5 model). I bought 2, because I have a few Digitech pedals and they never seem to play well with other adaptors.
A1EURDQK16GJ68	1	1	Bought this for my 5 month old grandson and it is a hit, he loves it. Best baby purchase yet.
A1EURDQK16GJ68	0	0	I tried this detergent based on the reviews and I am truly puzzled by the dazzling reviews this product has received. It did not get my laundry any cleaner and cost a bundle more than my regular laundry soap.It does have a VERY strong perfume, but that wears off and is not bad. But I would expect for $20 a bottle to be wowed and honestly I cannot say I saw a difference. So it is not worth the price difference.
A1EV60WNJXQDV0	1	1	I bought this for my 4 month-old twin boys, and they absolutely love it! The looks on their faces when they see this toy is full of wonder and amazement. They both love the trunk with the spinning ball on top, and it helps them learn how to reach and grasp for things. They love to spin the ball and giggle together when they do it. This toy is very cheerful and simple for a baby, and I highly recommend it!
A1EV60WNJXQDV0	0	1	This trivet is beautiful and looks great hanging on my wall, but the one complaint I have is that it has a terrible odor. When I opened the box, the scent was overwhelming. I think it's the paint, but it smells more like used motor oil or something you'd smell in an automotive shop. I washed it with soap and water several times, but the smell is not gone yet. I can't use it at the table, because the scent would be too unpleasant during mealtime. I've had it for about a week now, and the odor has not subsided at all yet. I have no idea what to do with this thing now!
A1EV60WNJXQDV0	1	1	I have been using this incense for approximately 17 years, and it's my all-time favorite. I love the scent, and the most important thing is that it does not cause me to have asthma attacks, like other incense. Perhaps it's because there isn't a stick inside, or perhaps it's because of the ingredients. I'm not sure. All I know is that I've tried many other varieties of sandalwood incense and always come back to this one.It's true that the sticks are thin and fragile, but I don't mind at all. As long as you treat them delicately, it's not a problem. The box is a nice package, compared to the paper sleeves that many other incense are packaged in.
A1EV60WNJXQDV0	1	1	I received this today, and it's absolutely beautiful! I was worried that it would be a cheap, light-weight plastic, like those you see in Kmart and Walmart. Surprisingly, the resin is more solid and sturdy. It looks exactly as it's portrayed in the picture on here, so there are no surprises. The ticking sounds of the second hand are very faint, too. It drives me crazy when I can hear a clock tick, so I'm glad that I have to actually put my ear up to this one to hear it. It takes one AA battery, and it measures 12.5 inches in diameter. As a bonus, Amazon did a great job with the packaging by using plenty of bubble wrap and air pillows.
A1EV60WNJXQDV0	1	1	I ordered this set 4 years ago, and it's still sturdy and reliable. There's no rust at all. I use the smallest one most often, mostly for eggs. I use the 2 larger ones for just about everything else.An excellent kitchen purchase you won't regret!
A1EVFVE0P7PDGB	1	1	I'm not an audiophile & these do the trick for me. I use them for commuting on the train. Fit's not perfect - a little big, but the price is right. I'll buy them again.
A1EVFVE0P7PDGB	1	1	Easy to fill. Just have to be a little bit careful. Pumps out TONS of pepper, whether fine grind or thick.
A1EVFVE0P7PDGB	1	1	The magnets are great. Not much guided activities though. I would have liked to have some lessons to work with my 8-yo. Don't store this near your computer. :)
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	0	This book is the story of how it sometimes takes catastrophe to dislodge people from their ruts and force them to redefine themselves. It also takes a very long, hard look at the relationships--familial and romantic--that all women experience in their lives and how they can be so forceful--for good or ill. Yes, this book is difficult (emotionally) to read, because we readers can stand on the sidelines and shout advice, but the characters don't hear us any more than the real people who come through our lives and break our hearts by following destructive paths. In the end, the characters have to deal with the consequences of how they've lived their lives. The good news is that for some, it's not too late to turn a new corner. In that respect, this book is a story of hope and redemption.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I had already read a few of these stories, but I made many new discoveries of authors to add to my reading list. I liked the way this collection was defined and arranged so that it was at once entertaining and informative. I feel like I learned a good deal about the genre's development in the process.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Gilman hits just the right note of poignancy in this story of a young girl who must use her wits and discover her unique talents to survive the harrowing journey to freedom when her missionary father commits suicide. It is easy to see the world through Gen's eyes as she struggles to determine who are her friends and who are her enemies in a land torn by war.Gilman does very well with the mystical elements, fitting them in so that they mesh with the world she describes to us and seem no less real than the rest of the story.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	The Lynley/Havers series shows steady improvement with this book, a complex mystery that takes on some of the class and education issues that are a little murky for the average American. Beyond exposing the evils in English public schools, it was an interesting examination of what sacrifices the characters made for their educations, and a questioning of what *did* they really learn all those years in school.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I live in the Ozarks myself (albeit a ways north of the border from Ms. Hess), so I can vouch for the fact that yes, people like the inhabitants of Maggody, Arkansas, do really exist. But it was a bit painful to see so many of them concentrated in one spot. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I hope Hess wasn't going for total realism in this book. (But if I have to wonder, I suppose it's a moot point.)So, some of it was just a tad too far over the top to be comfortable. But the puzzle was done well, and I did enjoy it a great deal, in spite of myself.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Very good, in fact. I don't think Paretsky had quite fashioned her own mold for the genre yet, so there are a few clich&eacute; elements in the book, but everything else is a highly original treat. Lots of great little twists throughout--not just plot twists, but different ways of looking at things. With V.I. Warshawski, Paretsky has created a heroine who is intelligent, engaging, and not afraid to shake things up. I haven't read much early V.I. yet, but I intend to, so I can get to know this woman from the beginning.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	0	This book was a bit of a departure, style-wise, and I liked they way Olivia's story was developed separately from the rest of the story line then woven in. I was a little disappointed not to see Simon and Deborah in this book, and I didn't see the deeply layered themes that I normally find in George's books. That was particularly surprising given the promise of the fire imagery. But this is still an extremely worthwhile read with some interesting plot twists.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	There is no doubt in my mind that JK Rowling has created a classic. The detail is phenomenal, and even when she borrows from the established fantasy world, she adds inspired touches and makes old ideas her very own. Rowling obviously understands instinctively how a 12-year-old child thinks and what his worries are, and she addresses this beautifully in her creation of Harry, his friends, and his enemies. I found myself wishing I had had Harry Potter when I was 12.I think what I liked best, though, was that I didn't get the feeling that Rowling set out to write a book for 12-year-olds. She doesn't talk down to her audience at all, and that gives the book universal appeal. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate the conflicts Harry encounters. In fact, Rowling seems to be pointing out that kids and adults aren't really all that different, even in the problems we face on a daily basis.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Gilman's charming spy is back, this time in a book that is more of a sequel than another series entry. Even if you don't normally read series books in order like I do, I strongly suggest you meet Kadi and friends in MRS POLLIFAX PURSUED before reading this one. Now our beloved Emily Pollifax is traveling to Kadi's home turf, Ubangiba, to untangle a web of political intrigue with her usual clever style.There was a noticeable lack of CIA presence in this book that made me wonder if Emily had made a copmlete break from the agency, but then I noticed INNOCENT TOURIST and UNVEILED both come after this one and seem to involve the CIA again. I found the clues a little easier to spot in this book than in earlier stories, but it was great fun putting them together for a satisfying conclusion. All in all, another great Mrs. Pollifax adventure.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I'm no expert on Native American music, but I am a flute player, so I can certainly appreciate the skill evident on this CD. (I found the alto flute difficult enough to maintain breath control on, so the ability to play the bass flute *really* impresses me.)I'm a little skeptical of &quot;mood music&quot; in general, but this music lacks the cheesiness found in the many productions of lesser quality that seem to dominate the music racks. The textures are rich and relaxing, making this the perfect CD for lighting a few candles and curling up with a good book at the end of a rough day.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	0	0	For having been written by somebody better known for her travel guides about Branson, this book certainly didn't make me want to jump in the car and go there. And I only live 30 miles away. The characters were broadly painted charicatures of &quot;country music folk,&quot; and Buckstaff failed to capture any true sense of place in her descriptions. Even though her protagonist eventually comes to grudging terms with her Ozarks heritage, the reader doesn't get any feel for what makes Branson so uniquely compelling.Oh yeah, this is a murder mystery, too. In a shallow, jumbled, afterthought kind of way. To be fair, it wasn't simply horrible. Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, at any rate. But the plot was lacking in drive and suspense, with seemingly random curves (none would qualify as twists, in my opinion). And that bit with the violin bow would have been silly had it not been so unnecessary as to be offensive. Actually, this could have been a pretty good read had the author been more in tune with the sensibilities of the traditional mystery reader. As it is, however, it reads like a half-hearted cross-over attempt by somebody who heard that mysteries are selling well.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Maron transports you to small-town North Carolina and introduces you around to some of the best developed characters in mystery fiction. Deborah Knott is definitely a good one to know, and it is interesting to watch her as she handles her personal and internal conflicts with style and wit.In this beginning of the Deborah Knott series, a local teen seeks answers about her mother's death years ago, and Deborah has to delve into history that some locals would much prefer remain buried. It makes for an intriguing puzzle, and Maron places the clues fairly. Maron also treats the reader to an examination of small-town dynamics that affect not only Knott's political race to become a judge, but could put a new face on her personal and family relationships as well.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Chief Detective-Inspector Alleyn enlists the assistance of his well connected society friend Lord Robert 'Bunchy' Gospell to find out who is blackmailing several wealthy ladies. The charming Bunchy makes several interesting discoveries while making the rounds of &quot;the London season,&quot; but is quite unfortunately murdered before he can and Alleyn can piece together the whole story.As usual, Marsh places her clues very fairly but subtly. The backdrop of the debutante parties gives an interesting behind the scenes glimpse of 1930s London society, and if you like your mysteries peopled with lots of peers, this book is for you.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	No murders in this book, but plenty of mystery and no end of Art Deco style. Imagine one of Agatha Christie's stories from &quot;The Golden Ball&quot; collection with enough plot twists to sustain a 252-page novel. It's 1929, and Car Fairfax is penniless and unemployed. Suddenly he receives a mysterious offer to earn 500 pounds. Coincidentally, his friend Fay is in urgent need of 500 pounds. Before too long, it seems like everybody Car knows is concerned one way or another with this 500 pounds, and Car is having the worst time figuring out who is trying to restore his reputation and finances, and who is trying to frame him for crimes varying from forgery to smuggling.This is a wonderfully detailed story with a weblike plot that snares the reader quickly and won't let go. I highly recommend it to any fan of Golden Age mysteries.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	0	I bought this for my husband when this was still the only item of its kind on the market. I imagine there are better products out now, but he's still quite happy with it despite a few minor elements of poor design, like the arrangement of the controls. As soon as he got it, he tried playing a CD he got as a freebie from mp3.com, and that didn't work, but as soon as he burned a CD of his own with mp3 files, it worked just great. I also bought a car kit to go with it, and we only got it to work two out of about 10 times, but I don't think that was the Genica player's fault.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	We have had ours for years, and it still works great. You do have to remember to let the battery completely run down twice a year, though, in order to extend its life.I know Consumer Reports said that it doesn't matter if you use this or a regular toothbrush as long as you brush for two minutes, but we've never paid much attention to the two-minute rule (and certainly wouldn't pay extra for a timer), and as soon as we started using this, our check-ups improved dramatically. Maybe it's because this massages the gums so nicely that we wind up brushing longer than we do with our regular brushes, and we don't even realize it.My only real complaint is the expense of the replacement brush heads. As you can see from the &quot;accessories&quot; section, they are almost $7 each. But it's still worth it.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	This is a very pretty frame, great for an outdoor portrait. You can't be in a hurry, though, because it takes a little finesse to get the photo in without damaging it.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	This is one of the funnest computer games of any kind I have ever played. I am about halfway through it, and the story is intriguing and imaginatively done. Even if you get stuck on some of the puzzles, you can still wander around and have fun while you are mulling it over. The characters are a lot of fun, and I love the graphics in this. So far, it seems like you can't die (your progress is just slower if you make the wrong decisions), so you also don't have to worry about saving your place before you try something &quot;risky.&quot; (My husband calls that &quot;invoking the spell of many saves.&quot;)The puzzles have a nice variety in difficulty, and this game is unique in seeming old-fashioned while at the same time being like nothing else you've ever played. In short, this is a fantastic game at a great price. Just buy it!!
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	My husband bought me one for Christmas, and it is a joy to use. I especially like that it is reusable. You don't have to order special refills, either. When I got this, I was already in the middle of another journal, so I just slipped out the blank one that came with this and slipped in my old one.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	*Someday* I *will* own the real thing, but in the meantime, this sitting on top of my file cabinet makes me very happy. There are only two things that could make this model cooler: the hood opening to reveal engine detail, and a version in taupe metallic frost.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I've had this for months now, and tonight is the very first time I have used it to slice anything. I've been having too much fun using it as a musical instrument. :-)By the way, it is a great slicer. It is easy to use and produces nice clean slices.Another reviewer mentioned that it is all stainless steel, and I don't think that is the case. The wires definitely are, but I believe the base is something other than stainless steel. I'm not sure what, but it is nice and sturdy, even if it isn't steel.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I am a master's student taking a course in research methods, and this was the first book of the semester. If you want an in-depth examination of research methods, no, this is not what you're looking for. But it did a great job of kicking off this course, which is designed for administrators who will more often be consumers of research than in-depth researchers themselves.It says it is &quot;An Overview of the Essentials,&quot; and it is just that. It is broken down into one-page topics that are written on a good level for those of us who haven't had a strong math/statistics background. Each topic is followed by a page of discussion questions that make it easy to make sure the concepts are grasped before moving on. It's in almost a workbook format, and I would recommend this as a self-guided study tool to any professional faced with the need to deal with these topics in the line of work.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	This is one of those books that sticks with you long after junior high. During a camping trip in the Florida Everglades, two girls find themselves separated from the group as a hurricane strikes. Despite their intense dislike for each other, they are forced to pool their resources and rely on each other's strengths in order to survive.This is a tale of unexpected courage, and I highly recommend it to girls in their early teens.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Revenge of the Gypsy Queen may be Kris's first book, but the lady is no newcomer to the mystery scene. Her extensive short mystery fiction r&eacute;sum&eacute; includes two Derringer Awards, one of which was for &quot;L.A. Justice.&quot; That is where sleuth wannabe Tracy Eaton debuted, and Tracy's fans were soon clamoring for a full-length novel. Kris Neri was kind enough to oblige.Tracy Eaton is the daughter of Hollywood celebrities, wife of straight-laced lawyer Drew Eaton, and a mystery writer who yearns for the cloak-and-dagger adventures her fictional sleuth enjoys. Revenge of the Gypsy Queen finds Tracy in New York City for the upcoming wedding of Drew's sister Marisa, and before long Tracy is living out her detective fantasy. The reasons, however, are unfortunate: Marisa has been kidnapped. A wealthy developer and a mobster have both taken an unusual interest in the restaurant Marisa and her fianc&eacute; Tony run. Drew's black sheep Uncle Philly is in town, behaving suspiciously, and under investigation by the NYPD's Special Frauds Squad. And Drew and the rest of his family seem to be trying to keep secrets from Tracy. The Eaton family, in fact, seems content to try to meet the kidnapper's bizarre demand-the sale of the restaurant The Gypsy Princess-without any police involvement, so it falls to Tracy to be the &quot;sensible one&quot; for a change and get to the bottom of the mystery.Of course, Tracy's definition of &quot;sensible&quot; is a bit wide of the mark. All the more fun for the readers who follow her as she crawls beneath cars, tails suspects, dodges various instruments of death and destruction, beards VIPs in their dens, and delves into the family secrets. Neri has created in Tracy a lovable writer-turned-sleuth who takes all the horrible clich&eacute;s that implies and pummels them into submission with her unique sense of humor.The story's resolution is also fresh. The grand finale, which requires the talents of a supermodel and a small army of-well, I can't tell you what without spoiling all the fun-is only the beginning of the end. True to the book's title, Neri spins a tale of revenge that leads Tracy into the dilemma of weighing the value of the absolute truth against justice. Fortunately, Tracy has the resilience to grow from the experience without losing her impetuous spirit. And that means I'll be reading Tracy's next adventure, Dem Bones' Revenge, as soon as possible.(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	This is early Christie and definitely a product of its time. Much more personal than her regular mystery stories, these exude '20s style and mysticism. The first half of the book seems devoted to young people and adventure, with a great deal of attention to the recurring motif of the car representing freedom and the jewels imbuing their wearers with special traits.In the second half, Christie delves deeper and deeper into the occult, going from Atlantis theories to reincarnation to &quot;the gift&quot; to metamorphosis to the ghostly sobbing of dead children. Even as I reject the pushiness of the occult aspects of these stories, I am thoroughly entertained by Christie's writing style. Her dialogue is simply enchanting, and even though I recognize the flaws in this collection, I find myself often drawn to re-reading it to escape into a whole different world.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	This was the first VI Warshawski book I ever read, and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more. I think Paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into VI's world, which is rich with unique characters. VI comes across as individualistic and principled, and I like how Paretsky resisted clich&eacute; temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no &quot;obligatory sex scene.&quot; Not that sex scenes don't have their places, but I just hate it when I'm reading along and I can almost hear the agent say, &quot;Okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book.&quot; In this story, VI is all business, which is a delightful change of pace.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	The subtitle, &quot;Bullets, Booze and Broads,&quot; is a highly accurate summation of this short story collection. There is certainly no mistaking this book for a cozy tea party at the vicarage. In all honesty, I'm much more a cozy fan than a hardboiled fan, and the more graphic sex scenes pushed my &quot;too much information&quot; button. Bracken tells a good story, though, and there is no denying that Nathaniel Rose has a distinctive voice.All of the stories are set in St. Louis, and as someone who visits St. Louis maybe once every few years, I enjoyed Rose's tour of some of those sites not on the typical tourist itinerary. The city's unique personality comes through very subtly yet effectively, seeming to make the setting a character of its own.I was particularly impressed with the plot lines, both within each story and in the progression of stories. Bracken's plot twists are fresh and innovative where so many hardboiled stories fall back on the tried and true devices. Bracken even seems to poke fun at some of those hardboiled conventions, like when Rose describes how he and his secretary are caught by surprise when a client actually shows up completely unannounced. The character development as Rose proceeds from &quot;Partners&quot; (first published in 1988) through four stories from the 1995 collection Even Roses Bleed, to the final two stories written for this anthology, also indicate Bracken's concentration on craft. And despite my cozy leanings, I couldn't help but admire Bracken's willingness to shed just about anybody's blood in order to keep the plot coherent.If you like your fiction brief and noir (and maybe even if you don't) I think you'll find Tequila Sunrise an intoxicating treat.(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Well, on computer accessory, anyway. I almost bought the m100 to save a little money, but as quickly as I'm adding info to this thing, I'm glad I splurged for the extra memory. This is so much more useful than any pen and paper method I've tried for organizing my life.Finding a good case for this new shape, though, was a bit of a challenge. It didn't help any that I despise Velcro, which most of the cases use to secure the Palm m100 series. But as I also love my pen &amp; ink, I hit on an excellent compromise. I found a smallish zippered DayRunner that, once the paper calendar is removed, provides just enough room for the Palm (with the cover still on, at that), a pocket for notepaper, two pen loops, credit card slots, and a zippered pocket that is great for tickets and receipts and the like. It even has an external pocket for my phone. And the whole thing still weighs but a small fraction of what my old leatherbound paper calendar folio did.My only real complaint is not with the m105 itself, but with the HotSync cradle design, which seems purposely designed not to work with my husband's Palm III. Switching to a USB HotSync cable for my m105 then rendered *his* cradle inoperative. Fortunately, the cable will work with his Palm III, even though it also was not designed to do so. If that didn't work, we'd be completely out of luck, and I would be one extremely unhappy customer.By the way, if you get a Palm of any kind, install the AvantGo program. Even if you don't have wireless service, you'll be amazed at the increased use you get out of your handheld by syncing to your favorite websites. It's so nice to never be bored. Stuck in a line somewhere, waiting at the doctor's office, whatever...I can just pull out my Palm and read CNN or Le Monde or HandHeld Crime or whatever else I've told it to download that morning.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Fearless Jones is a thriller, yes, but it is also a story about friendship and courage. The novel is narrated by Paris Minton, a black bookstore owner in 1954 Watts. Minton is not a troublemaker and has a hard time understanding why his friend, war hero Fearless Jones, always seems to attract trouble. When trouble--in the person of Elana Love--arrives quite uninvited in Minton's own bookstore, though, understanding begins to dawn.No sooner has Love walked into Minton's life than he is brutally assaulted by her pursuer, then seduced, robbed, and abandoned by Miss Love herself. When Minton returns to his bookstore the next day, he finds it a pile of ash and rubble. Not knowing where else to turn, he finally relents and bails his friend Fearless out of jail. That's when the action really heats up.The plot is far too complex for me to try to boil down into a few short paragraphs, and that is one thing I love about Mosley's books. There is so much coming from all directions that there is no sense of a scenario manufactured for tidy wrap-up by page 300. The characters are also so well developed that you can imagine them going about their off-page lives even when Paris isn't around to tell us about it.As Paris and Fearless try to unravel the mess, it entangles them in the lives of a Jewish immigrant family, a chase after the spoils of war, a variety of fraudulent schemes, and a violent power struggle within a mysterious religious organization--the one Elana Love was looking for when she found Paris by mistake. They do manage to sort things out eventually, and that in itself is a fascinating adventure. Just as exciting, however, are the lessons in loyalty and betrayal.(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	There have been no end of parodies and weak imitations due to the popularity of this book, and that popularity is well founded. Suzy Becker nails it! This is all about the true essence of cats and the feline qualities of their humans. If you don't recognize yourself and/or your cat in these cartoons, you are simply not human.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	If you don't like mushy love stories or have a problem with that suspension of disbelief thing, then don't bother, because you won't give this book the attention it deserves. If you like a healthy dose of fantasy and romance in your mysteries, though, you will love this book. Atherton immediately draws you into Aunt Dimity's world, which is at once gentle and heartwrenching. And rarely do you find a writer with such a gift for flow. I found myself being carried along by the story much in the way a great symphony seems to transport me away from the mundanities of real life.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	I recently purchased this edition to give to a friend as a gift, and I was pleased to see that it had some nice extras, like du Maurier's early notes for the book. I would definitely recommend this edition over the Avon edition, in part because I noticed that the Avon edition lists du Maurier as the author of that horrid sequel attempt, which was actually excreted by Susan Hill. There's no telling what to expect from a publisher capable of such a mistake.As for the novel itself, my original glowing review still stands. This story will never lose its appeal for me.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	0	It took a great deal of swearing to get the original faceplate off, but it was worth it to personalize my m105 with this very attractive Silver Snake pattern. The pictures onscreen don't do it justice, and I find that it's not at all distracting.
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	0	Apparently nobody else out there has thought to use the Hawaiian word for trouble in a book title, because if you type just "pilikia" into the amazon search engine, it takes you straight to this book. And this title does make good use of the word. The story is set in Hawaii, and the protagonist, Val Lyon, is a private investigator who does indeed encounter her fair share (and then some) of pilikia in a day's work.This particular pilikia begins when a lawyer from a prominent island family hires Val to find the adolescent son of his client, who is being jailed for contempt for failing to produce the boy during a messy custody battle. The mother claims that her ex-husband has abused the boy and that, although she sent him away for his safety, she doesn't know exactly who has him or where he is. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for Val, the mother lets slip the name Harriet, and the hunt is on. Before long, Val finds herself entangled in much more than the search for the missing child. For one thing, people start getting killed, and Val is almost one of them. Then she discovers that the family of the lawyer who hired her has a lot of connections (none of them very pleasant) to the case at hand. It doesn't help any that she also starts falling for her lawyer client.This is some deep pilikia that Val has to wade out of, but she does so admirably, even if she becomes terribly wounded in the process. One of the most striking things about this book is Val's character, which is complex and intriguing and very realistic. If I didn't know Mark personally, I'd swear he was a woman writing under a male pseudonym, because he has a clear understanding of female characters. The male characters are good, too, but sometimes they seem a little limited by the roles they have to play in the story.The story line is another of the book's strengths. It is suspenseful and manages to be complex without descending into the sort of confusion that happens when authors just dump cartloads of red herrings wherever they can. Just a tiny bit of what may be a spoiler, however: if you have any more than a passing interest in genetics, you will probably be a few steps ahead of Val once the clues start turning up. That doesn't detract from this great tropical thrill ride, though, and I look forward to reading more of Val's adventures. Before long, I suspect pilikia will be Val's middle name, not just her occupation.**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**
A1EVKGF2TNSI4	1	1	Eight years after young Patrick Ashby's disappearance and presumed suicide, a young man presents himself to the Ashby family lawyers as the long-lost heir--just in time to reclaim the family estate from his slightly younger twin brother Simon on their approaching 21st birthday. He knows intimate details of Patrick's childhood and passes all of the tests devised by the lawyers to reveal an imposter. (The family's dental records in London were apparently destroyed during the war.) Could it be? Has the prodigal son returned home? In a word, no.That's not a spoiler, mind you. You'll learn as much on the back-cover blurb, and chapter 3 reveals the imposter in no uncertain terms as Brat Farrar, a foundling who grew up in an orphanage and spent much of his teen years exploring the American West. By the end of chapter 4, it doesn't take a whole lot of pondering to figure out 90% of what's really going on. It's just a matter of following along to see how it all plays out.I know that sounds boring, but it's rather an enjoyable read. You can look at it as being slow-moving, or as having a leisurely pace. If you take the latter attitude, I think you'll have a better appreciation of the manner in which Tey examines Brat's moral struggles and unfolds the layers of mystery surrounding the Ashby family.**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	Within my admittedly limited experience, Masterpiece Theater dramatizations of great books are well produced and faithful to the original. This is no exception.Well, Dickens's famous opening lines, "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times," etc. do not come at the beginning of the production but are inserted into a monologue by Sydney Carton shortly after the start of the second DVD. Otherwise, the plot, details, and characters seem much the same as I remember from when I last read the book several years ago.My wife and I bought this set to help a young friend who is close to graduating from high school at a public school and therefore has problems with reading comprehension. We are well satisfied that she can watch this, then read, and perhaps profit in several ways.Anyone looking for dazzling FX and computer-generated panoramics will be disappointed. This was made on a budget for television in 1989.Otherwise, it is a capable -- sometimes very good -- and certainly a moving production. I think Dickens would have approved.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	0	1	Symantec has become toxic! I don't know what I am going to use this year, but it will have nothing to do with Norton or Symantec.I have used Norton products since the days of Peter Norton's Utilities for DOS 3.x. I have been a professional in the world of PC's and MAC's since before there were PC's or MAC's. I have recommended a lot of Symantec products over the years because a) they were better-behaved than some [notably McAfee], b) they offered more useful tools than most, and c) the different pieces worked well together -- which cannot always be said of installations built from several different vendors' products, even though each one might be superior to the comparable Symantec offering.That has all changed. The basic issue is that it is simply not possible -- without a high level of expertise -- to run security, backup, and optimization products without occasionally making use of the vendor's product support. Even with a high level of expertise, product support can be important.REALLY BAD PRODUCT SUPPORT WITH PRODUCTS LIKE NORTON UTILITIES, PERSONAL FIREWALL, ANTI-VIRUS, ETC. CAN BE HIGHLY TOXIC TO YOUR PC! FOR SEVERAL YEARS, SYMANTEC SUPPORT HAS BECOME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE FOLKS IN MUMBAI OR PESHAWAR OR WHEREVER THEY ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED FOR SYMANTEC SUPPORT ARE A VERY LONG WAY FROM BEING TOP DRAWER. THEY ARE A VERY LONG WAY FROM BEING ADEQUATE.THE ADVICE THAT YOU RECEIVE FROM THEM STANDS A DECENT CHANCE OF PERMANENTLY CRIPPLING YOUR PC, AND THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE FIRST CLUE HOW TO FIX ANY OF IT.STANDARD ANSWERS #1 - 10 FROM SYMANTEC SUPPORT ARE ALL THE SAME. REMOVE THEIR SOFTWARE USING THEIR REMOVAL TOOL, WHICH LEAVES BEHIND A MYRIAD OF DIRECTORY ENTRIES AND ODD FILES THAT THEY WILL USE TO RESTORE THE MESS THEY MADE IF YOU EVER UPGRADE ... AND THEN UPGRADE TO THEIR LATEST VERSION (SOUND OF CASH REGISTER HERE!)There is only one Norton/Symantec product that I will continue to use ... Norton Ghost ... and that in an older version for as long as I can.Why? Restoring a system hard drive to a known good condition via Norton Ghost is the only 100% effective cure that I have ever found for a) software that botches its own installation, b) software that botches other programs when you install it, c) THE APPLICATION OF THE SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY SYMANTEC SUPPORT ... AS I RECENTLY DISCOVERED MYSELF.Even Norton Ghost, in order to be effective, requires some knowledge and planning. The average user who puts everything on one hard drive and does not back up user data separately or who does not know what user data is required in order to preserve e-mail, etc. will experience more difficulty.Man the lifeboats! Women and children first! The good ship Symantec seems to have hit an iceberg!
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	Although historians populate the cast of characters, "THE HISTORIAN" is -- I believe -- Vlad Tepes himself, plumbing history to savor both the triumphs and the depravity of the human soul -- a dichotomy which he himself exemplifies. The book's profoundest insight is that historians tend to succumb to this same obsession, as does each of the characters in the book.If you are looking for Indiana Jones, this is NOT the book. If you are an historian who recognizes a portrait of yourself and of your craft set against a dark and powerful legend (with seasonings of Bram Stoker), you will probably enjoy it.How different in kind is Vlad the Impaler from his Turkish foe? How different from you and me are the monks of the story who preserve him?Students of Mao or Stalin or Hitler or Napoleon or Robespierre or Cromwell or William the Conqueror will recognize the obsession with knowing, the fascination with understanding, and the sober realization that the victims of these looming characters were real people.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	0	0	I ordered two of these at the same time, one for myself and one for my wife. Neither has been satisfactory, each for its own reasons.The multi-function button on the first one was difficult to push and required too much pressure on the in-ear speaker, making the headset uncomfortable to use. Any background noise rendered voice commands completely inoperable -- not that they worked well even in a quiet room. Finally, after about 6 weeks of light use, it simply quit working ... period!The second one seemed to have none of the problems of the first, but one evening I forgot to remove it when visiting a family member. I put it into my pocket, sat down to eat dinner, and when I got up the speaker had just snapped off.Think I'll try something different this time.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	I read this book while on vacation at Colonial Williamsburg, Virgina. It would be hard to imagine a better atmosphere in which to consider it.The focus of the book is the conflicting world views of the patriarch, Landon Carter (whose plantation is in the Williamsburg area), his slaves, and his son. The book illuminates the cognitive disconnects and churning dissatisfactions that plagued Carter, his heirs, and their plantation slaves because of rigid social separation, institutionalized deceit, and the dissolution of personal and power relationships at the coming of the American Revolution.I generally dislike social histories -- however necessary they may be -- if only because they seem always to be selective, poorly documented, and subject to easy contradiction. This one -- perhaps because it is so concentrated on the microcosm of one Virginia family -- manages to come across as solid, scholarly, believable, and a pretty good story to boot.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	When so much uninteresting garbage is currently published on DVD, I find it hard to believe that this outstanding mini-series is not available.Romanticized? Sure, but for what it is, it is reasonably factually accurate (certainly moreso than the average), and makes a lively and interesting story. Washington the frontiersman, Washington and Sally Fairfax, Washington and Braddock, Washington and Martha's children, Washington the homebody, Washington the soldier, Washington struggling with the Continental Congress, Washington for whom the United States Presidency was specifically created. All of it is here in this series. The depiction of the speech to the officers at Newburgh in 1783 alone is worth more than a dozen simpleton "comedies" or FX movies!Again, where is the DVD?
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	As with most of the commentaries in the Tyndale series, this one serves very well for my purpose, which is the preparation of a weekly Bible study class for an audience that is not -- and has no need to be -- deeply involved in the arcane minutiae and frequent wild leaps of logic associated with "serious" textual criticism.The two epistles are well-set in their historical context, both in terms of the issues addressed and the order of their appearance among other New Testament works.Linguistic analysis of the Greek text is competent and helpful without being overbearing. (I always study with two Greek texts open, but it is still nice to have somebody point out points of special significance.)I strongly recommend this book for the purpose that I have described or simply for someone who wants to study the epistles to the Thessalonians with greater insight than that provided by many other commentaries but without having to wade through the "airs above the ground" executed by too many critical scholars.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	I ran across this book in an ICU waiting room at Children's Hospital, Boston.I flipped idly through it because the cover art was attractive, and the whole theme stood in stark contrast to to the poorly drawn and politically correct pablum that consumed most of the shelf.Although I paged through the whole book, I knew within the first few pages, that I had to have this for my grandson!I am sure that there was a time when work like this seemed ordinary and of no special note (though Robert Louis Stevenson seems always to wear well), and we are fortunate that some of these things survive.Here you will find nothing blaring at the senses, nothing preaching politics to a child, and nothing trendy or polluted with technology for the sake of sensory overstimulation. Here is simple insight into the life of a child, filled with wonder at the extraordinary beauty of ordinary things and happenings. It is a life that I had, that my daughters had, and that I am determined my grandchildren will have, as well.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	BASED on a true story. The key word is "BASED."Not quite a historically accurate portrayal of the real events surrounding the lions of Tsavo, but one whale of a story and tightly suspenseful movie. In my opinion, it deserves to be considered a classic alongside such films as "High Noon" and "The Professionals."
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	It is a special thing to have available a product for children that does not involve any of the following: egregious violence, potty humor, moral vacuity, visual and auditory over-stimulation, deeply bizarre animated characters, empty political correctness, or tacit approval of boorish behavior.Since the original was not in a wide-screen format, neither is the DVD/Blu-Ray. This may be astonishing to some.My grandson loves this, though his favorites are "Cars" and "Ichabod and Mr. Toad." (I enjoy watching it with him.)
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	0	To begin with a caveat, I strongly recommend reading both of D'Souza's books on this subject, along with both of Barack Obama's autobiographies and a sampling of the writers that Obama flatly states helped form his world-view.I long ago figured out -- at the time of the return of the Churchill bust -- from reading "Dreams From My Father" and "The Audacity of Hope" that Obama defines himself more on the basis of his personal understanding of his Luo, Kenyan heritage than anybody who has not read those books or who has read them uncritically can imagine. I also realized that this identification was powerful enough to direct Obama's attitudes toward the United States and to prompt a certain amount of interference in Kenyan politics (like sending Joe Biden to campaign for Odinga's Shari'ah-friendly constitution) but definitely NOT strong enough to move Obama to any personal expenditure of either self or money on his family connections there.D'Souza, with his extensive knowledge and research has done an outstanding job of exposing, in the words of the title of his first work on this subject, "The Roots of Obama's Rage."This is a thoughtful, careful presentation that deserves very serious consideration in the process of trying to understand this otherwise engimatic radical in the White House.
A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	1	1	I am old enough to have seen this movie when it was first released. It has been a favorite of mine ever since.To call it a classic is not enough.Fabulous action. Fabulous dialogue. Strong messaging.And the acting? The title says it. Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Claudia Cardinale, Jack Palance, Woody Strode, Robert Ryan. These people were forces of nature as well as consummate professionals.
A1EVRJN96UVM4A	0	0	Some years back, movies entered the anti-hero era. the heroes became less defined, less pure. This movie may be trying to go one better on that one. It may be an attempt to begin the anti movie era. The acting, writing, lighting, etc. are just plum awful. One favorite moment is where the lead vampire says "I could have been a great actor." There is a dramatic pause afterward where I was wanting somebody, anybody to ask him: "So what happened?" I can't imagine who might like this movie...I really can't. If you go ahead and buy it anyway, don't say I didn't warn you.
A1EVRJN96UVM4A	1	1	I have just recieved this. I have seen an original 1611 KJV and I have to say that although it is not a perfect copy it comes very close. There is of course the obligatory copywrite page, an expected departure from the original. Of course there are details of construction which are present. The appearance/texture of the printing itself is a little bit different. If you want to get a modern copy which duplicates the sheer magnitude of the original. This is it. The original content is here, as is the gothic type set. Originals are available- for very high prices but with an original you have a fairly rare, fragile historic item. If you want something you can actually read, the replica is the way to go.

From beginners to experts even reading one section/chapter will leave you inspired and wanting more [don't you just hate it when they do that :-) ].View Amazon's "LOOK INSIDE" feature for more specific information, especially the Table of Contents.Be aware that Websites and specific accessories/materials mentioned in the book may have changed or no longer be available; "....the price of progress."Amazon will appreciate my noting that it was delivered quickly and in good order. Which is true for the vast majority of purchases (Okay Amazon, do I get my $50.00 now? ...for those who don't get it - I'm joking about the $50.00).This is the type of book that you read and want to re-read; it hardly ever gets old.
A1EWEOOWIIOVBC	1	1	Since music has so many personal preferences to it, touting that everyone will like him is unwise. However, if you even remotely like the sound of a 12 string guitar you will find something of interest by Dominic Gaudious.His website (...dominicgaudious'dot'com) has free download samples and links to videos. Additionally, YouTube has several videos of him in action.Not many people have the talent to play a custom guitar and DIDGERIDOO at the same time. Don't know what a DIDGERIDOO is? You've heard one - if, you have watched any of the "Crocodile Dundee" movies. Go to his Internet site for more information.
A1EWEOOWIIOVBC	1	1	After quite a bit of research this lathe was selected as having the most for its price (more bang for the buck). There are probably better deals available but, they are rare and difficult to find. Lathe machining is truly one of those areas that you get what you put into it.My original intended use for this lathe was for making 1:35th to 1:700th scale model parts and associated tools. For such use the lathe is a bit over-sized. Even used smaller lathes are, generally, much more expensive. The biggest drawback(s) is/are the lathe is not very ready to run "out of the box" and to make the lathe fit your particular use several 'accessories' need to be purchased. Purchasing lathe 'accessories'(machinist jargon: tooling) can cost as much, or more likely, more than the original lathe. Thus, for budget considerations plan on at least doubling the price of a lathe for tooling. As an example plan on spending, at least, $800.00 if you find this lathe on sale for $400.00.Some reviewers, found on the internet (search for: 7x10 or 7x12 mini-lathe), have stated that this lathe comes boxed as a kit. For most common purposes they are correct. Quite a bit of time and effort go into dis-assembling, cleaning, reassembling, and properly adjusting the lathe before it is ready to make anything (machinist jargon: make chips). There are also several modifications that may need to be made for general and custom purposes; it's an individual choice. There are very few step by step instructions available for making parts in a lathe. The bottom line is a lot of time and brain power is necessary before any part gets made.To sum things up, purchasing this lathe one day and making useful parts the next day is not likely to happen. Having a very clear idea in mind of what your goal is or what specific parts are to be made will save time and money. Also, if you are willing to do a lot of reading, research, planning, and practice getting your hands dirty in addition to making a number of mistakes, this is an ideal lathe to start with. The only way to cut down on time and expense would be to have a machinist willing to teach you...
A1EWEOOWIIOVBC	0	1	This Book was required reading and regurgitation for a university Geology course taken in 1974. Most of its doomsday like predictions have proven to be false. Part of the Scientific Method requires either discarding or seriously modifying a hypothesis in the face of contrary facts. There are the glaring facts that natural resources such as copper, gold, nickel, oil, zinc, etc., etc., were supposed to have been depleted by the year 2000 -- according to the authors and their "world model." These commodities, as of 2010 reports are not depleted. New sources are continuing to be discovered as have happened through-out human history.Thus, the hypothesis model is wrong, the input data is wildly inaccurate, and/or serious computer programing glitches/bugs are lurking about. There is a valid under-current or basic message, associated with the title however.That message is that business as usual - disregard for various side effects, including enviornmental, can not continue. There is a balance between shrub hugging, tree cuddling, bunny sniffers and myopic, bottom-line-profit, corporate morons. The mentality and methods of these extremes do more harm than good; there is ample historical evidence to illustrate the reality.A better use of time and resources, that went into this book, would have been addressing and hypothesizing towards a very important goal:Providing clean adequate drinking water and apt waste removal to EVERYONE on the planet. It would be a mighty first step to raising and equalizing living conditions...
A1EWEOOWIIOVBC	1	1	Another rich source of experience and knowledge for all Machinists.Pros - Very easy and pleasurable reading. Lots of good hints, tips, and drawings for projects plus, several lifetimes worth of knowledge available. Examples: "....how to find out almost anything..." - applies to much more than machining/metal work; "Fixture for setting the Compound Rest for taper turning"; "Shop made" taps, reamers, etc., etc. There are way too many other examples than can be covered here - the Table of Contents alone are 3 large pages long.Cons - Rather Pricey due mainly to small/independent publishing (Laws of Supply & Demand also show this is a quality product at a higher than average cost).Too many "plugs" or "teasers" for other products the author sells; there are many of us amateurs on highly limited budgets.No Index. It must be purchased separately, which covers all 3 volumes in the series. Because there is no Index, retrieving/applying the information can become a royal pain in the posterior.Conclusion - Imperfections aside/easily ignored, this and the previous two volumes are great books to have [must have?]. Several small spending sacrifices made in other areas will be amply rewarded in obtaining this book.
A1EWH82X8HFVT6	0	0	These cheap greedy individuals that make a blu ray movie in unison with the regular dvd. I knew it was to good to be true to see a blu ray combo from them. Part 1 and part 2 were cheap on making a blu ray combo. This movie is not worth 17.00 in which i paid. 9.49 and thats it. Not to mention, this movie was sort of boring. The actors need to attend acting school to better there skills. They suck!
A1EWH82X8HFVT6	1	1	If you like that "Kill Bill" type movie, then you'll like this. This is A very Kool Movie. I have two Copies just in case one breaks. My Kids love it too...
A1EWH82X8HFVT6	1	1	Not sure why it has such a low star rating but this was a good movie. Really a 4 star movie but since it has such a low star rating, thought I try to bring it up.
A1EWH82X8HFVT6	1	1	The acting could of been a little better but overall the movie was pretty good. If they had more scary parts that made you jump on some scenes, I would of like this even more.
A1EWKYGILWQ5P1	1	1	First of all, let me say what a big help this was to me. It pratically has sections on everything you need to know about ferrets; getting your house ferret-proof, how to bathe them, how to tell if they have an illness, and much more. This book is great for ferret owners and soon-to-be ferret owners. It is a must-have, and I highly recommend you buy it. Trust me, this is bool very helpful.
A1EWKYGILWQ5P1	1	1	First of all, let me say I have yet to read the book. All this proves is one can enjoy the movie without reading the book as one who has read the book. The Stand is one of the only King adaptions that didnt bomb, It being the other. The acting was truly rich, and you felt for the characters.But one person stood out.One person stole the scene every time she was on.One person truly made an already great movie a pure masterpiece.Laura San Giacomo.She played Nadine Cross, a bitchy yet lovable character who pratically radiated on the screen. If you buy this video, keep your eves peeled for her. Her talent is endless as she fits perfectly in her role, satisfying every scene she's in. Her last scene is a touching one as she stands up to Flagg and has the last laugh.The cast was excellent, but Laura stood out of the crowd. I highly recommend you buy this video, and 5 stars isn't even half what this movie deserves.
A1EWKYGILWQ5P1	0	0	This book is awful. First of all, major errors galore.One example: THE STAND.They say Harold Lauder went to Las Vegas... no. Last time I checked, he lost control of his motorcycle (courtesy of Flagg) and went down a hill, where he broke several bones and later commited suicide.They also wrote down Nadine Cross, as a sad, poor character. They forgot to mention she planted the bomb (they only say Harold did the deed.)They do profiles on minor characters (Ace High; this character is mentioned, like 8 times at the highest in the book. He does nothing) yet exclude characters such as Dayna Jurgens (she was one of the three spies sent to Las Vegas; a MAJOR part of the book)Also, someone wrote a review saying how he liked the book said that King is writing a meganovel finale that ties up all his previous works. (basically, assorted villians from King's works team up and assorted heroes from King's works team up, and the two groups fight.) Besides sounding so cheesy it belongs in something like Power Rangers, they mention characters from both sides which can't fight; they're dead!They spoil the plot in pratically each book (probably ruining it for new readers who checked it out to see which books are good).Want to read a good book? The Stephen King Compendium. No spoilers, yet sufficient info, good quotes, no false info, no errors...just don't waste your money on this...
A1EX2VKRAXMA3T	1	1	This was a super album that's unfortunatly hard to find now. The songs were the sort of speed thrash metal you found in the late 80's early 90's (almost like D.R.I. but mixed with something a little more metal) There's a song, it was either the last song on the first side of the tape or first song on the second side of the tape that was just classical guitar instrumental. Almost like Spanish guitar mixed with metal. it's on of the most astounding pieces of guitar metal work I've heard. very beautiful.
A1EXGZN6GKWYW1	0	0	It is too difficult to install and use I am returning it in the box it came in Ellen Levitt
A1EXGZN6GKWYW1	1	1	I am mostly pleased with this product. would definitely recommend to any one who asks me about it. Ellen Levitt
A1EXLYO2W3Y5CM	1	1	This book is very touching and has a beautiful ending. Barry, the main character, who cares so much for this girl, that he risked his life just to keep her alive from the sink of the Titanic. I won't spoil your reading, but if u feel like reading, I guarantee u will like this one.
A1EXLYO2W3Y5CM	1	1	The best Backstreet Boys' book ever for their special fans. Many great pictures that have never been seen by most people. They also have some words describing the pictures. The book is very funny and cute. A must have for any Backstreet fan.
A1EXLYO2W3Y5CM	1	1	This is an album u can listen to until it's worn out. The songs are good with catchy tunes and beautiful lyrics.1. &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; is devoted to all their fans. Great lyrics that explain how much they love their fans. 5 out of 52. &quot;I Want it That Way&quot; is an all-time classic. Don't believe me? Well, Rolling Stone, MTV, and Billboard thinks so. I love this song, I would say it is my favorite, but I have about 10 favorites that I can't pick my #1. 5 out of 53. &quot;Show Me the Meaning&quot; is a song of what they have went through in their lives. If u listen to it closely, u can actually feel their sadness. It's the most mature song on the album. 5 out of 54. &quot;It's Gotta Be You&quot; has a great bounce to it that makes you go crazy. Another one of my favorites. 5 out of 5.5. &quot;I Need You Tonight&quot; is a great ballad with music that's unplugged. The song is a solo by Nick Carter. Lyrics aren't repeating, which is some thing new in pop music. (Nsync, are u taking notes? ) 5 out of 56. &quot;Don't Want U Back&quot; is an R and B kind of sound which for some reason, I don't like very much. 3 out of 57. &quot;Don't Wanna Lose You Now&quot; is a soft ballad that says they will do anything just to get that special girl back. It makes u feel like there are still guys out there that really care. 5 out of 58. &quot;The One&quot; has a great beat to it, but.....not on my top ten list! 4 out of 59. &quot;Back to Your Heart&quot; what a great song! Co-Wrote by Kevin Richardson, it's a really soft song with beautiful keyboard music. Kevin, wherever you are, GREAT JOB! 10 out of 510. &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; shows the influence and background of some of the members of the BSB. (Howie and AJ to be exact) 5 out of 511. &quot;No One Else Comes Close&quot; Great song very nice and mature. 5 out of 512. &quot;Perfect Fan&quot; It is such a sweet song. Dedicated to their moms. In concert in Kentucky, u can see Kevin and Brian with their moms. 5 out of 5
A1EXLYO2W3Y5CM	1	1	Great book with a science fantasy look that makes your spinetingle when you read it, and don't know what's going to happen next. I love the Land of Narnia because it is like a wonderland where animals can talk and trees are alive.... I don't want to spoil your reading, so I'll stop here. ENJOY READING IT! END
A1EXLYO2W3Y5CM	1	1	I am a 12 year old that is in algebra math. He describes and teaches well in his text, which makes you not even need a teacher. I learned algebra without anybody helping me, and I passed the SAT test with flying colors. Thanks Saxon!!
A1EXORCB8PK76J	1	1	best album ever. listen to it all the time. its...... better than good... its real good
A1EXORCB8PK76J	1	1	Wow. An awsome sequal to Burnout 3. This is one of my all time favorite raceing games.Pros:Blowing up your rivals when they take you out.Plowing threw trafic and nailing your rivals from behind with a taxi.Beautifull tracksAwsome graphics.Cons:The music 5uck5, turn it off.Camera gets shakey when boosting.The new launch bar in crash mode is stupid, getting a fast launch is next to impossible.The cheering in crash mode can get on your nerves.All and all an awsome game for anyone into raceing. get this game now.
A1EXORCB8PK76J	0	0	Ok, so they have a dvd with videos of all there greatest hits, woopide fricken do.......... WHY THE HELL DON"T THEY HAVE A GREATEST HITS ALBUM!!!???????? Thats reeeaaallllyyyy lame! As a huge fan I must say I'm quite agrivated by that! Theres no excuse for a band with that many hits to not have one, am I right?!
A1EXRRSUIQYKXM	0	1	Its a five star movie with a one star marketing scheme. I have both the original theatrical releases and the extended version. Trust me when I say I havent cracked open the originals since I bought the extended ones. Its not like they need the money. What happened to the first billion they made. Im waiting patiently.
A1EXRRSUIQYKXM	1	1	Kiss-ass isnt perfect and it isnt for everyone. It's rated R for good reason. That being said it pushes escapism to new levels and renders a comic book as close to the source material as u may ever see. The movie, like most based on comic books is a story of good versus evil. Evil here in the form of mob boss Frank D'Amico, played well by Mark Strong who seems to have claimed the niche Gary Oldman once held as bad guy of choice. The good rests in two camps. Dave, a hapless teen who becomes Kick-ass because he believes in a world where super heroes help people, and a pair of vigilantes named Big Daddy and Hit-girl. Dave, whose efforts to help usually end up in him getting beat up and the vigilante paths cross while Dave is doing a favor for the girl of his dreams.The movie features the usual funny school friends and the heroes quest for the love of a girl that he cant have. What makes this movie special is its hero. Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are well trained and well armed killing machines. Big Daddy is so bent on vengeance he has stolen her childhood of his daughter and turned her into a tiny terminator. They have the power, the resources and the skill. Dave has nothing like that. Dave cares. Dave tries and fails and keeps trying. He isnt a comic book hero like the other two. Dave's a real hero like a soldier or a cop on the street. He helps despite his lack of power because its the right thing to do.Aaron Johnson is perfect as Dave and eleven year old Chloe Moretz (Hit-Girl)is headed for long, star studded career. If u want to appreciate how good the young girl is turn the sound off and just watch her. Her facial expressions, the way she carries herself convey her character as well as her lines do. The score perfectly mirrors the action as if the actors had performed to the music.
A1EYEKWOBJQ810	1	1	I cant speak to the old model. The model I have is the newer one apparently.I dont jog or ski with it on. SKI??? Anyway if you are a jogger perhaps you should get one of the small cheaper ones made just for sports use. This is more of a big one for holding TONS of music and transporting/listening to it say from home to work and in the car inbetween.It seems sturdy, good software, nice features good price compared to the Ipod which is 100 more right now.I havnt had it long enough to say if it will last but I will come back and edit this if I have problems.
A1EYEKWOBJQ810	1	1	I enjoyed this book it made me laugh in several places. It wasnt the BEST book ever read but it was worth reading for sure.
A1EYEKWOBJQ810	1	1	This is my second Hoover carpet cleaner. The last one kept going for 9 years. The attachment hose finally dry rotted and it tore. The motor was still going strong though. I decided it was time to let 'er go and get a new one. I read all the reviews here on every machine and knew I had to get another Hoover. A friend has the Bissell and I have used it at her house to clean up after her pets while sitting for them. It leaks and has a terrible way of storing the clean water in with the dirty water which is just gross. Its sort of in a bladder. Yuck. I love the way this new machine has the two tanks right on the sides of the machine. They are easier to fill than the old one I am replacing and easier to see the fluid levels in them. I cleaned my living room today and went over the whole thing twice so far. Its in really bad shape because I havnt cleaned the rug in about 8 months and I have 3 kids and 2 dogs and 2 cats. Needless to say it needed cleaning. It pulled so much grime out I couldnt believe it. It also really did a great job on spots and stains. It litterally took one pass to get a dog accident stain remnant up. I had used some spray carpet cleaner at the time of the accident and blotted but there was still a stain... so I was happy that it got everything out. It was easy to set up and easy to use~ Great buy.
A1EYEKWOBJQ810	1	1	Great little feeder. Excellent. If you ever have any problems with this feeder the company will take care of it.
A1EYEKWOBJQ810	1	1	These boots replaced my Titan Pro boots and for the first time in a long time my feet do not hurt! They are cute too and do not look like a man's boot on a woman. The leather is nice the boot needs no break in time and they are pretty light as well. Two things I wish were different on these, I like the quick lace hooks on boots these take a little longer to get on and off and the back of the boot is low on the ankle. I love my boots to cover and protect the achillies area as I tend to hit that area on my decent down steep ladder and stair ways. Other than that every aspect of these will get 5 stars from me.
A1EYQN92P8T99I	0	1	I'm not rating the film but, the blu-ray disc...the film is 5 stars!I just purchased a blu-ray player and am upgrading my library...A perfect example of a good flick getting a bad, bad disc...sound and picture quality is poor.There was a warning on the disc before the film started that the transfer from from inferior source material.wish I had known this before I purchased the disc, it does not look much better than the DVD I own.I just had it in my mind to expect more from blu-ray...go figure.
A1EYQN92P8T99I	1	1	Great film & awesome blu-ray picture and sound.Just bought a blu-ray player and this was the first film I watched in glorious 1080p.Why did I wait this long to make the BR plunge?
A1EZM7JVCAMZV2	1	1	This is a very good sound card. You can have a real sound improvement with this card on your device. However you must be patience with it. Not very easy for switching from headset to speakers and vice versa also it increase its temperature a lot during regular use. I love this card but you must get used to it.
A1EZM7JVCAMZV2	1	1	I have this new conroe proc instead of my regular AMD processor. It was hard the change from AMD to intel since I am a gamer. However going thru a lot of review I decided to change. Now I am happy with the change and this proc rules.It has good performance and low power consumption. If you are not sure on changing from AMD to intel I can tell you that you do not have to worry about it. This is not the extreme edition but along with me Nvidia 7900 GTX it runs smooth all games. You can try it.
A1EZM7JVCAMZV2	1	1	This is a comfortable and fair device for gamer and it has also a fair price.
A1EZM7JVCAMZV2	0	0	I did not receive what it was described. The seller never responded and the DVD was just a cheap copy with no booklet package or anything. Do not buy it.
A1EZZQ61AAXYCU	1	1	It has always been a mystery to me as to the reasons behind the fashionable distaste for the musical version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." I've never been able to solve the mystery, but it is merely fashionability. The score is one of the most beautiful ever written -- I've listened to it across the span of my entire life from the time it was released in 1969 and have yet to find it anything but extraordinary. The film is a moving depiction of what love is really about and never fails to move me. The performances by both Peter O'Toole (why has Hollywood thought it useful to cheat this great actor of his due with a "real" Oscar -- sheer jealousy?) and Petula Clark are extraordinary. Yet, a strange, and, to me, bizarre cult of disparagement has risen about this film. Don't be fooled by fools who wish to belittle real talent. This is one of the all-time great musicals. Don't miss it.
A1EZZQ61AAXYCU	1	1	I had the good fortune of actually seeing this production of "Guys and Dolls" and it was -- as this recording demonstrates -- flawless in its execution, and it remains the best version of "Guys and Dolls" ever produced. This album is a timeless presentation of Frank Loesser's music that is always fresh -- and often both hilarious and deeply moving. I am a scholar in the field of the Broadway Musical, and I have, quite frankly, rarely in my life seen a show this good. It was so good that I contacted the producer to try and get it saved on video on PBS, but they did not have the TV rights, which was tragic. Don't miss this cast recording. Every song is a demonstration of true excellence.
A1F027JH5KCF85	1	1	I'd tried other yoga DVDs, but never got the "rush" or "glow" that everyone talked about. I never understood what was so great about Yoga. Then I bought Ana and Ravi's Beginners & Beyond. I must say that I was blown away. As a fitness novice, I was easily able to do the first set. I could feel it in my abs the next day, though. I'm slowly building strength and doing more and more of the second set. I always feel rejuvenated after doing this DVD. It is well worth the money. In fact, I just ordered my second of Ana and Ravi's. I can't wait until their 2 news ones come out next month.Sat Nam
A1F027JH5KCF85	1	1	I give this DVD 5 stars. That said, I can see how other might not feel challenged enough by it. I'm a beginner and not in the greatest shape. This video was challenging for me, yet easiest enough that I could make it all the way through. Sara does give variations a few times for the more advanced yogi. I did break a small sweat and felt refreshed afterwards. I'll continue to do this DVD and recommend it to other beginner/intermediates. It's great when you're crunched for time.
A1F027JH5KCF85	0	0	After the author told me to withhold affection when my child misbehaved, I lost interest and faith in where this book was going. This just wasn't for us.
A1F027JH5KCF85	1	1	Amy Dixon does a great job of leading a workout that is interesting, challenging, and accessible to beginners. I followed the modifications for nearly all of the last cardio set, and still felt challenged. Thanks for making a video that didn't make this 20-something feel like a granny (No offense granny).
A1F04HCZ7SZEHW	0	0	Like so many movies of this genre, most of the film was spent chasing clue after clue from church to church, and it's been done better by others. It is my opinion this film would have been just as good, if not better, were it to have sent the protagonists directly to the ending location and spent the rest of the time focusing in on the antagonists' plotting. As it stood, the first parts of the film were unnecessarily confusing, and some clarification before the denoument would have been appreciated.But if you can fast forward through all the gratuitous gore and computer-generated-pentacles-superimposed-on-Earth scenes, the ending isn't at all bad: the secret of the Loculus was an interesting surprise, the one sex-scene was more erotic than sleazy (and for once, essential to the plot), and the final ending rather disturbing, in a thought-provoking sort of way.All in all, not a total waste of time, but not exactly a film one would wish to re-watch in its entirety.
A1F04HCZ7SZEHW	0	0	...because that's just about what it's worth.I don't think I've ever seen a *duller* vampire picture in my life. The acting was so stilted that the lead vampire wasn't so much undead as just dead boring, most of the rest of the characters looked as if they were reading their lines from cue cards, and the best I can say for the gore was that I wanted to ask the vamps to brush their fangs after eating.This was just the first third of the movie. I stopped watching after that--I didn't even bother keeping it on for background noise.But, hey, at least the case can be reused.

A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I tried several other kinds of credit card sized magnifiers but they all cracked within a week or two. The stiffer plastic just couldn't hold up when placed in a billfold. The Bausch & Lomb version is extremely flexible so it bends, without breaking, when used in my billfold. The other versions had a round "spot" magnifier for extremely small print, which was nice, but I can live without that.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	We purchased this unit and got high readings so we contacted a radon test company. They ran their test and the numbers came in right on the button with our Safety Siren Pro Series 3. Mitigation was done and a follow up test was performed by the testing company. (Testing and mitigation were done by two separate companies to avoid any conflicts) Now our always-on Safety Siren Detector provides a consistent way to visually check the current readings and also will provide an audible warning if the levels ever get too high again. Our mitigation system has only a visual method of checking operation and it's nice to have the audible backup of the Safety Siren.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	0	1	This is a tempermental piece of equipment. If (and that's IF) you get it to hold the cable connector you need to be very careful if you move the unit it is attached to. It will easily drop off and it's a challenge to connect it again. Very disappointing.

A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	0	This product worked for me. It fit and installed easily. I ordered online from Lowes and had it delivered to my local store. Based on another review here, if I wanted to return it, I knew Lowes would handle it with no problem.I did have one concern about keeping the insulation rating up in our attic. I wrote the manufacturer and received the reply below:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The R factor for insulation is approximately 3.5 per 1 inch of thickness. In order to have an R factor of 38, recommended for attics, the depth of the insulation needs to be 10 to 12 inches. If you install Attic Dek on top of the ceiling joists do not compress the insulation. The insulation should be loose. Attic Dek is recommended for use over garages or other unheated space. If used over living space one could place poly encased fiber glassbatting over the Attic Dek panels when not in use.Carole KrolMetro Products
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I've had other root feeders and they simply didn't hold up. For those and the Yard Butler, I've first hammered a section of rebar into the ground to make a hole. This seems to extend the life of the feeder quite a bit. My Yard Butler was "plugged up" when it arrived but I used a nail to push the blockage back into the tube and then used water to reverse flush it out. Worked fine after that. The big drawback to this feeder is the fact it doesn't have a built-in fertilizer system. I ended up buying a Hozon Brass Siphon Mixer (which is listed here on Amazon) and I liked the way it worked. You mix a big bucket of whatever you are going to use and then put the siphon in the bucket, turn on the water and come back later. My other feeders would run 5 or 10 minutes before needing to be reloaded with pellets. I left the Hozon/Yard Butler running for an hour.Hint: If you turn the water on before putting the Yard Butler into the ground it will help keep it from clogging.I would buy the Yard Butler again.See my review on the Hozon Brass Siphon Mixer for the negatives on that unit.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	0	I use this with a Yard Butler Deep Root Irrigator (available on Amazon). My prior root feeders had an attached system for the fertilizer pellets but the Yard Butler did not. This unit does have a built-in backflow valve and I didn't need that, but I've wondered if it might have been part of the challenge I had in getting this to work. The instructions say to put the tube in a bucket and turn the water on full blast. I did this but it didn't work. I finally removed the spring end piece (used for weight and, I assume, some filtering) and noticed if I held my finger on the tube and turned the water on fully there was a surge of suction, then nothing. Then I discovered if I turned the water on slowly until I felt the suction and stopped at that point it continued to pull mixture from the bucket. Again, if I turned the water on fully it did not work.The nice thing is, where you need to replace "pellets" in other feeders after 5 or 10 minutes, this system ran for an hour before it used up the entire 2 gallon mixture.The threads are very sharp on this nicely machined piece of brass so watch your fingers.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	0	0	Two of these bits broke on the 1st or 2nd use. I was drilling kitchen cabinets for a screw hole so it was not heavy duty use. The "break" did not occur on the drill bit itself, but where the drill bit fits into the hex shaft. The bits are actually two pieces, a regular drill bit which is pressed/inserted into a hex shaft. Since it was exposed, I was able to see that the drill bit shaft had a flattened area that apparently is supposed to be held by another flat area inside the hex shaft. I was able to reinsert the drill bit back into the hex shaft and turn it freely by hand. Whatever was supposed to "catch" and keep the bit from spinning was obviously long gone. Hopefully I just had a bad batch. Amazon is replacing them and I'll see how they do. Knowing what I know now, I'd probably opt for a one piece hex drill bit, rather than what turned out to be a two piece setup.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I was after a minimalist hose reel that had some strength and rigidity to it. The local discount stores carry a version of this brand name that is flimsy (in my opinion) and doesn't look like it will last. The weak link in this version is probably the support system for the reel. I don't use that though. I wanted something I could put hoses on and bring them in the basement. This works fine for that. I've actually been laying the hose out on the ground and then rolling the reel over it to load it on. This eliminates the need for the support spindle and won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it really does make for very compact hose storage.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	Like a watch being wound continuously for 40 years, Tower of Power just keeps getting tighter and tighter. It is a great pleasure to see these fellows playing and really enjoying their music after all these years. My litmus test for purchases like this is a simple, "Would I buy it again?" and the answer is definitely "Yes." Should you buy it? Of course, but only if you if feel like you gotta funkifize...
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I just watched the DVD Making Of Burning For Buddy: A Tribute To Buddy Rich. A lot of highly respected drummers came to play and pay homage to Buddy. I knew Buddy was a great drummer but their insight on this DVD added even more to my appreciation for his talents. Watching this program caused me to dig out my copy of Big Swing Face and revisit it. The music is simply amazing. The band is on fire and Buddy is cooking! He always gave 110% and it came through on these recordings. After you listen to the CD, make sure you track down some of the online video clips and watch this guy in action. The sound on the CD is amazing, but actually seeing what he does with a drum set is unbelievable.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	The product is a gel. It applies rather thickly and then dries to a nonslick surface. It's impossible to keep everything from sticking to a car, but I would say this eliminated 90 to 95% of our bug removal problems. It rinsed right off in our local self-service "wand" car wash. It was on the car for three full days even though the instructions say to remove it within 24 hours for best results. I've posted a copy of the label with instruction under the pictures section here.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I ordered both and have posted my pictures for reference above. The PikStik has a larger capacity to pick up items, as you can tell from the photo. It is slightly shorter than the Ettore. Both have heads that rotate. The pickup part is configured differently on each one. The PikStik is more of a "flat" system, like keeping your hands straight and clapping. The Ettore has a bit more of an edge that is more like cupping your hands slightly and clapping. It seemed to me the Ettore picked up a coin lying flat on a table just a little more easily than the PikStik, but both performed the same when the coin was on a carpet. If you need the larger capacity, then the PikStik is your choice. If you need the extra two inch reach, then the Ettore 50 inch is your choice. If neither of those is a factor, you can choose whichever looks best to you or is least expensive at the time of your purchase. You'll be happy with either one.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	My original of this saw was wearing down and I felt an upgrade was in order, so I bought a really nice wood saw. It was so nice I didn't want to use it on some of my "junk" cutting, such as plastic, roots in the ground, etc. So, I broke down and bought this Stanley saw again and I'm really glad to have it back in my tool kit. It is great for those cuts which need a decent saw, but don't need an artisan saw.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	Since we were after a smaller size, this worked fine for us. The instruction manual shows 5" x 19" which is the size as I measured it. With the cover on, the width is 6 1/4 inches. Not sure why Amazon shows it as 7" wide. Nice timer and temperature controls. Works as expected.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	I purchased this from Amazon on March 22, 2007 for $89.99. At this point (10/18/12) the pricing has increased dramatically. Apparently Amazon is not carrying it in their own stock and outside vendors are supplying it. Seems strange that pricing on a gizmo like this would increase so much in five years... Today it is listed for $148.50. It must be a collector's item now.The unit works well. It's a little wasteful of the tape, as others have pointed out, but the printing is nice and compared to the old embossed labelers of old, this is a deluxe upgrade. I would not buy it at $148.50, but at the price I paid it was a relatively good value.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	This is an inexpensive cord reel. For what it is, it's worked very well for us. I see reviews about "doubling" the wire to make it easier to reel, but I have good luck on smaller (thinner) cords where I just reel it straight in. These are 100 ft. cords. Thicker cords are problematic, probably because of the physics involved (a thicker cord takes up more space...). If they advertised it as a 100 ft. reel people would be surprised on the upside. Bottom line: Works great for our occasional use (20 times a year, or so). Would buy again. We also use them for Christmas lights and they are ok for that, but not designed specifically to handle the "bulb lumps," but for once a year I can handle that minor hassle.
A1F0ITW7KPUKQI	1	1	The first segment is a bit slow, but still worth watching. Things pick up then as Louie puts lessons learned into a nice drum solo. I was intrigued that during the "lesson" part, Murray was giving Louie a pattern to play and he couldn't do it! It took Louie several times to get it right - to his instructors satisfaction. It was nice to see that even the pros struggle with various concepts, when they are new to them.I also enjoyed the nice shots of Louie's left hand working. That's always been a challenge for me, so it was nice to see it explained in detail. I'm glad I picked this DVD up and will keep it in my permanent collection.

A1F0KPA232MTYC	0	0	Probably the worst chemistry book I have ever read. The book flirts between pure academic research (not a useful how to manual) and the issues with these drugs.If the writer has a chemistry degree he ought to renounce his degree.

A1F0KPA232MTYC	0	1	The idea of a huge box to fill your disks in is very appealing particularly for the price. But three problems. I have trouble zipping up the wallet. Also, the disks seem to keep falling out. Finally, the biggest issue is that this wallet as many others requires you to PUSH OUT the plastic for each and every disk slot. And some of the plastic remains until you keep pulling. My gosh why can't you just provide the pouches with no plastic-removal piece for those of us who have better things to do than spend time tearing out plastic on perforations which sometimes cause you to &#34;over tear&#34; the cut out.

A1F0KYEBK2019R	0	1	The title describes quite well just where the series has wandered. This movie seems to be nothing more than an ill attemptto keep the saga alive. Moreover I believe there is more footage of the original film in this monstrosity than anything new director Coscarelli has drempt up.There are aspects of the film that work well though. For instance the atmosphere is the creepiest since the Cocteauian original and realy sets an eery mood. Furthermore Coscarelli has scraped the idea of numerous sub-characters found in the prequels to establish a final showdown between the key players.However, the definitive Phantasm this is not. Those in hope of answers to the mythos of the pernicious Tall Man will be greeted with obscure answers that lead to yet more questions. One begins to wonder if Coscarelli is apprehensive to reveal too much in fear of diminishing Phantasm's mystque, or perhaps the director is just biding his time until(or if) the funding for Phantasm's End comes around.Whatever the reason this lackluster attempt to prolong the series will most likely fail to inspire even the most die hard of fans.
A1F0KYEBK2019R	1	1	Johnny and Barbra head through the country in route to the cemetery their departed father currently resides at. Though he may not remain dead much longer. George A. Romero's seminal cult classic starts off in a somber tone with an ominous title sequence culminating with his own credit superimposed opposite an American flag. Ostensibly we're witness to a mundane annual trip to the gravesite of a half remembered pops. Johnny and Barbra are siblings, and the former preys on the latter's fear of her surroundings. "They're coming to get you, Barbra!" he insists. It's all in jest of course. Johnny means her no harm. As they depart, Johnny notices an intoxicated looking man lumbering about and exclaims, "Look! There's one now!". As the odd man comes closer he indeed does attack Barbra, and thus begins one of the genres most appealing outings.Johnny is quick to assist in repelling Barb's attacker, engaging in a fists to cuffs with the gaunt creature. Johnny falls, cracks his head against stone granite, and lies prostate. Barbra's on her own. She decides to make a run for the car, and upon securing herself inside, realizes she hasn't the keys. Oh dear. The odd man isn't so lumbering that it takes him very long to reach Barbra in her steel prison, and soon he's bludgeoning the car's window with a brick. Our protagonist isn't catatonic quite yet however (though she occupies most her later screen time in this state), and she has sense enough to release the emergency break. As she coasts down the dirt road, the odd man staggers after her in a fevered pursuit. The car makes an impromptu stop at the base of a tree, and Barb makes another dash out in this evermore peculiar world. This time she makes it to a more fortified locale, a farmhouse.Once inside she makes an exploration of the premises. She discovers the phone is out and the owner(s) have a thing for taxidermy. Our heroine seems to be on the brink of a complete mental breakdown when Ben comes crashing in. Now about Ben, well, Ben's the man. He takes charge of the situation going immediately to work on further fortifying the farmhouse. He also relates to Barbra a rather strange occurrence concerning a group of men, not dissimilar to Barbra's pursuer, who were terrorizing people outside a diner. Barb's pretty out of it though, and begins to rave on about Johnny, and demands they go back to his rescue. Such a vehement frenzy she exudes that it behooves our hero Ben to smack her one for her own good.Later, they discover more people. There are the Coopers; Harry, Helen, and there young daughter who's received a nasty bite from one of the ghouls. Also a young couple; Tom and Judy. They've holed up down in the basement. When Ben asks Harry why he hadn't come up when he heard the screaming, he insists he was unsure if it was of any use. "For all we knew you could have been one of those things!", he exclaims. Tensions run high as Ben claims command of the upstairs and Harry the basement. Both men have good ideas, but refuse to work together. Ultimately, this lack of cohesiveness will lead to their doom.Night of the Living Dead, much like it's two sequels, isn't so much about the zombies as it is about the relationships between people forced to band together. The farmhouse bunch form a sort of micro colony, and the actions of one effect the well being of them all. It's also very much a product of it's time. Coming out in the same year that saw both the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy, and with the war raging on, the movie is certainly indicative of it`s time. It also owes a great deal to Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend", which also deals with society upheaval.Beyond that, and why it's truly so endearing, is it's great storytelling. The story unfolds slowly at first and then starts to rip along at a relentless pace. There are many scenes that induce audience participation. Rummaging the farmhouse for supplies, and waiting eagerly for the next T.V. or radio announcement. Then, contemplating the next move of action. The movie really has you becoming involved with the group. The horror elements are all there to, including one very grizzly scene involving a trowel. The films infamous final moments are indelible and certainly do much to solidify it's place in cinema history. Night of the Living Dead is really the beginning of a decade of genre classics. It's gorilla filmmaking style laid the tracks for such classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it reminds us of a time when horror films were about a little more than just making you jump from your seat.

Anyhow, after reading these reviews, I bought some and cannot stress enough to wait it out! Keep refilling the liquid if it gets low (and it just may if you have enough ants) and in about 48 hours the ants will dwindle and die. DO NOT KILL THEM WHILE THEY EAT- the borox will do the job. :) Super STUFF!
A1F0MK3MMG40O2	1	1	How awesome is this show? I remember wanting to watch it in high school, but I never seemed to catch it! My fiance brought this home- I laughed so hard at some of these episodes I almost peed! But, this is not all comedy; a lot of it reminds me of that stupid teenage angst we all felt at some point.I watched the whole series over a period of two days and managed to not shower the entire time while eating bowls of ice cream and cereal. Thanks a lot!
A1F0MK3MMG40O2	1	1	My dog zombie is a 24.5 lb terrier mix who loves him some cat food. In fact, four cats worth of food. We have tried everything to keep him away. We scolded him, threatened with the slipper, moved the food to an area where he wasn't supposed to go, all to no avail. Then I got the petsafe pawz away barrier. Like another reader I tested it on myself first and in my honest opinion its mild, but enough to provide a shock. Like a bad static electricity shock from a door knob. It was easy to set up- the hardest part was opening the package itself. (I hate those sharp plastic boxes). Three zaps later, and I don't even need the collar anymore! Even if I throw a toy against the cat bowls, he wont go near em (not wearing the collar mind you). Very happy with this product- just wish it were a little less expensive since I really only used it for a day and a half.
A1F0MK3MMG40O2	1	1	My dog loves these things. Hes a moderate chewer, so it takes him a few weeks to go through it, but I suggest you throw it away when it starts to get too small if you worry about the jagged edges. It doesn't seem to get moldy (thank goodness) but one major drawback is stepping on the darn thing barefoot! OUCH!
A1F0TPIVWI3F26	1	1	I only checked this book out from the library because the cover illustration included some dinosaur fossils (my son is always looking for new dino books), but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this story of a girl taking her grandmother on a visit to the Museum of Natural History.Molly is accustomed to going to "Interesting Places" with her grandmother, but after a school field trip to the Museum of Natural History, she is delighted to realize that at last, she has found an Interesting Place her grandmother has never visited. She offers to take Grandma to the Museum and takes charge, right down to reminding Grandma of the importance of comfortable shoes and using the bathroom before leaving the house.The illustrations are drawings incorporating photos of items on exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History (NY), which I thought was a nice touch. Molly and her grandmother visit many exhibits--dinosaurs, Africa, the Arctic, ocean life, rocks, bugs, human biology, the Ice Age--and their conversation about what they see presents many interesting facts without sounding too didactic.This might have a bit too much text for younger readers/listeners, but there are plenty of interesting pictures to look at. A fun read for both me and my 4 1/2 year old son.
A1F0TPIVWI3F26	1	1	Both my son and I really enjoy this rhyming Christmas/numbers book in which Octavia, a young reindeer, describes her seven uncles (from Uncle Uno to Uncle Sven). My personal favorite is Uncle Duce, an Elvis impersonator, while my son seems to prefer Uncle Quint, a basketball star.The rhythm and rhyme are perfect. Extra credit to the author for using the word "tines" in a book for youngsters ("Uncle Trey is short and wide. Antler tines? Three on each side!")...the vocabulary is just sophisticated enough to be slightly challenging to young readers.Brian Floca (for Click magazine readers, he's the illustrator of "Beatrice Black Bear") draws with a loose, Quentin Blake style. OK, maybe that doesn't help much. Let's just say his reindeer have personality...these are not cookie cutter reindeer. Floca's illustrations live up to the creativity of Lisa Wheeler's words; it takes a special artist to draw an Elvis reindeer, complete with wig and white jumpsuit.I'm kind of sorry I didn't discover this book until after the holiday season, but really, I think it's funny enough to keep us laughing all year `round.
A1F0TPIVWI3F26	1	1	Tired of nagging your child about manners? Get this adorable book for a little change of pace.Simply drawn, brightly colored illustrations show various animals with typical little kid table manners. (My favorite: "When an elephant drinks milk at mealtime, he should spray it all over the table. SPLAT! Is that right?") Turn the page to see and read the corresponding good manners. ("No, that's wrong. When an elephant drinks milk at mealtime, he should sip it quietly, a few gallons at a time. SSSSSIP!")This book makes an amusing read-aloud; in addition to the humor of both text and illustrations, your child can join in on the repeated "Is that right? No, that's wrong" following each example of rudeness. Only you know your children well enough to assess the probability that they will find the bad manners funnier and more memorable than the good! But after reading this book, you can remind them to wash their hooves before dinner or not to burp like giraffe.Now if only the creators of this book would make a revised edition including slouching at the dinner table....

A1F17G9Y3BF3VJ	0	1	I still haven't finished reading this a year later.since finding out the author made up most of it, or all of it.she's some housewife in New Jersey, which takes my interest away.If it were a true-life account of a kids life I'd have already read the whole book.The movie was pretty good though.

A1F1EXCRQ2XTYW	1	1	I am just listening to it now, and it is understandable why Number of the Beast is such a great album.1981 was a interesting year for Maiden, at the end of the Killers tour singer Paul Di'Anno (a great vocalist in his own right) was kicked out of the group for his partying ways. After a few tryouts they ended up with Samson's Bruce Bruce (Dickinson) bringing us to the line up of Steve Harris (Bass), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Clive Burr (drums) and Dickinson.Now, I don't want to get into the debate over who's better, Di'Anno or Dickinson, but listening to this it's hard to imagine the short haired punk fan singing some of the notes in 22 Acacia Avenue or the title track. So anyway, to the album.the first thing that grabs you is the artwork, the classic Eddie-Devil-Eddie puppetry. Now, being from a christian family and being christian myself, this album didn't go down too well (i can still remember my mother's face when she first saw it). But, having listened to the interviews it is obvious that Steve Harris and the boys aren't Satanists (at least, i HOPE they aren't). Then, once you get over that you sit down and put it in your CD player.Invaders: The sequel to the B Side Invasion (an interesting song, as it is with the Harris, Murray, Di'anno and Doug Sampson line up), it has an intro that will sound familiar to Metallica fans (Whiplash), and is a solid song.Children of the Damned: WOW, what a song. the drumming by Clive Burr really stands out as well as some classic guitar work. (An interesting note, you can also sing the chorus as Silence of the Lambs!)The Prisoner: With the classic cry of "i'm not a number" and drum intro, it's hard not to like this song, with it's catchiness and the pre solo ("which sounds a bit like Thunderstruck")really shows how far Maiden had come in the two years since their first album22 Acacia Avenue: NOT A FEMINIST SONG! If your listening to the album with yourt mother/sister/girlfriend skip this track! the sequel to the clasic Charlotte the Harlot this song easily outstrips the original in music terms, lyrically though... the original all the wayThe Number of the Beast: the title track and one that inspired a lot of panic and hubub in the US is a fair effort, released as a single and reaching the top 20, it showed that the good British public didn't mind the Satanic connectionRun to the Hills: The first single of the album and the first song i ever heard. This song converted me to a Metalhead and deserves every bit of praise it receives. Even my parents can listen to it without gnashing their teeth.Gangland: the first song (apart from Charlotte) to not have Steve's name in the writing credit (written by Adrian and Clive), this song has a sort of jazzy vibe to it, though it just sounds great!Total Eclipse: the B side to Run to the Hills, this song is a blend of hard rock and bitter-sweet ballard, the only (very possiblly) weak point on the albumHallowed be thy Name: This is it! you've sat through the entire album and you get rewarded for this classic. Released as a single from the 1992 Donington performance (Nicko's a great drummer, but he lack's Clive's speed and power, you'll see what i mean). The last hour of a condemned man, it drips with guitar work and drums, well worth the wait.So, Number of the beast was Maiden's most controversial album... but would prove to be the most successful yet! Should you buy it? Hell YES (no pun intended)
A1F1HEY8U4LQ4Q	1	1	Gloria Mallette has done it again. this book was so good I could'nt put the book down. it has soooo many twist and turns that you can't wait to get to the next page. this certainly a modern day version of Cain and Able, only it's the female version. this is a must read.
A1F1NHO5UXAGR3	1	1	This fun movie reminded me of Fargo with its small town outlandish sense of humor. Like with many Hitchcock movies, even the lesser known, one can see how they paved the way for many modern films.
A1F1NHO5UXAGR3	1	1	This was a fantastic leading duo. It's unfortunate Sean Connery and Tippi Hedren didn't go on to make more movies together. They commanded your attention in every scene. This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. It offered what you expect from Hitchcock: the captivating leading couple, suspense, bizarre psychological behavior, great sets and masterful direction. It's unfortunate the problems between Tippi Hedren and Hitchcock deprived moviegoers from making other films together.
A1F1NHO5UXAGR3	1	0	Only Hitchcock could pull off a full length movie filmed with one set...a Lifeboat. If you are expecting a typical AH movie featuring great locations and suspense, you may be bored. However, if your want great characters, quality acting and masterful direction, you may appreciate the Lifeboat.
A1F1TPLVG88KZP	1	1	I bought and read The Bluest Eyes yesterday at the bookstore and today it was announced as Oprah's new pick. I have read and enjoyed Toni Morrison before so I was anxious to read this short story. I was not disappointed and did not go to sleep until the book was finished. What struck me in the story is that beyond the prejudice of color the characters lives are all touched by some element of &quot;being looked down upon.&quot; All the characters face the pain of not being respected and treated decently by others. Pecola unfortunately happens to be the one that is at the bottom of the heap so to speak. This story touched me because so often people look for the &quot;ugly&quot; in others to make themselves feel better and don't stop to think how deeply hurtful that is to others. Haven't we all wished for something to make us more beautiful, more loved like Pecola who dreams that merely changing the color of her eyes would change the direction of her life.
A1F1VPTDTNAB9P	0	1	I cannot believe in the reviews I read here... You Americans can be real fascists when you want... some of you apparently believe in one kind of god that fits only in primitive societies... try to understand, world is bigger than your country (a great and beautiful country, I have to say, full of great values).
A1F1VPTDTNAB9P	0	1	but try to do more than just stay in your home, reading your bible... world is really more difficult to understand than you fundamentalists think...
A1F24CZJ9PHSYO	1	1	Just what the USA needed. I good swift kick in the seeds of the Metal scene brought to you by Cellador. Tired of the Nu-Metal, Death Metal and Grindcore scene? Give Cellador a listen and be prepared to be blown away. These guys are obviously weened on Maiden, Priest and Helloween, but have their own distinct style. Hyperfast musicianship ala Dragonforce. But while I enjoy Dragonforce a lot, I think that the guys in Cellador actually are better song writers. Blazing lead guitars and dual lead harmonies, great vocals somewhat like Tobias (Edguy) and Dickinson, these guys are destined for greatness. Now, here is the kicker. These guys are not from Europe but from Omaha, NE USA. Check these guys out live. I've seen them twice in the Twin Cities area and have been blown away both times. Buy this disc, crank it up and melt your ears off!
A1F24CZJ9PHSYO	1	1	My daughter received this Polaroid DVD player as a gift this year. Both kids really enjoy using the player and want to take it everywhere with them.This morning, my wife was leaving for piano lessons with the kids and they had the DVD player packed along. My wife decided that they didn't need to bring the player to piano lessons and in her haste, she took it away and put it on the garage floor next to the car.Upon the return home from piano lessons the fact that the DVD player was still on the garage floor was forgotten and my wife proceeded to drive over it in her BMW 3 series. The player was driven over by one tire in the process. The player was scraped on the bottom and the side seam was popped slightly. Incredibly the screen, DVD disc inside and casing did not break! The DVD player works just like before. Discs play fine, no damage effects on the screen, audio is fine and it can still be used with or without the AC power cord.I wasn't a Polaroid fan before, but this experience gives me pause to consider Polaroid in future purchase decisions.

A1F2HY36X5LT78	1	1	My mom checked this LP (record) out from the library so much back in the early 80s that I still know the songs word for word. I was so happy to get the CD, and my son loves marching around the house to the songs now. And now, thanks to Amazon, I've discovered more of Hap Palmers cute albums. I recommend this highly.
A1F2HY36X5LT78	1	1	So nice to have a toy that doesn't need batteries but still entertains.When we go on trips, especially car trips, I pack a bag of little, simple toys and sturdy books and hand my 1.5-year-old one every so often. This is a favorite, as are the Melissa & Doug firefly flashlight (awesome after sunset), rainstick, jingle bell wrist bands, travel size magnadoodle, lacing cards and M&D; latches puzzle and maze puzzle. That's usually enough to get us to our next stop, so I can gather everything from the floor and start over!With this one, we've figured out that a deeper voice makes better echo/noise, and if you hit it against your palm, sometimes you'll get cool noises!
A1F2HY36X5LT78	1	1	When I was little, I had a "Tommee Tippee Cup" that looked like this, almost exactly. The main difference was a solid white convex lid. I went looking for one when my son was going off bottles, and discovered that while the Tommee Tippee company still is going strong, they don't still make "tippy" cups (doesn't it seem like it's part of their name?). So I was so happy to find this one.The first one we had might have had a little manufacturing defect, because the first time my son used it, he was standing in the kitchen and dropped it (a fall of no more than fourteen inches) and the bottom split right off. I was initially frustrated, but since I'd just opened it, I still had the literature that came with it and contacted the company. They promised to send a replacement out right away, which they did, and we've been using it for - gosh - almost a year now? Nine months at least. The little handles are perfect for him, he "graduated" to the other top, the one without a spout, and now he's using the cup with no lid. It is holding up great and I'm really happy with the company.I am editing this to add: another reviewer mentioned the fast flow. When we first started using this, I simply put a piece of scotch tape over the vent hole, which slowed it down just right for my newly-off-bottles baby.
A1F2HY36X5LT78	1	1	I figure if it doesn't run on an operating system, I don't need the new version! This does an amazing job and our wood floors no longer have dustbunnies in the corners! My cat loves it too, which is a bonus, no battle!
A1F2J8LKDVZBLJ	0	0	I was a big kd lang fan at one time. I have all of her albums up to Ingenue and probably should get the one she did with Tony Bennett.I listened to this one in the record store and found it really boring. If you liked the songs done by the original artists, you won't like what kd has done with them. The only song I really like is Hallelujah. I used to think that kd could make even singing the phone book sound good! I'm sorry to see that for albums like Drag and All You Can Eat, she seems to have taken me up on it. At least for this album, she picked some good songs.Still, if you loved Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, you might be like me and not want to hear them done by another artist. It just doesn't cut it for me. I wish kd would go back to country. I loved Absolute Torch and Twang, Shadowland, and Angel with a Lariat.

A1F2NRCTKNPFLT	0	0	I had this watch for about 4 months until it fell off my belt yesterday and I lost it.The pin between clip and watch broke a month ago and I repaired it with a paperclip.The thermometer was consistently 20 degrees warmer than ambient temperature.The altimeter was consistent 100 ft lower than actual altitude, even after a manual reset.The compass I didn't verify but it comes with a complicated calibration procedure.The screen started fading after 4 months use, which fixed with reset but still annoying. Physically the face started showing a lot of wear after 4 months, just hanging off my belt.This is a cute toy but it has too many functions I don't need and the functions I didn't need didn't work right. I will replace it with the Casio Pathfinder next, I wouldn't buy from this company again. Also Timex has a similar watch on Amazon but reviews show it to be similarly inaccurate, Casio is apparently the gold standard for this kind of gadget.
A1F2NRCTKNPFLT	0	0	I have a RepairMaster 5Y warranty for an LG washer dryer. First it took them 2 weeks to honor the warranty. I have a cracked drain hose which, due to LG design, and confirmed by a call to LG, is only technician-replaceable. The RepairMaster/Warrantech warranty is filled with exclusions not printed on the card you receive when you buy the warranty. When I described the problem to RepairMaster/Warrantech, they refused to fix it, stating that it fell under their exclusions. They claim it is an external user-serviceable part in spite of LG claiming that the connection is internal and not user-serviceable.RepairMaster/Warrantech has a C- rating with Better Business Bureau. I think any company that sells their warranties (including Amazon), should also have a C- rating.
A1F2NRCTKNPFLT	1	0	I have wide feet and walk a lot and these are good shoes for that.I am taking off one star because I ordered black shoes and Amazon sent me brown shoes. Even as I am typing this review, the product description says "Rockport Men's Northfield Oxford,Black,10.5 XW" and Amazon is showing a picture of brown shoes. I should have known to go by the picture and not the description and cancelled the order and re-entered it. It's too much of a hassle to return shoes so I'm wearing brown now, it's a different fashion statement, but I'll live with it.I can live with it because I know that I wear these shoes out in 6 months, so I just reorder same shoes every 6 months. I think this is a reasonable wear rate given the amount of walking I do. I don't expect them to last forever, it's like changing tires on a car.
A1F2YZLJT2RBIY	0	1	I love Shania and think the new song Party For Two is great, and even better when it rocks with Mark. But the last song I Ain't No Quitter is awful. The worst song I think she has ever done. I guess I like the pop side of Shania more, than the country side. This cd has all her country versions and not the pop. So I was disappointed. I know the artists has to sway for the way country is moving, but I think it won't sell as much.Sorry Shania, release You Shook Me All Night Long on the rock stations, and you would be a bigger hit!
A1F2YZLJT2RBIY	1	1	Universal still has no plans to release this dvd in America. The good news is that, the complete first seasons have been released in the UK in pal format. Check out amazon.co.uk to buy the first seasons of BW and SMDM.
A1F2YZLJT2RBIY	0	0	After the hits Redneck Woman, Here For The Party and the new single All Jacked Up. I was All Jacked Up for this new cd. I put it in and I was Jacked, and then I loved the lyrics and the song to California Girls. But after that, its all garbage. All slow twangy crap. The only song worth a damn after that is the bonus track from Target. Overall. A VERY BIG disappointment and I can see why it won't do well as the first. Sorry Gretch. Better Luck next time!
A1F36GIXGCSLB7	0	0	A friend of mine owned one of these roasters; still does own it, actually, but now it's not useful for anything except a storage bin. She used it a total of nine times in about two and a half years of ownership, for such things as holiday turkeys and hams, and for roasting pork shoulders for pork barbecue. It was on the pork shoulders that the roaster exhibited the same behavior that so many others have reported. The Teflon coating started to bubble and peel, to the point that about 30 percent of the roaster was exposed bare metal. Fortunately, very little of the Teflon got into the meat, and we were able to save it. But the roaster was toast, and KitchenAid refused to replace it. She'd had it too long, even though it had hardly been used. I can only advise others to avoid this product. It clearly, based on our experience and others, has major design flaws.
A1F36GIXGCSLB7	1	1	With all of the books out there that write alternate history from some obvious point of diversion, this one was a welcome change. Conroy takes the premise that Kaiser Wilhelm II, eager to expand his empire and demonstrate the power of his German Empire, tried to bully the United States into surrendering its gains from the Spanish-American War. The U.S., although unprepared for war against a first-rate European power, tells the Kaiser to choke on his schnitzel. Germany then sets into motion a war plan that they actually did draw up in real life, using their powerful navy to send an army across the Atlantic and attack New York.After a series of initial defeats at the hands of the powerful German army, the U.S. stabilizes the front, and likely gets a huge break when President McKinley dies, making Theodore Roosevelt the new President. Roosevelt appoints the aged James Longstreet as overall commander, and quietly orders the U.S. Regular Army (then busy fighting Aguinaldo in the Philippines in real life) back home. The U.S. Navy tricks the Germans into a battle on the high seas, where the U.S. ships were at an advantage. The German Army responds with an attack toward Boston, but are crushed by the arrival of the Regulars. The Americans get into the German rear at New York, cutting off the attackers and forcing a mass surrender.The book ends with the Kaiser going into exile 17 years early, and an ominous note for the future, as two members of the new German leadership discuss blaming the defeat on the Jews, agree that Germany should focus on expansion in Europe, instead of colonies, and toast the coming of a "Third Reich." The U.S., flush with its second decisive defeat of a European power in three years, agrees on plans to build up its standing army. There's a sequel here if Conroy ever wanted to write it.There are some minor factual inaccuracies, but the plot as a whole is very plausible and believable. The Germans were this arrogant and overconfident, and always did underestimate the United States. The U.S. would have been unprepared for war, but would have stood a good chance to win if they held on long enough to consolidate their resources. And this is a plan that the Germans apparently considered carrying out at one time; all it would have taken was a word from their notably unstable Kaiser.
A1F36GIXGCSLB7	1	1	Let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed this book, and I've read a number of other accounts of the time period which included the Third Crusade, Richard Lionheart, and Saladin. I don't really accept the claims of other reviewers that the account is biased against the Crusaders, because there are plenty of contemporary sources that clearly suggest that, in this era at least, the Muslims held more of what little moral high ground there was. Saladin hasn't maintained the respect of the Western world for 800 years for nothing. Where the book comes up short as a historical work is that the author frequently editorializes on what he felt the motives of the main characters were, and I don't feel he was always correct (he may have been, but from a vantage point eight centuries later, we can never know). He portrays the King of France, Philip Augustus, as weak. Richard may well have been his better, but Philip's subsequent history clearly demonstrates he wasn't the man portrayed here. Later in the book, he portrays Richard himself as weak and vacillating when he retreated from the vicinity of Jerusalem a second time in 1191. Richard was the foremost Western military mind of his day, and even at this time it is obvious to an impartial observer that even a successful capture of Jerusalem would have set him up for a logistical nightmare in holding and defending it. The fact that he risked ridicule and accusations of cowardice, rather than imperil his men in a militarily unsound attack, was in itself an act of courage, not of faint-heartedness. If he had attacked Jerusalem, he would have taken it...and the day he left, Saladin would have just taken it back, and likely destroyed another Christian army. I can gladly recommend this book, but don't take all of the author's opinions as the final word on the subject.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	The third studio-recorded album, fifth album in the running. Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Surfacing were the albums that defined Sarah McLachlan as she developed and evolved as the artist we all know and love. Afterglow is another album in the order that should not be denied the same attention give to others.It is true that this album does not provide the same grit and rock that Fumbling Torwards Ecstasy gave the world... but this isn't called Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Again now is it? It sure isn't, as was shown by her following album, Surfacing, which proved to be yet another powerful album. Different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy yes, but better or worse no. Fumbling Towards Ecstasy may have set Sarah into the spotlight of what a true artist is, but a true artist continues to create new music, in a driven state to re-invent and create original sound. Her albums get more and more calmer, if that's the right word. I found Fumbling Towards Ecstasy full of her raw, depressed lyrics from the heart. Surfacing is like she is literally surfacing to the world and seeing the beauty of love. Afterglow seems to be talking about the quiet and calmness of solidarity yet still laced with bitter thoughts. Sarah's albums are each unique in sound, as Afterglow demonstrates itself.As Sarah does help create her own music and write her own lyrics, her music will inevitably change over the years as her life itself does change as well. From Sarah's own words:&quot;When anyone asks 'Why did it take so long in between records?'&quot; Sarah explains, unhesitatingly, &quot;The answer is that I was just living my life. I lost a mother and I became a mother. Almost a year after having India, I walked away from music for a few months. I didn't play my piano, I didn't open up my journals, I just really needed to let go of all the pressures and the expectations of 'it's been so long...gotta get this record out' stuff. I felt paralyzed. Taking a break and walking away was the best thing I could have done. I came back to it with fresh ears, listened to the tracks, and I realized that it was all sounding really good and to finish it didn't seem impossible anymore. That's my truth. It's honest, and it brought me to a much happier place. I'm loving music again.&quot; (sarahmclachlan.com)Another interesting fact about this album is that she did not write a single song on the guitar, it was all written while on the piano.Her life is in these songs, as can be described by emotions evoked by Fallen, and Stupid. Push is one of her more joyful songs describing the love between her and her husband, Ashwin Sood (percussions).A much more softer-toned album, but not any less quality than previous albums. Taking you from the sad tones of Fallen, to the familiarity of World on Fire, from the blissful yet chaotic times of Stupid, to times of being that Perfect Girl... this album showcases not only her talent, but her life as well.I was personally fortunate enough to experience her live on her Afterglow Tour of 2004; her songs came truly alive with the true sounds of her songs. Listening to her album again really livened up the songs.The glow remains even after listening to Afterglow...
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	Center of the Sun is now my favorite single off of Rhys Fulber's Conjure One album.Breaking away from Bill Leebs of the group Delerium, Rhys Fulber created for himself Conjure One, and debuted with a self-titled album.Center of the Sun is a more uplifting, relaxed version of Delerium's songs. Eerie synths, beautiful strings, even more elegant vocals provided by Poe."They say the most horrible things, but I hear violins."Junkie XL's mix of Center of the Sun is a great track, Junkie XL's classic acoustic sounds and moving beat. Filtered vocals set the mix's vocals apart from the original's, but not in a demeaning way. Solarstone's mix takes chilled to another level combining ambient sounds creating a amazxing combination of the original vocals and new sounds.Amazing track, great single.(*To elaborate on the previous reviewer's comment on the song being on the X-Men movie, X2: X-Men United, he was correct. I was obssessed with that movie, even bought the soundtrack to it. I have never heard that song on the movie, and the movie only offers a original score done by John Ottman. Re-watching the movie, the song is playing in the background in the X-Men mansion, after the scene with Senator Kelly and Stryker, it shows Collosus and Flea drawing and making fun of Rogue and Bobby, who are about to kiss. This is right before Wolverine comes back into the mansion after visiting Alkali Lake. I thought it was awesome to hear this song, even though it was in-directly. Genius to do that, Bryan Singer or whoever.)
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	"If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, the ripple effect could cause a tempest on the other." --Chaos TheoryStarting off with a quote of the Chaos Theory. Background info about the quote and theory. "The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done" (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, pg. 141). So the movie is relating to the idea that a small, unseemingly insignificant action would cause drastic changes in the future.Ashton Kutcher plays a college student who had intermittent black-outs, periods of time that would be lost from memory, could be stirred and remembered simply by reading journal entries he wrote as a child to help him remember. Acting that seemed rushed and confused by younger actors, it depicts the life of a troubled boy, a brother and sister with a pedophile father, and a boy with extreme emotional problems all friends in horrible, graphic events. But by reading these journal events would cause him to go back in time, time-traveling if you want to call it, enabling him to change something in the past, thus rippling the change of the past to the future. Each time he would go back to the past and change something, it would result in a different situation in the future. He doesn't make small changes, but drastic ones, causing huge changes in the future. Not like the fluttering of a butterfly's wings but the sheer force of a hurricane permanently rearranging the once and preserved future.Ashton Kutcher puts a well-meaning performance, far atypical of his real-life and other acting personas (Punk'd, That 70's Show, Just Married...), in a genre that the audience has never seen. Though this may deter some to even watch this movie, the movie itself is so shocking and dramatic that the idea of Kutcher being the aloof Kelso is left far behind.The movie does what every movie should do: it keeps the audience wide-eyed for the movie, starting off strong with profound, twisted events, leaving the audience with morbid curiosity. Although R-Rated for intense, graphic situations and controversial issues, this movie may be too intense for some.The movie leaves the audience in a state of fascination, distraughtedness, and deep thought. The theme in the movie lends it one of the many, especially after watching either one of two versions: Director's Cut or Theatrical Presentation. (Director's Cut has a extremely odd ending, different from the Theatrical Presentation) Though one will get the idea that love drives us all to do anything for the sake of it, and the sheer realization that self-sacrifice is something we must all do in order to keep things in order.Great directing, and story builds great with minor holes. However it doesn't not finish it with finesse, leaving the audience more bewildered and distraught than a deer caught in headlights. Acting is subpar, seemingly rushed and lacking in focus. Though credit should be given to Ashton Kutcher and Melora Walters for their performance.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	This is definitely the best of Delerium from their work on their 4 major album releases: Semantic Spaces to their most recent, Chimera. A decade of beautiful music.So unlike most "Best Of" albums out there, this is a very good compilation of their best singles... including a few re-mix singles (though some true Delerium fans would have to disagree because Delerium's earlier work, like Spheres, were not included). Ten years (Semantic Spaces was released in 1994 and Chimera released in 2003, spread over 10 years) of Delerium. So anyone who does not own any Delerium albums, but would like a sample of their greatest, this is the album for you. Good balance of re-mixes and selections from their albums. Trip-hop beats, beautiful instrumental melodies, layers of gothic to electronic to ambient sounds, etheral and moving vocals... Delerium is one of moving artists of it's genre, if you can truly classify what they do as one genre.I recommend this to anyone who already are fans of Delerium as well. It has 2 un-released original songs by Delerium, available only though this album. "Paris" feat. Aude and "You + I" feat. Zoe Johnston. It also has a re-mix of the classic, "Silence (21st Century Remix" feat. Sarah McLachlan by Above and Beyond. It is another great re-mix, featured on the upcoming updated single of "Silence", Silence 2004. The two new songs and re-mix are worth it... Instead of the original versions, re-mixes of "Truly (Wise Buddah Edit)" and "Underwater (Above and Beyond 21st Century Remix)" are put on this outstanding compilation.Tracks are as follows (all songs are not truly original, they are all edited for time, original appearence of tracks are listed next to songs):01. "Flowers Become Screens" feat. Kristy Thirsk [Semantic Spaces]02. "Silence" feat. Sarah McLachlan [Karma]03. "Paris" feat. Aude [previously un-released] *04. "Truly (Wise Buddah Edit)" feat. Nirina Pallot [Truly - Single, original version on Chimera]05. "Terra Firma" feat. Aude [Poem]06. "Incantation" feat. Kristy Thirsk [Semantic Spaces]07. "After All" feat. Jael of Lunik [Chimera]08. "Underwater" (Above and Beyond 21st Century Remix) feat. Rani [Underwater - Single, Odyssey: The Remix Collection, original version on Poem]09. "Run For It" feat. Leigh Nash [Chimera]10. "Remembrance", Instrumental [Karma]11. "You & I" feat. Zoe Johnston [previously un-released] **12. "Innocente" feat. Leigh Nash [Poem]13. "Euphoria" (Firefly) feat. Jacqui Hunt [Karma]14. "Silence (Above and Beyond 21st Century Remix" feat. Sarah McLachlan [previously un-released] **** "Paris" feat. Aude is a song that is reminiscent of Johann Pachelbel's masterpiece, "Canon". Very similar in style and sound of the [Poem] album.** "You + I" feat. Zoe Johnston, is a unique, amazing track, most likely recorded during the recording of [Chimera] though most likely not used on the album because of its very different sound and mood (I was thinking more of Conjure One when I heard this). Zoe's vocals shine in this track, beautifully done. Beautiful track.*** "Silence (Above and Beyond 21st Century Remix)" feat. Sarah McLachlan, is a great re-mix of the all-time classic. Similar in fast layered trance beats of Above and Beyond's other remixes, this one is no different in quality of sound and arrangement. Nice new remix.If the great song playlist isn't enough, the artwork on the album should be able to pull you in. Artwork for Delerium is credited to the wonderful, Carylann Loeppky. Her artwork seen on the Best Of album should not go un-noticed, it is her best. It is strange and beautiful at the same time resulting in a great combination of emotions.A album highly recommended to all.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden - better known as Gabriel & Dresden - boast one of the most impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;s in contemporary dance music, with over half a dozen #1 Billboard Dance chart hits to their credit, including remixes for Annie Lennox, Jewel, Sarah McLachlan, and Britney Spears. They have released on Nettwerk a 2-disc set duly titled "Bloom". Their highly-anticipated debut album is finally here.The set was made using songs that the duo felt passionate about, as well as key hits from their own catalog. They rounded out the album with new composed material.Great progressive album that is surely unique in contrast to the popular hits of now. Instead of doing an album full of just top hits, they went and did another route typical of their definitive G&D; style.Original songs by the duo: "Arcadia", "Serendipity" (dub version of G&D;'s Gotta Thank Mix of Coldplay's "Clocks" without the vocals or piano melody), Lament, Dub Horizon, and their collaboration with Elevation "Athena".There is the new beautiful, yet ominous, Andain's cover of Depeche Mode's "Here is the House" (another track with sounds provided by the duo), Michael Burn's poundin' "Forwards" (very, very nice track), Junkie XL's awesome mix of Sarah McLachlan's "World On Fire" complete with signature Junkie XL acoustics (Original mix is available on Sarah McLachlan's "Stupid" single CD), Audioholic's "External Key" with a capella from Andain's "Beautiful Things", Voyager's "Someone Else" with a capella from Motorcycle's "As The Rush Comes".The hard-hitting sounds of G&D;'s mix of Lili Haydn's "Anything" is heard on the second album (G&D;'s E-String Mix is highly recommended; Lili's vocals are superb though the dub is equally as great), new great mix of Dido's "Don't Leave Home" (song arrangment is great and Dido's vocals really shine in this mix with a interesting filter), as well as G&D;'s mix of Above and Beyond's "No One On Earth" featuring Zo Johnston of Faithless (one of the best tracks so far in 2004), some tracks from Josh Gabriel, Push's "Electric Eclipse", and finishs off very nicely with Motorcycle's next upcoming single, "Imagination", with just acoustics and Jes' lovely voice.With time, this album becomes a delight to your ears... A fantastic compilation of tracks, balanced in vocal and instrumental tracks, resulting in an album that will remain for a long time. Highly recommended for any fans of G&D; or people who just want to listen to something other than Trance Party volumes or another DJ Tiesto album...DISC ONE:1. Gabriel & Dresden - Arcadia2.

A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	I proudly have a pair of [white] ones. Amazon.com only sells them in black, but if you go to Warehouse123.com, they can sell you white ones. May be more expensive, but if you want [white], that's what you have to pay. It was all in the sake of my iPod to match it's whiteness. They are also available on SonyStyle.com for about $50.The earphones will be the same, regardless of color. (Of course.)Sound: The sound is awesome! Because of it's superior quality and closed-type design, you can re-listen to every little sound, echo, filters to acapellas... it's amazing how much details you can hear. It really does pick up EVERY single sound. Imagine this in the aspect of working with digital images. Most earphones can only provided so much sound... let's say 200% zoom. These will provided you with minimum 600% zoom. So that's really good. Bass is great too, you just need to make sure you have the right sized silicon earpieces on the earphones to perfectly fit your ears so they will pick up the bass. Otherwise, if you put on ear coverings that are too small, you will get no bass at all.Design: It looks great... again, I prefer the white ones. The biggest problem I noticed previous reviewer's reviews was that the cord for the earphones were too short. I thought it couldn't be that bad... but they really are. From the part that the cord splits to the individual earpieces, you'll have 15 inches of cord to connect to your music player. Basically, you have to be holding it next to your neck for it not to be jerking your head around. It comes with an extension cord, that makes it longer. It is approx. 35 inches, almost 3 feet. So... that will definitely give you more cord space. The extension cord in my opinion did not weigh the headphones down at all. Just note that the reason why the cord is so short is because the headphones are "remote-friendly". Thus, ideal for music players with remotes as many Sonys do as well as the remote offered for iPods.Another part of the design is that the earpieces don't exactly split up into two pieces and go straight up to your ears. Like most Sonys... one of the individual earpiece's cords is short, while the other one is long. You wear the short one to your left ear, the other goes around the back of your head to the other ear (the long one). I prefer this design over the common one because you don't have those situations where the cord runs into your neck or face...Comfort: I tried the small silicon earpieces, but they were too small and I did not get any bass. Though it was comfortable and I did not feel it at all due to the ultra light-weight of the earbuds. To get bass I had to wear the larger silicon ear coverings, which was very similar in feeling to wearing a doctor's stethoscope. It's just one of those things that you have to get used to, but once you start listening to music you dont's notice it as much. But bass is necessary to have... small price to pay. After wearing a few days, you get used to the feeling.Price: For the quality of sound... this is definitely a good bargain compared to other similar earphones of the same price range.Conclusion: Could be improved definitely, comfort for in-ear type earphones is tricky... and it's definitely one of the better ones in that area. Sound quality is exceptional.*Personal notes:- The in-ear feeling may be very, very uncomfortable at first. But no need to worry, you get used to it in a matter of minutes with music playing. After a few days of wearing them, you'll have no uncomfortableness at all. Just be sure to test all earpieces out to find the perfect one. One way to make sure is play a song with good bass. The earpieces with the best bass reception is the perfect fit.- Make sure to be careful with the earpieces. The earpieces may fall out at times, not on its own but it's not un-ordinary to get earphones tangled up or dropped.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	This live album is better in aspect of being an album versus Mirrorball. Her Mirrorball performance was amazing, as was Afterglow. Afterglow was electrifying really, moreso after seeing her perform her songs live for her Afterglow Tour (sorry to those who didn't get to see her).Two discs means more songs, as it does put ten songs on a disc giving more time to the songs and allowing more coverage of the performance. (Mirrorball was only 14 tracks.) It doesn't mean they put the entire performance into the album, but still a good coverage.Though, seeing Sarah live is unmatched, but hearing her live is at least somewhat closer ;)Live renditions of her songs are always a pleasure to hear, if you liked Afterglow and/or haven't heard her Mirrorball album, this is definitely something you should think about getting. Sarah does sit down for the piano for most of this performance, beautifully. My favorite from her performance was "Fear", a very strong song, though not on the album (The DVD is highly recommended as well, Sarah shows a lot of personality that they edit out of the album, because well, it's the whole performance not just the songs).(Sarah did not perform any songs from before her Fumbling Towards Ecstasy album as she was putting Solace and Touch behind her.)
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	What an amazing movie.Showing issues of so many aspects: religion, life, sexuality, and love. Finding a meaning to your life to allow yourself to find who you are. Finding something you believe in, and why you believe.This movie isn't just about religion though, as many people just focus on the Mormon aspect of Sandvoss' character, it's much more than just that.A story of a Mormon missionary, Aaron, who moves in with other missonaries next to a gay man named Christian. What starts off as bet of Christian trying to convert one of the missionaries (instead of them converting him). Christian, the "perfect" guy who never gets turned down, finds that Aaron is not just another guy to sleep with. Aaron makes Christian reflect upon his life, as Christian helps Aaron find something in his life.It's a moving, gripping, emotional story portrayed so well by Steve Sandvoss (his first real movie debut) and Wes Ramsey, all directed under the creative mind of C.J. Cox (who was also a Mormon missionary when he was younger before coming out).It's not a typical romance, as it is between two men, showing the struggles of being homosexual, struggles of keeping the relationship started and alive, coming out, and finding who you are and what life means to you.It's not just a gay romance; it's so much more than that...I highly recommend this to anyone not searching for a gay romance, but something that will change your life, even just a little bit.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	A portrayal of life in its beauty, harshness, it's pure form of reality. It's dark, haunting, and depressing. The little joys in life is something we all share, as well as the indifferent, and the evil. A brutal assault of images, scenes, and memories.The definition of requiem is a mass for the dead, in this film's title, a mass for the death of dreams. Each character in this movie has their own desire.We all have dreams, as do the characters in this film. Sara Goldfarb played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry (Jay Leto). Now a elderly widow living on her own, she has nothing but infomercials as her companion. Harry is a drug addict, getting by on unknown monetary means, using what little money he does have for riding taxis and buying drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) plays his best friend and his girlfriend is played is Marion (Jennifer Connelly).Sara gets a call that she is eligible to win for a spot on the show that she religiously watches. She belives she will get a chance to be on the show, something she is dreaming of. Wanting to fit into a dress, that she had worn years ago to her son's high school graduation, so that she may wear it on the show. She attempts to follow a diet to lose weight to no avail. The cravings are too strong and she resorts to taking advice from her friend: diet pills prescribed through a doctor. She wants nothing but to be on the show, to be loved by millions through telvision, to have them love her son, to love her husband. Being able to wear the dress to her is being young again, to be thin again, to regain the feeling she got from being with her husband. An escape from her lonely reality to one where all her wishes come true.Harry, Tyrone, and Marion do drugs together and are dependant on them. Harry and Tyrone try to sell drugs to make more money. Marion is an artist and Harry wants to open a space for her drawings. He is attempting to make money to open the space so they may achieve this as well as be together. Tyrone seems to only share one memory of his mother as a child that seems to plague him increasingly. Harry wants nothing but the ones he loves to be happy: his mother and his girlfriend. Tyrone longs for his mother's arms. Marion is detatched and has nothing but money.With amazing director direction and cinematography, the story increases in its drama and intensity. A roller coaster of their lives, drugs and addictions, their individual dreams all leading into a fall that is inevitable-- that some might not be able to handle. Only turning for a requiem, for all their dreams.So much emphasis put on drugs, though that is the vehicle on which their troubles ride, is not the entire movie. Whatever it is, is for you to see in this film.It is traumatic to watch, yet fulfilling. Because of its highly graphic and extremely difficult content, it is only recommended for those who can handle it. The director's cut leaves nothing out, the full edit of constant scenes that lead to the group of character's downfalls and leaving you stunned and speechless. What we are willing to do for what we want and think we need-- and how far we will go to get it. Even if it means losing ourselves in the fury of it all.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	I was extremely skeptical of even buying this album. I thought Tiesto was energetic, but not amazing live-- his original compositions usually lacked something-- and only his remixes seemed to stand out. Basically, I thought DJ mag was full of it and Tiesto was way overrated.After finally listening to this album and Parade of the Atheletes, I strongly disagree with my opinion I had before and am amazed of how skeptical I was even before trying a sample of the real Tiesto.I have never listened to Tiesto's other full-release album, In My Memory, so other reviewers who angrily state that Tiesto has lost his touch, or failed with this album, I would have to disagree. Many artists, as Tiesto is a true musician, don't stick to the same style and same exact music that made them who they are in the first place. Tiesto spins and mixes trance from across the world-- it's never the same as listened to in his In Search of Sunrise Vol. 3 and Nyana, as well as his numerous remixes from Sarah McLachlan to the Dave Matthews Band. Ferry Corsten did not stay with his well-known melodic trance and went house with his recent album Right of Way. Oakenfold's style is all-around as most of his albums are mainly progressive to melodic trance, his full-release album Bunkka proved that Oakenfold's diverse styles and abilities as a musician. How is Tiesto any different?Just Be is an album filled with sorrowful strings and a beat that flows with effervescent energy that Tiesto seems to channel too well. Each song is filled with energy, making you want to get up and move-- to do something. 6 tracks of the the total 10 are vocals, 4 are instrumentals. To many this is discouraging, I think it's beautiful."Forever Today" starts off the album with slow strings that stops and leads into a fast-paced beat that washes over you with strings and synths. This track leads you into the next track where BT sings his heart out, "Love Comes Again".Similar to his housey-synth melodies in "Traffic" or sounds of "Lethal Industry", "Loves Comes Again" is another floor-thumping track complete with vocals from BT and music from Tiesto. Lethal combination.. This leads you into the intersection of "Traffic"."Traffic" is a track with pulsing bass and dramatic synth melodies. Just another one of your Tiesto anthems (wink)."Sweet Mysery" is my personal favorite off the album. A slower beat and highly different from his other tracks before, this song is heavy with lots of heavy synths and strings, not to mention the almost eerie-industrial feel to it. The lush vocals complete this track, making it one of the best ones."Nyana" first made its appearence on his Nyana album, what a classic track this is. Gives you a nostalgic feeling of the classic trance days, a progressive trance song that just washes over you in a euphoric wave."Ur" is yet another ominous, slow track with a trip-hop beat rather than a trance beat. This track really reminds me of a track from Rob Dougan, from the trip-hop beat to gritty vocals and overall feel. Great melody at the climax of the song. Truly emotionally-charged."Walking on Clouds" picks the album up from the depressing feel of "Ur", with amazing vocals from Kirsty Hawkshaw (She was the vocals behind many tracks for artists such as Delerium and Orbital). Nothing too hard, just a simpler, soaring song."A Tear in the Open" opens up with just foreign vocals (no idea what language it is, sounds Mediterranean or Middle Eastern). Another strong song... my second favorite. Far from the sounds of "Nyana" or the house feel of "Traffic", it explores the vocals and turns them into a pulsing track."Just Be". Great lyrics, great vocals, great beat. No more explanation needed on the first single from the album."Adagio For Strings" the infamous Adagio for String originally composed by Samuel Barber, later turned popular by William Orbit who did his own rendition of the classical piece, as well as by Ferry Corsten. This is all-around favorite for most people, taking the beautiful melody of the classical piece and turning it into a 7-minute floor-grinding anthem.Tiesto did a marvelous job on this album, focusing more on his tastes of classical melodies it seems.This album, Just Be, him being the man behind the music for the 2004 Olympics in Athens, his Parade of Atheletes album from the Olympics, and his world-wide tour to all his fans... he deserves his third-straight title of DJ Mag's #1 in the world.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	World on Fire is the third single off Sarah McLachlan's bittersweet and toned-down sounds of Afterglow. Reflective of the past current events of the past few years and suffering around the world, it describes the feelings that Sarah feels as though she may try and help out as much as she can, but she can only do so much.This single is great because it includes a studio-recorded version as well as a live version, which is always great to have because live tracks from Sarah are so much more emotional and heart-driven.Junkie XL's radio mix is not as fast-paced as his club mix which can be found on Sarah's "Stupid" single. This radio edit has been played on various radio stations around the world, assuring that it is a good one. Keeping true to the original compostion of the song, but changing the melody and beat adding a darker feeling to the song with repetitive guitar melodies and dulling piano notes, it's a keeper.Solarstone's mix is truly chilled. Putting an atmospheric world to the song creating a relaxing landscape pulling on natural sounds of water and using ambient noises with guitar notes and piano notes. Solarstone's chilled mixes are amazing, as he did two remixes for Conjure One (Center of the Sun, Sleep).The video is amazing, you can watch it before you get this single at www.worldonfire.ca. It shows that a typical music video would have cost them $150,000, instead they spent only $15 on the video itself, and used the rest of the money in countries around the world, helping out children and others in need of aid. It is amazing how much money a video costs, but it's truely amazing how much the money that could have been spent on making one music video, helped a million people.It's expensive, but it's a single worth getting.On another note: be careful because there is another "World On Fire" single out in stores that is not on Amazon.com if you decide to go out and buy this single in a store instead. The other "World On Fire" single uses the same picture of Sarah from her "Stupid" single, and only has the original song and the Junkie XL radio edit. Look for this single, with Sarah in pink, and check the tracklist to make sure it includes all 5 of these tracks.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	These tracks are all full, un-cut, remixes by the great DJ Tiesto.You may recognize a few of the tracks, many you may not. This compilation is great because not only are the tracks in their original forms, but some tracks that are hard to get your hands on, especially on CD form.So if you're looking for some remixes by Tiesto, look no furthur.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	Matt Darey is back again with another mix that does not disappoint.Similar to AvB's ASOT2005 mix in only the themes of the seperate discs, the first disc is pure solid trance leaning towards "light" as an adjective. The second disc leans more towards "dark". But this mix folks, is nothing like the subpar selection of tracks that AvB decided to put on his annual ASOT CD mix.Matt Darey is one of the original trance masters-- a discography filled with endless mixes (such as mixing albums for the EUPHORIA series for the last six years), collaborations, original tracks, and of course, remixes. He does not disappoint ever-- and certainly does not with this album.From the words of Darey: "I've always loved playing and producing all genres of Trance, from the deeper grooves to the harder & more pumping styles and this album will take you on a journey through them all with the best of a broad selection of "upfront" Trance tunes. The one thing that has been prevalent throughout is that melody is the most important element of any music."Every single track was a kaskade of grooves, beats, and sounds; a true trance experience that did not let me down. If you were disappointed or even loved AvB's ASOT 2005 or Markus Schulz' Miami '05-- this is one mix album you should not miss out on.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	Here you have all his hit songs from the past Seven Years (1998-2005) under his name ATB. The album starts off in the year 2005, and moves backwards into his productions. (For me it would have been better to have it start from the first album, as you can hear the difference in sound and production from his first song and last.)From his first hit single, 9PM, which was named after which time it was when he completed it, to 6 brand-new tracks made just for this collection, this is perfect for anyone wanting to get a complete ATB album or for any ATB fan.From Movin' Melodies (9PM, Don't Stop), Killer) to Two Worlds (The Summer, The Fields of Love) you hear ATB's signature guitar sounds.Once you venture into his album Dedicated, you don't hear that sound anymore but you still get ATB as he evolves (Let U Go, Hold You, You're Not Alone) as he features Roberta Carter Harrison as the vocals on the album.ATB really showcases his music in Addicted to Music (I Don't Wanna Stop, Long Way Home, In Love With the D.J.) and shows a more mature, more developed style of music. He again works with Roberta to make some beautiful tracks.We then get to his most recent album, No Silence, where he shows a truly versatile side with variedsong arrangements and styles. With the first single featured in the movie, Mindhunters, Marrakech finally features a new vocalist, Tiff Lacey (Oakenfold, Conjure One). As well as two other tracks, Ecstasy and Here With Me.The rest are 5 new tracks and a 2005 re-work of "Let U Go", sung by the same vocalist on the third track as well as guitar melodies... (Roberta does a better job in my opinion, though the slower-pace and guitars are pretty sweet.)All tracks are edited for time and some are different from their original album appearences. You'll find edits that have never made any singles.With 6 brand-new tracks and edited tracks, this is definitely something for any ATB fan to get.Even if you're not a ATB album collector, it is definitely something to get your hands on if you have never experienced the sounds of ATB.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	Conceptualized by Justin Elswick (a full-time attorney, mind you) and brought to life with help from tech-genius Israel Curtis (this guy is amazing and often not credited enough by other reviews) and a bevy of talented, varied female vocalists. This is electronica/down-tempo focused with female vocalists. Any fans of female vocalists and electronic/new-age/pop tastes will need to hear this album. Each track is unique in sound with various influences from Elswick's vast musical palette. This is not simply a solo effort from Elswick and Curtis, Curtis himself helped in the creation of "Desire of Ages", and certain singers brought their own lyrics, vocal melodies, or compositions into this. It was a huge, collaborative effort creating this grand album that took over 2 years to complete. It includes two covers from Elswick's personal favorites, "The Chauffer" and "The Metro".13 tracks, 11 different vocalists -- you will never be bored with the variety of tracks featured. From Jody Quine to Nicola Hitchcock, Kirsty Hawkshaw to Kristy Thirsk... any fan of this genre or electronica will find at least one familiar name. These are a handful of the best singers of the electronic realm who have worked with various talented producers and deejays, and in my humble opinion, the music world.The music conjures extraordinary imagery, calling for landscapes of distant places, moods that surround you... I should know, I did the artwork (wink). I wrote a review for this specifically not only because I love the music, but also as I listened to the different tracks, it was not a difficult matter to lie out the different imagery. It was a simple matter, being only drawn from the emotional connection with the music.Exceptional music is not just auditory pleasure, it is music that brings multiple senses into play, and this album does beyond that. As Musical Discoveries adequately states, "...this album is auditory nirvana".
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	0	0	With no idea of what this movie was about except with a recommendation from a favored source, I rented this movie.The artwork for the cover and just the name conjured up imagery of a possibly dark but well-done story, mystery and the inevitable looming of a tragic event.What ended up happening was watching a movie that tried so hard to capture that of the high school awkwardness, playing the most random soundtrack (of course Eliot Smith was present), long, drawn-out slow-motion scenes (see the longest shower scene I have ever watched), and terrible, terrible acting.This felt like a well-done attempt by a college film student who had a passion for skateboarding (see random shots of skateboarders), who executed this movie by watching well-done films (see Darren Afronosky) and emulating those to create many of the scenes you will see here. See the splicing of present with past in order to keep the viewer enticed.Basically, this is a low-budget film without the low-budget, terrible song choices, terrible acting (this felt like films I've seen in Spanish class in high school), and just bad attempt.If you want to watch a film that does the time sequence story, murder, but with out the awkward adolescence, amazing acting, watch Boy A.Basically, just stay away from this film. Seriously.
A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	1	1	A bittersweet, quirky film only matched in its storytelling and emotions by a perfect soundtrack. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel lead real characters that most of us in this generation will relate to, and realize the solution to most of our misery derived from holding unto those good memories. A enlightened, and wise beyond her years, a 10-year old sister offers a honest and simple observations that we otherwise would never notice.
A1F3J7MKQNSK4K	0	0	Con:1). No auto-scan function to search an unused FM band, so that would easy to cause car accidents while drivers were trying to find an unused FM channel by manually operated----2). Sound's quality worse then car CD player.suggestion:The idea of this product which is good , but if you are thinking to buy this product, wait for a while!
A1F3J7MKQNSK4K	1	0	I haven't buy this watch yet because I notice this watch band size is weird as 14.8mm.....anyone knows about where we can buy this special size watch band for future replacement? Thanks
A1F3ME9EEGV8WT	1	1	a beautiful and handsome man's watch. i get alot of compliments on it. quality through and through. i am very happy with it.
A1F3ME9EEGV8WT	1	1	my old 1977 chev k10 truck was having serious choke problems with the old style divorced choke. it was the thermostatic type on the intake manifold. the crossover passage that runs under the carb is plugged up therefore the spring wouldn't heat up and the choke wouldn't kick down in a timely manner or sometimes it would stick open and not work at all. i saw this version of electric type and thought it was a very good idea. the install is pretty simple. i followed them to the letter. the next day it was about 0 degrees in the morning. i pumped the gas pedal about 2 times and she started right up. no more pumping like crazy to get it going. i noticed about 3-4 minutes later it was fully open and no more choke. perfect! all the other times it would either be still on or it would be stuck open. the price (60.00) seemed a little high but it will save my starter from working so hard and save gas. so far, so good.
A1F3ME9EEGV8WT	1	1	these gaskets rock! still to this day the area around the valve covers is dry as a bone. no more oil wicking thru the cork type of gaskets. make sure when you install them you mount them correctly. there is an up and down orientation. pricey but very worth it!
A1F3REOOGQ0Q5K	1	1	this is one of the greatest albums ever made. i have so many fond memories attached to this brilliant piece of spook-show bliss. two examples are the time i helped my mom clean out the basement, and the time my friends and i sped down the highway to get fitted for tuxedos. i first heard this cd drunk in my friends attic about 9 years ago and its stayed in my head ever since. i think he found it for a quarter at record exchange.
A1F3REOOGQ0Q5K	1	1	i received this album as a birthday present 3 years ago. its changed my life drastically since then... not just with music, but how i vision my existence as well. it also changed my entire group of friend's lives too. none of us have really been the same since this album (and this band) entered our lives. i've listened to it sober, and i've listened to it altered. either way, the album itself is a living, breathing entity. trans europe express isn't just a brilliant lp, its a place to visit. from the opening trainride to germany on "europe endless" to the emotional drop of "endless endless", you feel like you've just went on vacation to a magical world of happy plastic flowers and scary baby jane movie stars... buy the ticket, take the ride.
A1F3REOOGQ0Q5K	1	1	you people make me sick. any person who gives this album anything below 4 stars doesn't feel the true power of metal. the drum machine is what makes mortician mortician, and there really isn't anything cheesy about it. this album is all about pure, creepy atmosphere (w/ a touch of cheez). the songs are a bit slow and basic at times, but in my opinion, simplicity always works better in metal than the bands that try WAY too hard. this is my personal favorite by mortician and it holds a very special place in my heart. it also reminds me of chinese food. "oooo!"
A1F3UKAR85DASX	1	1	This is one of the best albums ever! The songs and lyrics are amazing! I can't say anything you haven't heard from earlier reviews, just keep this in mind: If you don't have it, GET IT!
A1F3UKAR85DASX	0	0	This movie is horrible! The plot, and some of the effects were totally unoriginal. The action scenes were tolerable, but some of the combat was made needlessly complicated for the purposes of looking good. Example: You've got a gun, and invaders are coming in, do you shoot them? No, you start swinging from the chandeliers dodging bullets and kicking the men with guns. What the ...? My friend fell asleep watching this movie! If you want good action, see movies such as Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, all James Bond's etc. The only worse movie I think I've ever seen is....It's taking a while to think of one, so I'll just end it here.
A1F4897HCNIZ25	0	1	One of my top favorite movies. It will keep you laughing.The package was all broken with I received it but I didn't try returining it because the disc was still intact.
A1F4897HCNIZ25	1	1	My 9 year old stepson and his dad have fun attacking me with this. Great buy. I recommend purchasing the 36 pack of extra darts through amazon.
A1F4897HCNIZ25	1	1	I bough this dvd for my 3 year old step daughter. She absolutely loves horses. I thought the dvd was a great price for having 39 episodes. I previewed them on youtube first. It seems like a cute show.
A1F4G6VNUQA7AK	0	1	Nothing in this novel is profound. Nothing in this novel is redeeming. Nothing in this novel inspires, puzzles, or educates. It is the ramblings of nothingness. Where feelings of the moment have a higher priority than values, morals, standards, virtues or ethics which, by the way, were nowhere to be found in the main character's daily struggles as an individual growing up -- only feelings.There was a little trace of regret, and only then because of its inconvenience to Lee herself, but there was no trace of shame or guilt in Lee."Where these is yet shame, there may in time be virtue" Dr. Johnson
A1F4G6VNUQA7AK	1	1	If you are looking for a history of India 1857 and the sepoy mutiny then this is a wonderful resource. The author lets you know from the beginning that this is going to be a British view, you also know that the source material is from that time, and British as well. So for you who insist on your learning of history to be revisionistic, politically correct, biased free and terms cleansed of their hatred and prejudice to protect your sensitivities, don't blame the author, you should have known from the first chapter this was not for you.This is a record of the (mostly) British people who lived through that time, in their own words and thoughts, about their deeds and the deeds of others with all the hopes and fears and the hatred and vitriol one would expect after living through and witnessing the horror. Importantly, this tells of ordinary people who become villians or cowards but mostly it is of heroes, male and female who gave their lives to protect others, or who survived under condition of siege or imprisonment, or in escaping the horror. There are important personal histories kept alive in this book. All this is framed by the historical event itself.
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	1	1	I own this book and have for many years. It is true that many of the songs are not actually in the keys of the songs the Beatles did them in, but they were meant for EASY guitar playing and not a lot of complex chords. Also, if you don't like the key that the chords are used in, in a particular song than use a "Capo" which will put the same chords in a different key to your liking and voice range. That way you don't lose the simplicity of the chords and yet you can then sing them in the key you desire and possibly as the Beatles really did. Once again I cannot emphasize the value of this great songbook. You can actually PLAY the notes along with the chords for a solo. Buy this songbook before it goes out of print entirely. You'll be so glad you did.
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	0	1	It is amazing to me how the liberal Lutheran church organization allows liberal woman ministers and Gay ministers to publicly attack the evangelical ministers who stand for the gospel and reaching the lost for Christ. One wonders how how this woman was even allowed to be ordained a minister when the the bible clearly says the the Bishop should be the husband of one wife and woman are NOT permitted to teach in the Christian church. Also one needs to ask Barbara, how an infant is truly born again without faith in the gospel? So much for Lutheran liberal soterology.But to the book. Barbara would have you believe Paul taught a resurrection for both the good and the bad, but the truth is Paul the apostle taught only a catching away for the dead IN CHRIST and not for the wicked. Barabara Rossing needs to reread I Thessalonians a little more carefully. Also Barbara also needs to read early church fathers more carefully such as Justin Martyr. The early fathers held to a literal millennium where Christ would reign IN JERUSALEM for 1,000 years. A fact Barabara the Lutheran woman minister conveniently overlooks. Also Barbara Rossing' Jewish bigotry is apparant by dismissing any prophectic future for national Israel, when all one has to do is look to the middle east today and see national Israel is indeed a thriving nation today and has been since 1948. One wonders how all these jews could have returned to their national homeland unless God had a provential hand in it? Of course Barbara Rossingapparentprop hecticJewsprovincial and liberal Lutheran ministers will say, oh it was just allowed for them by the British Balfor act.Barbara RossingBalfour only purpose in having her book published was to trash gospel preaching evangelical ministers and try to convince her public that liberal Lutheranism is indeed the correct religion of the day, infant baby baptism and all along with ordaining woman and gays for the ministry
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	1	1	I have seen every movie of Predators, whether the first one or the Alien vs Predator Requiem. This movie to me is excellent and Brody the lead man plays an excellent role. The movie follows a parallel role of the very first Predator movie not knowing who or what is in the jungle as their enemy.The script writers added more about the predator creatures culture. They have a big predator and and a smaller predator in this one.But both predators are cool and toughest enemies to defeat in the jungle, especially with their cloaking device and laser guns. They are just plain awesome.The graphics are very well done.It really seems like the human team are really there fighting in their worst nightmare, the predators. The one thing that was weak, was who dropped the human team on this distant planet anyway and I saw no way they could get off in the end of the movie. So it was pretty much two wounded mercenaries limping off into the sunset for an ending.It left you hanging.Other than that I loved it.
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	0	0	Morrison has an agenda set forth in his book that neither the apostles, including Paul or Christians personally observed the Sabbath or Sunday. Morrison only believes Jesus and the Jews did at that time period.To me this is incredible, seeing that the apostles ALL were natural Jews from birth.I would like to ask Mr Morrison when did Jesus ever instruct his 12 apostles to abandon the Sabbath altogether and only go into the synagogues to witness the good news of Jesus? When? Also Morrison states that there were no Christians living then who observed the Sabbath day? Mr Morrison, did you forget about Lydia? Mr Morrison's whole purpose in his book is to say no day of the week is really important for Christians to observe at all. This book is just terrible scriptural apologetics
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	0	1	Dr Ruckman's books are 60% filled with hateful language towards other bible commentators and bible translators, so much so he is obsessed with his bitterness. He should just give his OWN personal commentary on his books and quit bashing everyone.
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	1	1	Mr Baker does a great job of defending the Hyper Dispensational position although I do not agree with him, especially on his take of the great commission of Matthew 28:19
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	1	1	When I opened the book from its mailer package I was pleasantly surprised at it's light weight. The original book in print by Adventist printing presses is large and heavy. Also, because of the large print it is very easy on the eyes to read. I do not know if this edition is abridged or not but it does seem it has less volume in content.I may be wrong on that? I have the hardback edition which is constructed very nicely and will last for years. In conclusion if you really want a fuller understanding of church history, the conflict between Satan and God, then this is a wonderful book that will truly enlighten your understanding. It is very enjoyable and scriptural as well. I recommend this book highly
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	0	0	This a low budget movie with a no name cast.Everything about this movie sucked. Amazon wants to charge people for garbage movies just to make money
A1F4JQCWE9YA3V	1	1	I know a lot of the young generation would not bother to watch any old black n white TV westerns because of color TV shows and modern tastes. But for the over 50 crowd Rawhide was and is the greatest TV western series ever produced and acted. Many viewers loved Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood as the main stars, but truth be known, each of the other actors of the supporting cast were excellent as well and contributed to making each story as if you were actually living in those hard times of pushing cattle through rough country, fighting Indians, rustlers and even tag along gunfighters. The cook Wishbone acted by Paul Brineger will make you smile as well and he did seem like a crusty old drovers cook. The DVDs present each series in full screen high definition as well. If you want the best of good old western stories buy them while they last.
A1F4ZXTJSFUKBA	1	1	This is my second Vanishing Point pen. My first was a fine nib, and I am very happy with it, but it didn't work very well on copy paper. The paper required too much ink and the fine nib simply would't deliver enough. The medium nib has no such issue. Writing on copy paper is smooth as silk, and even better on my Moleskine planner. The pen feels fantastic in the hand, the color is great, and Noodlers ink goes very well with the pen.The retractable nib means you'll never lose a cap. The pen writes immediately every time, so there's no drying problem due to no cap. A small door closes when the nib is retracted keeping the nib safe and unexposed to air.The pen comes with an ink cartridge and a reservoir for using with fountain pen ink. The instructions for filling the reservoir aren't terribly clear, but it does work once you figure it out. Drop the nib into the ink all the way up to the shaft so the shaft is partially submerged and twist the filler all the way closed then open. It's a bit messy, so have some paper towels ready to clean up the nib and shaft. Then go write something. And enjoy every minute of writing.If you're looking for a great fountain pen, this is it.
A1F4ZXTJSFUKBA	1	1	I bought one of these in February of the prior year for my fish pond, and it worked great for a full year before getting weaker. It still worked, but wasn't pumping as much water as I needed. I bought a second one in March of this year to replace the previous one. The new pump is a bit quieter than the old one, and performs just as well. I'm planning to try and take the old pump apart and replace the vanes inside it as I'm confident they are simply worn from constant use.This is a great pump for fish ponds and the price is hard to beat. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that the power cord is very short (12 inches at best) and bare. You'll need to either attach a plug onto the wire, or hard-wire the pump into a junction box during installation.
A1F5BPQTFJ2TUP	1	1	In an ideal world, a person approaching a new language would be able to choose between introductions written for a) the dabbler, b) the amateur enthusiast, or c) the scholar. A dabbler may be a traveler off on a short European vacation. This person wants the basics: a little cultural background and some useful phrases. A dabbler is put off by dense linguistic jargon. An amateur enthusiast makes a bigger commitment. She or he has an interest in languages and remembers the basics of English grammar from school. They're not just looking for language candy; they'll eat the language broccoli too.But the scholar... those addicts to obscure points of grammar and tongue-twisting phonologies, the scholar would feel cheated by a language book that didn't include references to things like gnomic aspects or velar fricatives or the hortatory subjunctive. (You know who you are!)But this is not an ideal world, and the market for Anglo-Saxon primers is so small that we have to expect publishers to try to find the one book that will meet the needs of the many. Baker's "Introduction to Old English", in my opinion, does a very fine job. I think it's the best book of its kind on the market today.
A1F5BPQTFJ2TUP	1	1	There is no other book like this available. It is the only resource of its kind devoted to nuanced emotional expressions in Japanese. And by embedding the material in examples from movies and television shows, it is also something of a survey of pop culture. I agree with the reviewers who say it isn't for beginners, but I believe even high intermediate students would find it useful and fascinating.
A1F5BPQTFJ2TUP	0	1	Pimsleur is like a car that can go from zero to 20 instantly. Not bad, right? Problem is, the speed of this car tops out at 25.I bought Pimsleur's beginning Arabic course based on their ubiquitous animated ad that promises that in just ten days using Pimsleur's method for 30 minutes a day, "with no textbook, no grammar drills, no classes, no flashcards, and without studying any vocabulary at all" I could speak a "perfect, accent-free" foreign language. And this method has been "used by 25 million ecstatically happy people around the world."Does Pimsleur live up to this promise? No, not even close. Do any of us think "accent-free" language in ten days is a rational goal? I don't think so, but Simon & Schuster tarnishes its own reputation as well as Paul Pimsleur's by making the sort of shameless false claims I thought only existed in late-night infomercials.So the product does not fulfill its promises, but does it work at all? Actually, it does a little. It's not 100% snake-oil. After ten days, I had a short menu of fixed phrases in Arabic such as "Good morning", "Excuse me", "Do you know English?", and "I'm not Syrian, ma'am". (Glad to have that last one. If only I had a nickel for every time women have taken me for a Syrian!) Arabic is an intimidating language and even giving me a short menu of things to say with some verve and confidence is a small win. Is it perfect Arabic? No. Is it accent-free? Who are they kidding? Pimsleur Arabic seems often simply to omit sounds that are problematic for native English speakers: compare how Pimsleur's readers say the word "Arabic" (Arabi) compared to any native speaker you can hear on Youtube. Pimsleur just ignores an 'ayin at the beginning. In short, even the goal of "accent-free" Arabic is abandoned from the git-go.In conclusion, the product's advertising is so false, I'm a bit surprised no one has sued the publisher. But is it helpful at all? Sort of. But if you want really to master Arabic, you need something with more structure. Arabic is an interesting language that generally attracts curious, intelligent people. I think they would prefer a more intelligent approach.
A1F5RTGIUSJQ66	1	0	I too do not see what the beef other reviewers have with this disc. Out of all other flying discs i have tried with my chocolate lab Shelby the Dogobie 1)lasts the longest 2)is safest on your dogs mouth, gums and teeth 3)flies quite far if you have any kind of adeptness at throwing any other type of flying object. i would not buy another brand.
A1F5RTGIUSJQ66	0	0	i purchased this movie in 2009 only to have the dvd start stopping and skipping about an hour into the movie. amazon.com was helpful enough to send another dvd to replace the defective one. last night i finally got the chance to view the replacement dve. GUESS WHAT!!! it starts stopping and skipping in exactly the same spot as the first copy. i will never be able to see what finally happens.

A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	movie that just when you think you have it figured out, they surprise you. I am a Robert Duvall fan and he is as good as ever as the eccentric Uncle Hub. Michael Caine is fantastic as the odd Uncle Garth but he can't quite exchange his english dialect for a Texas accent. The entire family will enjoy the story of a young boy (Walter) who is left by his irresponisble mother to stay the summer with his two unusual uncles who have just returned after 40 years of being who knows where. As the old coots warm up to Walter, they reveal their unusual past and give Walter the first "stable" home he has ever known. Go see it.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	I have read most of the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell. I have mostly found them a good read being a fan of historical fiction. I was hesitant to read a book on &quot;Aurthurian England&quot; for I have found the hackneyed legends sorrounding Aurthur's myth tiresome. But WOW this is an incredible novel that brings to life a possible historical basis of this sparsely documented time in British history. It is a rich and exciting portrayal of Arthur and plausible explanations of the people and events that brought about the legend of Excalibur. I must say it is the best of his novels I have read so far and am excited about continueing with the series. I have found that those who have not enjoyed this book have been looking for a fantasy novel of a traditional sense about Avalon etc. This is not it.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	When one goes to a Disney movie now, basically you want to know how it compares to other Disney movies you have seen in the past....how is the animation, is the story any different, will I enjoy it or just get the Mickey Mouse kind of deja vu. Disney seems to rely on the ultimate tragedy of losing a parent or love one to bring about a quick need for the viewer to care about the character(s). That aside I enjoyed a the storyline relying on Native beliefs and a general positive message about the world and animals that they coexist. The animation was nothing beyond the ordinary and the music leaves nothing to hum about on the way home but is definitely worth your while to see in the movie theater.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	Out of 77 reviews so far, I think only 3-4 are from someone who has ACTUALLY seen the movie.I have read these books many times and my expectations have been high at all three of these movies. This movie made to match the third novel in The Trilogy, met my expectations and then some. The emotional bonds the character's had with each other holds strong through the storytelling and the battle scenes are spectacular. The director does well to show Frodo's tortured soul as he reaches his destination in Mordor. I think those who have read the book know how stirring the ending can be and the feeling as if you are parting from long time friends. Some things I might have wanted to know before I went were: there is not an epilogue that matches the book per se, but it doesn't detract from the story....most likely it would have been very anticlimatic as it is somewhat in the book. Being a movie around three and a half hours, I expected an intermission but there is none so don't drink that 24 ounce coke like I did or you will miss some of the movie running to the bathroom.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	-Easy User Interface. Plug and save for your compact flash card without having to turn the unit on if you are in a hurry.-Nicely designed exterior and 3.5 inch display.-The screen resolution in review mode wont allow you to determine sharpness absolutely but definitely will allow you to review pictures and show them to friends.-There are smaller units out there but this is a nice compromise for size and functionality.-This unit is a hard drive,so don't expect to take this running when you listen to you MP3 player.-It has good sound quality when using headphones.-My only complaint is the &quot;case&quot; is just a felt bag, I was expecting something more durable.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	After trying two language programs before this and being highly disappointed in their performance I finally put out the money for this program. It is comprehensive and I have found it very valuable in it's method of teaching the Italian language. I highly recommend it.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	1	The $2999.00 sale price at Fry's Electronics made this one hard to resist. We knew that some reviews mentioned on the Internet stated that there were red hue problems in the flesh tones. Those concerns turned out to be true. Faces were way too red, making news anchor-people look like they had been out in the sun too long. We really did not want to return it for the price was great compared to others we had seen in this size range. We just could not tolerate it considering the amount of money demanded for this type of television, so it was returned.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	so you may fast forward through the slow parts. The battle scenes are good, not great after LOTR set the standard. Many slow scenes with repetitive dialogue about the meaning of war, what is killing good for, etc. There are gratuitous scenes of Brad Pitt's physique for those who would get a thrill out of it.There is very little historical accuracy, realizing it would take a 22 hour movie to try and get it right. You would hope they would at least try some of the easy historical depictions...like it took 9 years to get to the Trojan Horse, Ajax commits suicide after Achilles death, Achilles sends Patroclus to fight for him, not the way depicted, but directorial laziness prevented any of historically similar scenes from being attempted.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	If you are a fan of the Bernard Cornwell Series, "Enemy of God" you will enjoy this movie. It is not the mythical/legendary version of his tale but the historical possibility of how his legend may have come about. It depicts a very small time frame when the Romans were abandoning Briton and the Saxons were taking advantage of that fact and engaging the Britons/Celts that were left behind and Arthur's deeds in becoming their king.-Excellent battle scenes that are not too graphic for younger folks.-Kiesha Knight is darn sexy as Guinevere-Battle and key scenes are dramatized ala Armageddon which corny as it may be, I liked very much-Clive Owen, is well cast as Arthur.-Cinematography is well done.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	has made a vacuum THE major appliance in our home. We own two large dogs, a cat and two guinea pigs and vacuuming once a day at least is a must. In 8 years we've owned an Electrolux, Hoover Windtunnel, Eureka Whirlwind and finally the Dyson Animal. This is a fabulous vacuum and the Dyson has the best suction by far and is great for hardwoods but to temper the "out of this world" reviews, I must say it doesn't pick up the fur out of the carpet as well as the Eureka. I ran the Dyson extensively over a specific area of carpet then ran the Eureka. The Eureka was always able to extract additional fur (Dyson picks up little after the Eureka). I believe the agitator/roller doesn't reach as far into the carpet as the Eureka. Of course the Eureka doesn't do the additional items nearly as well as the Dyson so if you don't want to own two vacuums, you have to compromise somewhere. If the Dyson Animal wasn't specifically marketed for animal owners I would have given it 5 stars.As for the Hoover...even though Consumer Reports rates it as the top vacuum (that's why we got it)...it is almost worthless on major/minor fur problems.The Electrolux has average performance, weak when it comes to animal hair and has a big price tag
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	I have been an armchair AT enthusiast for years and have read most of the AT books out there. This is definitely a journal of almost every day Bill Schuette has on the AT. This is a nuts and bolts type of story, telling you about almost every part if the trail and what it takes and what it's like to do it. I have read books that generalize large parts of the trail and spend more time on the spiritual, philosophical part of why they are doing the trail but this is not it. I think I enjoyed this as much as others is I got to hear about parts of the trail that most books seem to skip and it is a timely account from the year 2000. Another is he finishes the trail unlike Bill Bryson's fractional account, "A Walk in the Woods"I recommend Mic Lowther's book, "Walking North" for a nice combination of trail accountability and philosophy.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	It's a science fiction novel!, no a fantasy novel, no a mystery....religous thriller......oh for cryin' out loud. The only thing worse than a book that is just downright lousy is one that starts out strong, draws you in then takes a plummet all the way....well to hell.If just one of those themes delivered anything of quality it might have been worth slogging through Jeff Long's long winded dialogue, chapters and weak plotting. Even skipping to the end will leave you with an incredibly absurd ending that comes out of nowhere with no support of the preceding pages.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	I've used Aperture since it's initial release. It won out over Adobe's product only because it became available first and I had a mighty need to organize my photos and work flow. My frustrations with the initial release of the Aperture 1.x series was non-intuitive menu items, viewing problems and sluggishness when downloading photos much less while running photoshop or some other memory hog. Aperture 2.0 is a pleasant surprise by a company that seems to listen to their customers. The menu items are much easier to understand and use and the performance on my Macbook Pro is not perfect but much much faster.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	0	If you've read a lot of science fiction or fantasy it is so tremendously hard to find plot lines that are not hackneyed to death, characters who aren't cookie cutter and writing that just doesn't keep your interest. This series is a real find and brings excitement and fine writing that engages you.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	It's always interesting when the subject matter, plot and characters are the same but the writers change mid-story. The first book by Dan Abnett had superior plot development and interesting dialogue. Moving to the second book the plot dissolved into a Zombie novel with little to no creativity in the battle scenes. The dialogue sounds like it was written in a middle school creative writing class. I'll move to the third book more hopeful.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	Functional item that I'm using to switch in my home for security cameras. Solid and works great. Casing is reminiscent of a radio shack kit I had in high school so if your going to have it visible that might be a consideration but otherwise a great item.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	headsets with my cellphone, bluetooth and otherwise, and found them lacking. My biggest problem was sound quality and connectivity while on the move and the loud road noise I get in my Scion. While reluctant to use a wired headset with a boom, I relented after reading reviews here. The normal user won't want to walk around with this on and you may get some looks while in the car. It's been a great product and a heck of a deal for the price.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	These bowls have a solid look and feel, nice consistent color and have not had any cracking or chipping as of yet. I've banged these on other dishes in the dishwasher by accident, my pottery barn bowls would have chipped immediately, but they have endured. Good product.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	1	I may have received a lemon but the heater stays on for a unreliable amount of time and it seems the safety thermostat kicks in and it shuts off. The inside of our house is around 55 degrees and we wished to use this for localized heating which when it is on works great.One shortcoming when it is on is it is so bright compared to other radiant heaters that if your trying to read or work in the vicinity it can be blinding and should be considered for what you are going to use it.I'm afraid we are going to return this to Amazon.What does work great and reliably is the Presto Parabolic Heater which we will be buying another of soon.Presto HeatDish Parabolic Heater Plus Footlight
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	Yes, you make pancakes etc. with this grill but I use it to create was artwork. This is only relevant because I have it on 6 hours a day 5 days a week. This would put any heating device to a true test and I've had it for about 5 months with no variation in heat or breakdown of the surface. An excellent product.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	Watching the videos of this item being used, I couldn't' resist and I bought it. I didn't read the fine print though and it needed a heat regulator to go with it as well. Well after I bought the item and used it I found that it was not easy to use and was tedious when switching colors. It is basically a soldering iron that someone has welded the flow basin onto. The biggest problem I had is that the pointed flow regulator at the bottom of the basin, if you had any wax layers at all, would melt that layer as the wax was laid down on the painting. This is great if that is what you are trying to achieve but useless if you just want a single line of encaustic medium. Too much to spend on an item that you may use seldom at best.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	I'll start out to say that Greg Mortenson is an unusual and amazing man. I wont reiterate what hundreds of people have said about his truly astounding effort to help the children of the Balti region of Pakistan.That said, the writing in this book looks like it was written by a high school student in English class. It is dry and the mundane dialogue is hard to take as well as the facts left out that confuse the reader. It sounds like he is dictating from Greg's memory but hasn't checked with other sources to get a deeper perspective on what he has done and is very dry in it's recall of this mans life.Missing facts: Greg is incredibly poor at the beginning of the book, living in his car but travels and climbs Himalayan peaks (It cost around 40,000 dollars at the time just to get up K2 alone) during that time. Leaves you to assume that folks have paid his way but how can you just blow over those events in his life in one paragraph.(Spoiler)------Why doesn't he go ballistic when the supplies are missing in Skurdu and travels for a full day with Changazi who misguided the supplies before questioning him? Sounds petty but it's only the beginning of so many problems with this book.--Greg handed the author a list of his enemies for him to "look up" and discuss why they were enemies, I assume, but who are they and why? We never clearly get to see which considering his efforts would have been truly interesting to see.******* I would have loved to have read a rich, well put together book about Greg Mortenson and theamazing things he accomplished but this book greatly disappointed me.********>>>>>>>I had a feeling. It was just too much about him. He seemed to be stuck in a type of PHILANTHROPIC NARCISSISM. Doubtful small facts lead to doubts about the whole. Now you have to doubt if he has helped the people like he has claimed. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	This book was recommended to me because I am a ravenous reader of historical fiction. I found this book more of a romance type novel It seemed to be presented like the "history plays" we use to put together in elementary school. You would take a time period and each class would take a major or minor event in that time period and act it out. We'd go to the library, get the gist of it and contrive the characters on how we thought they would be at that time. What you got was a play with shallow characters, flat dialogue and dubious accuracy on how it all went down. If you love a good romance novel than this might be for you but if you're more a solid historical fiction person than this may not be the novel for you.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	in the way of WWII escape stories by the time I was 20. 29 years later I stumbled across this gem and enjoyed it immensely. Great detail and description on P.R. Reid's time in Colditz and his eventual escape.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	0	0	Left aglow by "True Grit" I soon followed with "The Dog of the South" The first half of the book had a lot of promise while Ray Midge made his way to British Honduras but became bogged down with numerous similar rambling characters and pointless dialogue. I was left feeling that most of the individuals needed way to much to relate their less than interesting and extensive backgrounds to Midge. The dialogues and realizations ostensibly from a sense the character is either inebriated, drug imbued or just plain dumb. The non-sensical aspect of some of the conversations are maddening.This may have made sense relating to this time period that brings about a curiosity in the reader that soon wears off, It just gets hard to deal unless you like to swim around in a philosophical molasses of individuals that gets you there eventually.
A1F68F25W7SI1E	1	1	I'm challenged when it comes to sharpening knives. I Had bought a lesser Chef's Choice many years ago and I was able to get a pretty good edge but just not that sharp of sharp blades I like when I cutting vegetables much less meat or poultry. I tried a whetstone but was not able to keep a consistent angle to the stone not to mention the tediousness of using it.When I received the sharpener I followed the instructions to the letter I was able to obtain the edge I've been looking for with my Henckel chef's knives. I even use it for my nice pocket knives that I had all but given up on keeping a sharp blade of any kind and it works excellently without the loss of too much metal.

A1F6GB003BOKUK	0	0	Many of us -- certainly myself -- wistfully think from time to time, "I should be a writer." I'm not sure exactly what solace to take from finding that Michael Crichton -- a hugely successful writer -- seems wistfully to think, "I should be a scientist."This is a Bad book, with a capital 'B.' It is truly shameful. Mr. Crichton has an appendix to his book called, "Why Politicized Science is Dangerous." Right -- it is better that we should completely skip the science and go straight to the politics, as Mr. Crichton has done in this book."State of Fear" closely resembles another propanda work (and Bad book), "Atlas Shrugged," by Ayn Rand. It has the same pubescent affinity for the ironic, the iconclastic, while in truth seeking out no more than acceptance and appreciation. Michael Crichton wants you to like him, though for being a thoughtful and thorough intellect, and not for being a hack novelist.But Michael Crichton is not a thoughtful and thorough intellect; he IS a hack novelist.It was almost physically painful for me to read the section where super-professor and secret agent John Kenner -- Crichton's John Gault; I wonder if he was not involved in the romantic threads of the novel as a matter of Crichton's jealousy of his female characters -- lectured (lectured!) some poor sap (it doesn't matter whom) on the unforgivability of climate scientists having missed a predicted temperature change by 300%, comparing it to a commercial airline or moonshot flight lasting longer than scheduled. Hello?!Predicting the temperature of the atmosphere of a planet is essentially a problem of first predicting the total heat energy of the planet, and then predicting its disposition within the ground, the seas, and the atmosphere. This is not a simple matter of being unable perfectly to predict prevailing winds, as in Crichton/Kenner's stupid comparisons. A much more appropriate example would be comparing a temperature change prediction with a prediction of the change in flight times of a particular commercial flight or a particular moonshot between now and ten years in the future, reflecting both technological advancements and the uncertain weather affecting the flight. If we predicted that the flights would be an hour shorter, and they ended up being only twenty minutes shorter, would we question our premise of tecnological advancement increasing flight speeds? And yet Crichton suggests that by missing THE CHANGE in temperature by 300%, climate predition has shown itself to be worthless. Among sensible people, it should be held as profoundly impressive that the total energy of the earth system could be predicted to within what is likely a very small fraction of 1%. And this is why scientists, and not hack novelists, should be refered to for opinions on scientific matters.Aside from having no clue how to interpret numbers, what I think is the most shameful thing about this awful novel and Crichton's apparent personality disorder comes late in the book, when he has a Solomon Island rebel group engaging in cannibalism. Yes, that word was 'cannibalism.'Again, some sort of late adolescence seems to have directed Crichton from a reasonable rejection of the Rousseau-an concept of the nobel savage to a reprehensible adoption of a pre-modern concept of primitive societies as lacking even the most basic tenets of morality. Crichton points to the protective, uplifting aspects of modern culture, but then he abandons them: an accusation of cannibalism is about the most ham-handed of all pre-modern slurs underpinning racism and other notions of superiority.Let me be clear on this: there has been cannibalism in human history. However, it has by all accounts always occurred very much with full recognition of the power of all that it suggests -- the actual cannibals of history ate other humans not because they did not respect the magnificence of humanity, but precisely because they DID respect the magnificence of humanity. But for Crichton, cannibalism is just a trip to a food buffet, plus unimaginable cruelty.So this is Michael Crichton's latest book: a hackneyed effort at science-ism, cloaked in the 'manly' quality of rebellion and iconclasm (although where is this mythical land where 'everyone knows' that global warming is happening? And who is the President on that planet?), and infused with a desire to be liked for the 'right' reasons. Michael, Michael -- there are some people in the world whom you should NOT want to like you.
A1F6I0EAJCS8MI	1	1	Had a 5 year old Linksys combo wireless router/modem that was flaking out. Decided to upgrade to latest-greatest I could afford and am very happy. Installation was a breeze, just follow the instructions and most of the work is done for you. There's a lot of tweaking available afterwards if you need it.NOTE: seen at least one review detailing issues with Motorola SB6120 SURFboard modem. I purchased both and installed at the same time and have not had any issues.
A1F6I0EAJCS8MI	0	1	Very good past experience with Gilmour, a impulse sprinkler I've been using for years and great customer service including sending replacement parts for something I fully admitted to "weedeating."Upon dropping and breaking my previous Gilmour I decided to get another and picked out this more accessorized version over the simpler, all-metal one. The plastic hose connector collar split, blowing the hose off the sprinkler before I could even get it to the grass. I was even using the quick connector that came with the sprinkler. Took this back and p/u the all-metal which is presently watering my yard.Quite concerned that this may be a move toward "price-point" products for Gilmour which would be a sad, sad development.
A1F6I0EAJCS8MI	1	1	bought the bucket that these inserts fit during one of our home improvement projects. Really liked the ease of use--the bucket has nice handle, magnetic brush holder, good size, and these inserts make clean-up or short-term storage easy. Of course when I went back to the big-box store where I purchased the originals, they no longer carried that model or the inserts, only poor knock-offs. Very pleased to track down the inserts here so I can keep using the bucket.
A1F6M3MYMIWIP2	1	1	I got this from Amazon in December 2005 and I placed it outside my bedroom window since then. So far it has worked wonderfully. Despite rainy, windy and hot sunny days this useful device remains remarkable well preserved (looks like new) and it has never lost its colors nor its sticking features. I have never touched it again after I placed it at the window. The numbers are large enough so I can even check the whether while still lying on the bed. In Mexico we do not use the Fahrenheit scale for the whether but the Celsius, and this thermometer has both. In my home town the whether varies so much during a year (-5 C in winter upto +45 C in summer) and I have never had any problem: this thermomether is always accurate. Try to hide it from the sun, but if you can't, then just wait until the sun does not hit it directly to check the whether. UPDATE: August 2010: Still working like a charm and looking like new. I have not yet removed it from the window, it actually does not keep dust or dirt. It has been attached for almost 5 years. Yes, it looks & works like the first day.

A1F6M3MYMIWIP2	0	1	Product: 5 stars (if it is the redesigned). But 1 star because you can get this item for free, so why selling it?My husband bought the Bose In-Ear Headphones less than a year ago. Though he looooves the brilliant sound of the music, he had many troubles with the silicon tips, which fall too often. Since he is a daddy of a 2 y.o. that also loves music, you can imagine how soon he lost the silicon tips included in his purchase. He even considered to glue them, as my mother actually did (successfully, as she told me), but all his pairs were already unmatched. Looking for those on Amazon site I came across with a great advise from another reviewer (in similar product), who warned on not to buy the silicon tips, because on its website Bose was sending replacements for free. He did not include the link and it was not easy to find it, but I actually found it and he was right.Bose acknowledged the poor design of these silicone tips, that's why they are correcting their mistake (if everyone do that...!). So, they do send a "Complete set of silicone ear tips (S, M and L)", well redesigned (apparently with a feature that impede the tips from falling) and by means of a free UPS 3 or 5-day delivery. Even provide a tracking number so you can trace the package. I must say that the items are well packaged.You can also register for a free "Stability enhancement accessory", as I did. My husband is very happy with his new absolutely-free accessories, and enjoying the improved features of these little things. And so is my mom: I also ordered the two items for her as well. Bose's website says that they reserve the right to limit the quantities, but as far as I am concerned, I placed two orders without a problem, the two of them for both items.[...]However, if they change this link, try these words in their web search: "complimentary" or "replacement". They'll do the job.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THEM if you have already paid for this fine product. Just exercise your right to a proper consumer attention. Bose is great providing that.

A1F6NH6E85GG3Q	1	1	If you're a diehard ECW fan, you WILL and MUST buy this DVD, and probably already have done so. If you're more of a casual ECW fan, like myself, this is a DVD to rent instead of buying. The documentary is very good. But once I was done watching it, after burning $25 to do so, I thought to myself, "hmmm, I can't see myself ever wanting to watch that again." It's not worth dropping more than $15 on if you're a casual ECW fan. The only problem I had with the documentary is that it jumps from topic to topic without creating a detailed time line of what happened when; Instead, it jumps from wrestler to wrestler, documenting the stamp each man had on the company. Days later, I recall nothing that motivates me to want to watch the DVD again except the closing quote from Paul Heyman, which is so incredibly inspirational and clearly defines him as an individual. I thought it's placement was well done by the editors.
A1F6NH6E85GG3Q	1	1	If you're a Ric Flair mark, like me, this is a phenomenal read. I read it from cover to cover as soon as I bought it. It was so good, I was reading it while driving! Bad move, I know, but I couldn't put it down. I loved reading about the old territory days and how things worked behind the scenes, and then about his problems with WCW management. Honestly, I think any old school fan who is familiar with Flair will enjoy this book because it gives a nice look back to the days when there was a wrestling promotion in every major city. And if you're new school, and don't even know what the NWA is, I think you may get a nice history lesson. I would highly reccomend this book above any other to a wrestling fan.
A1F6Y5VCLSZR1D	1	1	Your Arabic Made Easy program is a joy to work with. After studying Arabic (self taught) for a few years, I could read Arabic on a second grade level, but could never keep a spoken conversation going.My Egyptian friend thinks I'm a genius to be learning so fast - this is really excellent software!

A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	0	1	This really is more of a beginners book and not one I would say is for a system administrator. In addition, like every linux book I have found so far, it is distro specific. I will continue to search for a good linux book which spends most of it's time at the command prompt using universal commands instead of the GUI of a specific distro employing a specific GUI.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	0	1	It's possible this is a great book for theologians to read from cover to cover but I don't have the credentials to judge that and this book has little value to anyone else.From the description, I believed I would easily be able to look up the different creeds and understand the basic philosophies. This is simply not possible. The book is laid out in a time line approach and not indexable by creed. It's also a massive book with a lot of dry, arcane information so a cover to cover read won't appeal to the casual reader.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	1	1	There isn't a whole lot you can say about a memory stick. I have 2 of this model and both have worked reliably for a few years with no issues ever. 1 in a Palm PDA and 1 in a digital camera.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	1	0	I disagree with the opinion that only people who know nothing about security would get anything out of this book. I am network infrastructure engineer for routers and switches, have past experience with Microsoft OS's, and have a security+ certification. I am NOT a security expert or computer forensics specialist but I have some security knowledge and I really enjoyed this book.You won't become a security expert reading this book but It's an interesting and educational read for someone with some technical background who would like a surface level introductory. For me, this was a pleasure/entertainment read and I wasn't looking to use it as the basis for a career as a security expert.I do like that the author provides real examples that you can try out yourself to explore further.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	1	1	i've worked in a couple of pizza places so i've worked with a lot of peels. i definitely prefer wood over metal but wooden peels always get torn up from cutting on them and also crack over time. this is hands down the most durable peel i've ever seen. the thin design makes it light weight and easy to wield, the surface is generally slick so sliding pizzas on/off is a breeze, clean-up is a snap, and after all the use i've put it through it still doesn't have a scratch and looks brand new. if i had one complaint it is that the surface is a little to slick and you have to be careful not to push the pizza off it when using a rolling cutter. i have not experienced any of the smell other people have complained about.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	1	1	This all-metal coat hook is excellent. The parts seem solid and durable and I have a hard time imagining it ever breaking under normal use. The pricing was very reasonable when compared to other available products on Amazon despite the others mostly being made of or containing plastic. Did I mention this is ALL metal? The brushed metal body and polished dual coat hooks also look great.
A1F6ZPX50TKGG1	1	1	The write-up on this product is somewhat conflicting and misleading. First, it says "It has the essential tools to clean rifles 0.17 to 0.50 caliber, handguns 0.17 to 0.50 caliber, 410 to 12/10 gauge shotguns, and all in-line muzzleloaders." further down you find "Contains the brushes needed to clean .22, .270, .30, .38, .45 cal. rifles/pistols and 12/10 ga. shotguns." The later is the more important statement. I have a .223 which according to Otis requires the .25 brush. That caliber is well within the .17 to .50 initially described but that brush is not on the brush list. Maybe they got me on a technicality and "tools" refers to the handles and cables, not the brushes. This was my first cleaning kit so I didn't know better until it arrived and I looked at the included chart describing which brushes work with which calibers. This is an awesome little kit but be sure to go to the Otis site first and see what brushes they recommend for you caliber(s) and compare them against the included brushes before assuming this kit will cover your needs out of the box. I ordered the brush I need separately from Otis and just swapped out one of the other calibers I don't use with it and I'm happy but this would have been nice to know before I made the initial purchase.

The author's highly developed writing style as well as his erudition are on full display in this enormous, sprawling epic that ranges from prehistory to the 16th century in what seems to be northern Germany, through the squalors and splendors of Renaissance Rome during the papacy of Leo X Medici, to various epic sea journeys.All sorts of disparate strands are woven together, all ultimately related to the absurd contest between Spain and Portugal over which will be the first country to gratify Pope Leo's whim: to own a rhinoceros to compliment his beloved elephant. The winner will get to divide the recently discovered "New World" to his country's advantage. The story is loosely based on historical fact: Leo did want a rhino, and he set up the competition between the two world powers more for his own amusement than for any serious political purpose.Leo and his court are presented in all their vanity, corruption and obliviousness to the enormous issues facing the papacy at that time. The author is very strong on his presentation of the incredible squalor that surrounded the splendor of the papal court; his picture of Renaissance Rome is one you can smell as well as see.I liked the author's description of Leo's "silly, fun-stuffed head:" a perfect characterization of Giovanni de' Medici, who might be described as a profoundly frivolous man. This is a novel where the characters take time to urinate and defecate, fornicate and masturbate, but only one character ever bathes!Although the prose is often brilliant, it's just as often over-the-top and needlessly elaborated. A less indulgent editor could have insisted the book be trimmed by a good quarter, which would have improved it. But even in its shaggy, overgrown state, it's an impressive achievement.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	Have you ever wondered what it might be like to live* in a major monument--a building considered one of the ten most important in the history of Western architecture? Sally and Carl Gable, an American couple from Atlanta, Georgia, found out when they purchased Villa Cornaro, an imposing structure built in the 1550's as a summer residence for the Venetian aristocrat Giorgio Cornaro. The architect was Andrea Palladio, whose influence dominated Western architecture for three centuries. About two decades after that purchase, the Gables have written a memoir of their experiences as only the sixth owners of this remarkable place in its more than 450 years of existence, and it's among the best books of its kind that I've ever read.This isn't another tiresome memoir of the type popularized by the insufferable Frances Mayes--one of those "I'm rich and I own a villa in Italy and you don't" volumes that drips self-congratulation. Obviously, people who can take on the responsibility of a Palladian villa have to be wealthy, and the Gables consider themselves fortunate to own such a treasure, but what comes through so clearly in their memoir is the enormous sense of responsibility they feel toward Villa Cornaro.They don't see it as a status symbol, a possession to be flaunted. Rather, they see it as "a force of nature," a living entity; they know they're the caretakers of something far more important than themselves. Yes, they enjoy the Villa they inhabit for two months during the spring and another two months during the autumn of each year, but they're also aware that they are entrusted with one of Italy's most precious buildings, and that they have a duty to maintain it and pass it on to their children and grandchildren, just as the original owners did.A gratifying feature of this book is the account of the Gables' efforts to become a part of the life of the town where the Villa is located--the tiny Veneto hamlet of Piombino Dese. When the Gables first arrived in 1987, hardly anyone there spoke English, and Sally and Carl had only a sketchy knowledge of Italian. They could have isolated themselves, spent only a minimal amount of time with the locals and never bothered to learn the language, which is what many Americans do when they buy property in Italy. Instead, they made themselves part of the community, made friends, involved themselves in local issues, and learned Italian and the Venetan dialect spoken in the region.And never* do the Gables display the slightest condescension. Rather than treating the local people as potential servants and providers of services (as Frances Mayes does) they regard them as fellow custodians of a property that is a common heritage.Although neither of the Gables was trained as a scholar, they're both well educated and intelligent people who have made great efforts to learn as much as they can about the Villa--its structural secrets, its place in Palladio's development as an architect, and its relationship to Venetian society in the 16th century. Sally Gable even began doing research on the Cornaro family in the archives of Venice, trying to get a sense of what their lives were like in the 16th century, although she was wise enough to realize that such research, if seriously pursued, could become the work of a lifetime. As a result of their efforts, the Gables become experts on their own property, and can hold their own in the rarified discussions of the eminent scholars who often visit.The writing is engaging, down-to-earth and seasoned with revealing personal anecdotes, as well as lightened with self-effacing humor. The illustrations are mostly photographs the Gables themselves have taken, and they offer glimpses of the Villa as a lived-in home*, rather than an impersonal historical monument. The book is a joy to read.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	To write about a subject as controversial as the Holocaust in Italy without becoming a "partisan" is a rare achievement, but Stille has succeeded in this absorbing book. Ignoring the unsettle-able issue of what Pope Pius XII did or didn't do to help Italian Jews, he instead concentrates on the experiences and fates of five very different Jewish families in various parts of Italy during the 20 years of Fascism, including the last, terrible period of the German occupation.Stille chose his title with care; instances of benevolence and betrayal are woven throughout the stories. There are Christians who risk their lives to save Jewish friends and neighbors; priests and nuns, bishops and cardinals who offer support and sanctuary; stories of Jewish ingenuity and bravery. There are also stories of betrayals on both sides: Christians who betrayed Jews out of greed or anti-Semitism, or in pathetic efforts to save their own or their families' lives. Stille doesn't hesitate to expose Jews who betrayed their own people--a touchy subject many writers would avoid. The result is a book that reveals the complexity of an issue too often over-simplified into Jewish heroes and Italian villains, or heroic Italians and helpless Jews.What makes Stille's book so memorable, however, isn't the author's unusual objectivity; it's the fascinating stories his subjects tell. Stille interviewed many of them, as well as using diaries, letters, published writings and personal papers provided by the families of those no longer living. The book is divided into five sections, one for each family.This is a moving, at times horrifying, but enlightening and engrossing book, full of vivid details of Italian life during a tragic but deeply significant period of Italy's history.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	This historical novel has a lot to recommend it. The author writes very well; her historical research is thorough and presented in a non-pedantic way; the development of her characters is consistently interesting; her descriptions of works of art and architecture are accurate, well-informed and insightful.But despite all these strong points, the books has some really annoying qualities. Why is Leonardo da Vinci called "the Magistro?" There's no such word in either Italian or Latin. Why not just call him "the master," or, if the author insists on using Italian, "il maestro?"My personal preference is for linear writing, so I didn't care for the way the author went backward and forward in time, and sometimes used the present tense and other times the past tense in her prose.And could someone please explain the mysterious "da Vinci code" embodied in the chapter titles? Each chapter title begins with a Roman numeral followed by an asterisk, but the numerals appear in no particular order. Chapter One has an "X," Chapter Three an "XV" and so on. What's this all about?And finally, the title. The book is NOT about Leonardo's (or anybody's) swans; the birds play only a minor role, and the painting of "Leda and the Swan," is mentioned only briefly. Readers are entitled to think, from the title, that the book is principally about Leonardo da Vinci, which it isn't. Perhaps the author or publisher thought that getting Leonardo's famous name into the title would sell more books than the much lesser-known names of Isabella or Beatrice d'Este?
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	This is a most remarkable piece of archival research that recreates the everyday life of a 16th-century Italian aristocrat as he and his family pursue his goal of attaining for him the rank of cardinal in the wholly worldly and corrupt Catholic Church of that era. Using an enormous trove of documents she stumbled upon in the archives of Modena, Hollingsworth brings to vivid and detailed life the world of Ippolito d' Este, one of the sons of the notorious Lucrezia Borgia and her last husband, Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara.In the hands of the wrong writer, this kind of research could be deadly dull--little more than an endless 16th-century shopping list. But in Hollingsworth's hands these "dry" documents come to life, and take the reader into the day-to-day, material world of Ippolito d'Este as no other form of research could do. This is history that takes us from politics and power-seeking all the way to the level of perfumed gloves and crystal urinals, a world of mind-boggling aristocratic affluence and luxury.The author's writing style, which some might consider a bit dull, is appropriate for her subject, in the sense that Ippolito needs no editorializing-- his documents themselves speak louder than anything the author could say about them. In any case, the writing is always competent, and often enlivened with flashes of dry British humor. Her ability to make sense of endless pages of accounts-- and to make the contents of those account books of interest to a modern reader-- is nothing short of masterful.My only criticism is that, among all the illustrations, there doesn't seem to be a single one of Ippolito himself.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	This is a superb re-creation of a complex and colorful era in Italian history. It's so much superior to the average historical novel that I'd be tempted to give it 5 stars, except for one problem: it's simply too long. The action moves at such a ponderous pace that at times I was tempted to skim over the endless political machinations that form a large portion of the dialogue. But I'd even grant the author the necessity of laying out all that political intrigue, if he'd held back just a bit on the ENDLESS and detailed descriptions of clothing! How many times to we have to be told EXACTLY what each of our two dueling duchesses is wearing each time one of them makes an appearance?Beyond those criticisms, however, this is a terrific book. It's rare to find a historical novel where the characters are drawn in such vivid psychological, intellectual and emotional detail. The plot follows the course of Italian history in the late 1400s through the early 1500s via the lives of two aristocrat women, each with a claim to being the Duchess of Milan: Isabella of Aragon and Beatrice d' Este. The latter is married to the character who dominates the novel, despite its title: Lodovico Sforza, called "Il Moro," a man at once ruthless and visionary, cultured and brutal, who is determined to displace his incompetent nephew and become Duke of Milan. In the end he succeeds, briefly, and at a terrible price, only to have the wheel of fortune turn again and send him tumbling down, to end his days in a French prison.The narrative sticks pretty close to the historical record, although Lodovico Il Moro had quite a few more illegitimate children than the novel gives him. All the political deceit, lies, double-dealing and treachery that fill the history of that era, and that are chronicled in such detail here, make one wonder how Italy ever managed to become a unified country!
A1F7V34D43GDHY	0	0	It's difficult to believe that the author of this stiff, amateurishly written novel is a journalist who has written three other novels, After plodding through this one, I certainly wouldn't seek out her other works!Although the emphasis on food was fun and Giuditta the Cook an unusual heroine, the plot is lame; the descriptions and dialogue are awkward, the writing style just about non-existent, and the ending totally flat.After reading some marvelous novels set in the Renaissance, such as Michael Ennis's "Duchess of Milan," or Diane Haeger's "Courtesan," this book in comparison reads more like an effort produced for a college writing class.Don't waste your money on it.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	What a terrific book! I can hardly believe this is by the same author who wrote the totally mediocre "Ruby Ring." Apparently Haeger is much more at home in 16th-century France than in Renaissance Italy. The book is worth reading just for the gorgeous descriptions of castles, clothing and furniture!But it's much more than just a catalogue of everything the aristocrats had that the lower classes did not. The endless, complicated intrigues, betrayals and jockeying for favor and power that went on at the French court are brilliantly and absorbingly narrated. The main characters are each explored in detail, with a psychological insight not often found in historical fiction. Although I LOATHED Catherine de' Medici-- she must be one of the most vicious women who ever lived, and this is BEFORE her involvement in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of French Protestants-- Haeger makes a real attempt to show the deep unhappiness, humiliations and disappointments that lay behind Catherine's horrible and cruel behavior. The same with King Francois I's mistress, Anne d'Heilly: Haeger makes her another monster of cruelty, but also shows the insecurity of her position as the king's "favourite," and her growing desperation as the king's health fails and she realizes that her own fall is inevitable.I was not bothered at all by Henri's young age when he first becomes involved with Diane. That was an era when girls were often married off at 13 to men more than twice their age, so why shouldn't a youth of 14 have an affair with a woman more than twice HIS age? Think of Lorenzo de' Medici, who had a mistress when he was 16 (admittedly she was only 3 years, and not 16 years, his senior); presumably he had a bit of practice in previous years, no doubt with Florentine courtesans ten or more years older than him.) People were considered grown up at a much younger age in past centuries.My one complaint is that the author makes Diane de Poitiers just a bit too good to be true. In Haeger's portrayal, the woman not only preserves her beauty intact into late middle age, but also seems never to have had a single moment in her life when her behavior was less than noble and perfect. That can get wearing, especially as everyone around her, including Henri, the love of her life, has human failings and moments of weakness.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	This is by far the best CD of Italian Renaissance music that I've ever encountered, and I've listened to a LOT of them! Most performance ensembles take a reverential, almost religious approach to 15th-century music, whether the music is of a religious nature or not. The result is that so many performances are deadly dull. No wonder most people don't like the music of this period.But this recording is different. The performances are lively and sometimes raucous and the rhythms irresistible. The songs make you want to get up and dance!Most of the songs were written for performance during Carnival, although, despite the CD's title, only one is definitely by Lorenzo de' Medici. There's a booklet with the texts, in the original Italian, as well as French and English translations, and an excellent introduction to the music as well. The texts are full of hilariously gross double-ententres: no matter what the song pretends to be about-- it's really about sex.The exception to this rule are the three songs from the era of the fanatical reforming monk Savonarola: these "Carnevale del Crocifisso" songs are as pious as the secular songs are ribald, and they form a nice contrast to the "carnal" Carnival ditties.If you buy one disc of Renaissance music-- buy this one!
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	A novel so wonderful I WISH I'D WRITTEN IT MYSELF! This is historical fiction at its best, with the gaps in the record filled in by an intelligent and well-informed imagination.What a tremendous amount of research must have gone into making it seem as if no research went into it at all. The novel is written in the first person by Mozart's wife Constanze, who looks back on her tumultuous years with the greatest genius in the history of music. Waldron captures Constanze's voice so convincingly that we see Mozart through her eyes, in reverse, so to speak: not the god-like musical immortal, but the flawed and all-too-mortal man. His music is far in the background; his daily life of food, sex (a LOT of sex), chamber-pots, cats, dogs, birds, horses, children, money-scrounging, endless carousing and heavy drinking is in the foreground.The Mozart of this novel is about as irresponsible a man as God ever made: incapable of holding onto his money; almost criminally negligent in his failure to support his wife and the series of children he carelessly fathered with her; a perennially unfaithful yet passionate and sexually satisfying husband; a problem drinker, a habitual liar. The calmer waters of Constanze's second marriage seem well-deserved after what she put up with while married to Mozart!
A1F7V34D43GDHY	0	0	Argh, how to describe this weirdly-seasoned stew of a book? The author comes across as an over-intellectualized, neurotic, guiltily homosexual, prodigiously conceited, agonizingly self-conscious, precious academic snob--one of those inadvertent self-parodies that abound among the faculties of Ivy League universities.Rome through his eyes seems to consist entirely of married men who, given their druthers, would really all be gay as daisies. But alas, they've made their choice to marry and all they can do is play frustrating little semi-sexual games with poor Barkan, most of them consisting of elaborate rituals involving food and wine. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the author because he's too neurotic to find himself an openly gay partner and have an affair? But that would be way too simple. Barkan would rather wallow in his self-absorbed and self-created complexities.The most interesting part of this book consists of Barkan's struggles with the subtleties of the Italian language. But even here, the author's monumental conceit keeps getting in the way; he can't resist bragging to the reader over and over again about his mastery of so many languages and his considerable skills in Italian. He's not over-estimating those skills--his translations of some of the really raunchy "pasquinades" of the Renaissance are extremely clever.If the book weren't set in Rome, I'd never have been able to finish it. But, in the moments when Barkan drops his obsession with handsome men, expensive wine, and gourmet food, it was fun to see familiar fragments of the Eternal City through (very!) different eyes.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	A very long but consistently gripping tale set in 19th-century London; sort of a Dickens novel with body fluids. It's the story of an ambitious, intelligent young woman's rise from whorehouse prostitution to a position as governess of her wealthy lover's daughter, and an increasingly important role as his financial/commercial adviser as well. It's particularly interesting as a study of the brutal economics of prostitution: a woman of that era could make a lot more money as a whore than she could doing factory work, and the work was a lot easier and the hours shorter. My favorite exchange takes place between a frightfully repressed would-be curate and a prostitute. The man is trying, awkwardly, to find out why women become prostitutes. He certainly has his suspicions-- a classic case of projection so intense it's practically projectile: "What about... lust?" he asks her. The woman responds with something like: "Oh yes, lust! I definitely have a great lust for food. I lust for a roof over my head and I lust for a few articles of clothing."The ending is odd and some may find it unsatisfying, but throughout the book the author is at some pains to let us know that this is very much a modern narrative and not just updated Dickens.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	The author of "Rome, the Biography of a City," is not Alberto Pisa; it's Christopher Hibbert! I'm sure that the author of this excellent book would NOT appreciate seeing it attributed to someone else.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	This is among the most memorable novels I've ever read--right up there with Sophie's Choice. Just as Styron took on one great evil of the 20th century, the Holocaust, presenting it not in abstract terms but via a memorable character, so Fairbairn takes on the uniquely American evil of that century, racism, through the character David Champlin.The time frame of the novel is the 1930s through the early 1960s, and it I think it was written around 1966. It's "dated" in some ways--college students certainly don't talk today like the ones in this novel; attitudes toward homosexuality have improved markedly, and so have race relations, although in the latter two areas prejudices persist and there's still plenty of room for improvement.I've never read a more profound and sensitive psychological portrait of racism's corrosive effects on both races, or a more damning picture of the utter ugliness and moral squalor of the white southern racist's views and behavior. But the author doesn't confine herself to condemnations of white southerners; she also takes on the less direct but in some ways equally damaging forms of racism in the north, especially among that certain set of educated, well-meaning white liberals. And she doesn't ignore the reverse racism of many blacks--their refusal to see any good whatsoever among whites. She presents a number of vividly drawn white characters who are exceptions to the rule of white racism. Also like Sophie's Choice, you know from the beginning that this book will be about a tragedy, although until the very end the reader doesn't know exactly how that tragedy will happen.I'm amazed that Fairbairn isn't celebrated along with James Baldwin, Richard Wright, etc., as among the greatest black American writers; in my opinion, her writing is much superior to theirs. (I'm assuming that Fairbairn is an African American writer; I know nothing about her beyond this book, which I don't think could have been written by a white person.)
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	HERE is a novel by a truly talented author in full control of her craft! From the hilariously misleading title right to the last page this is a beautifully controlled narrative and darts back and forth in time without ever once allowing the reader to lose track of where in time and space the narration takes place.The clipped dialogue captures to perfection a certain type and class of old-time Englishman, of which Eddie Feathers, aka "Filth," is one. His nickname comes from his having invented an acronym describing people like himself, who didn't succeed in London but who were very successful when they moved East: "Failed In London, Try Hong-kong."Without for a moment becoming maudlin, the author conveys the horrible toll taken on the "Raj orphans," the children (like Filth) of British colonials who were sent "Home" to England and virtually abandoned there to the indifferent care of distant relatives, abusive foster-homes, and the occasional, ultimately unreliable, kindness of friends.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	A beautifully written and very insightful memoir by a woman who grew up in "the bush" in Australia and eventually become the first female president of Smith College. This volume begins in the author's childhood and ends with her decision to depart Australia forever, when she's accepted into the doctoral program in history at Harvard. She's particularly insightful about her difficult relationship with her mother, who both pushes her to achieve and tries ruthlessly to hold her back, as well in her descriptions of her own dawning feminist consciousness.The only glaring fault with this book is that the author comes dangerously close to ignoring the ghastly treatment of Australia's aboriginal population by the white settlers. In her opening chapter, which sketches Australia's modern history, she doesn't even mention the subject. I could understand why she omitted this in the early chapters about her childhood, when she was unaware of this aspect of her country's history, and in a later chapter, she does acknowledge that the white culture of Australia was predicated upon destroying and/or ignoring the native culture. But even there, her indignation is muted, despite the fact that Australian whites' history with the Aborigines makes our treatment of Native Americans and the history of slavery in the United States look almost benign! Hasn't Conway ever read Robert Hughes' history of Australia, "The Fatal Shore?"
A1F7V34D43GDHY	0	0	A mildly interesting but somehow affectless tale of a wife who tires of her familial role and just walks away from it. The weird thing about the story is the almost total lack of drama. None of her three teenage kids seem terribly upset, and neither does her husband. The woman, Delia, starts a new and quite Spartan life not far away; she's soon found, but nobody, least of all her husband, makes any real effort to persuade her to return.What little sex the book contains is so listless as to be almost laughable: Delia's half-hearted semi-affair with a neighbor who is separated from his wife, and then one kiss exchanged with the divorced man whose live-in housekeeper Delia becomes. The idea that this pleasant looking, 40-ish woman could live for months in the same house with a divorced man of about the same age (described by the author as attractive and lacking a girlfriend) and his son, with only one tiny spark of sexual attraction flaring briefly between them, is hard to believe.And then in the end, Delia just sort of wanders back home, casually abandoning the child she'd been caring for and who had become deeply attached to her, and takes up where she left off, as everybody's doormat and not-so-happy housewife. I suppose the moral (if there is one) is that any marriage is better than no marriage. Bleah!
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	0	I'd never heard of this author before I picked up this book at a rack of free books at a train station, but apparently she has quite a following as a writer of procedural mysteries. This one isn't a whodunit, however, but a "whydunit." The entire lengthy novel is a detailed account of the events and circumstances leading up to the murder of a wealthy white English woman by a poor black male.It's a story that should make both liberals and conservatives questions their assumptions. Liberals tend to believe in various forms of determinism with regard to individuals and their behavior: economic, psychological, sociological, genetic. Conservative generally believe in free will: no matter what the circumstances, you're always free to make a decision about what you're going to do. In this story, we see liberals as well-meaning but totally ineffectual in their attempts to help poor blacks in London's worst neighborhoods, because they have absolutely NO idea of what really goes on in the lives of the people they're trying to help. And yes, some of the people really DO make bad choices. On the other hand, conservatives who believe that everybody always has a choice of how to behave will see how so many poor people's choices wither and die under the weight of circumstances beyond their control.We follow the lives of a "black" extended family in which all the members are actually mixed race--the author mentions Japanese and Moroccan along with white in the family's ethnic mixtures. Some family members struggle to maintain what we'd call middle class values: speaking proper English, dressing neatly and in conventional styles, working hard, owning a home, while others behave "badly," doing all the things conservatives accuse poor people of doing: being lazy, dishonest, uninterested in education, eager to make easy money through crime. In this story, however, we really do see the forces that drive people to make those bad decisions.There's an inevitability akin to Greek tragedy about the way circumstances drive Joel, an intelligent, sensitive, determined but essentially naive boy, to the point of committing crimes in his efforts to protect his younger brother, whose condition is never clearly defined, but who seems to suffer from some form of mental retardation and/or an in-born mental illness. That condition makes the younger boy a tempting target for bullies. Joel's efforts to keep the bullies away from his brother lead him into the thickets of gang life where he's in way above his head, a child dealing with experienced criminals.As sympathetic as the author is to Joel and others who struggle to survive while staying on the right side of the law and out of the clutches of the dreaded social service agencies of the state, she doesn't succeed in making the "bad" characters sympathetic. Although they, too, are shown to be the products of their terrible environment, the author makes them almost too convincingly horrible. Learning that the relentless, sadistic chief bully has a musical talent he's turned away from, or that the brutal, murderous head of the local gang was once a promising philosophy student, doesn't make either of them more sympathetic to the reader. And for this reader at least, learning that Joel's terminally obnoxious older sister had experienced a horrifyingly traumatic childhood failed to make her any less obnoxious to me; I was sorry that the author didn't kill her off at some point. In the end, though, the only dead person is the white woman that Joel is framed for killing. All the evil people survive and prosper, while the good people are, although alive, utterly crushed, which probably is pretty much how the world works for people like the ones portrayed in this novel.For me, the only fault I could find was the author's extremely annoying habit of having so many of her characters end every sentence with the word "innit." I assume this is the local dialect for "Isn't it," but "Isn't it?" is a question. Nonetheless, people end just about every sentence with this word. Maybe it's true that the people whom the author portrays really DO talk that way, but for the sake of her readers I wish she's sacrificed that bit of authenticity.No doubt there are readers who think this white American writer was being terribly presumptuous in trying to write dialogue in the voice of poor black people in London, but I see this as an act of great courage and empathy. Elizabeth George has made an enormous effort to put herself in the positions of those characters and I believe she's succeeded.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	0	0	Sheesh! How do books this bad get published, much less wind up with rapturous comments on the covers? The writing is TERRIBLE: wooden, inexpressive, full of cliches and boring, boring BORING! All the steamy sex in the world becomes ludicrous when it's presented to the reader in such uniformly awful writing. I almost never fail to complete a book, even one I don't particularly like, so I struggled through most of this book, but I just couldn't finish it.Somebody who actually knows how to write should take on this potentially interesting subject.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	Chestnut honey (miele di castagno) is my absolute favorite honey, and so far I've not been able to find it in any food store in the States. This brand is truly delicious, but by the time I'd paid for the product and the shipping, it cost me more than twice as much as buying a comparable amount in Italy would cost. But try making a transatlantic flight with a glass jar in your hand luggage! No way today!If anyone knows of an American supplier of this Italian product, I'd sure like to know about it.
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	0	What a memorable and distressing book! Although it first came out in 1987, it still seems terrifyingly topical. The plot outline is very simple, but the content is complex. We read about an American career diplomat and his wife and son; the man is devoted to his work and sincerely feels that he's doing some good in the world. But his son turns into a terrorist who, in the end, remorselessly murders his father. I don't think the mention of this constitutes a "spoiler." From very on in the book it's inevitable that this will happen.The problem with the story is that we never find out what turned the son into a psychotic mass murder not so different from those who roam around today. His absolute hatred of America and Americans is never adequately explained. I lost whatever small amount of sympathy I might have had for him when he sneers at Abraham Lincoln and compares him to Napoleon!Personally, I think people like the son are born with screws loose in their brains, and it's just a matter of circumstance whether they become terrorists-- part of some shadowy "revolutionary" network that lacks any any positive goals, one that only wants to destroy, one that shoots individuals and blows up people and buildings-- or loners like the one who recently shot 20 children in an elementary school.I really HATED the ending, in which the son murders his father and gets away with it. If the story has to end with the father being killed by the son, I would have liked to see the ambassador's security detail belatedly appear on the scene and kill that nihilist monster-son and do the same to his catatonic slave/girlfriend. If there was ever a pair of literary characters who deserve to be dead, it's those two! I'm still angry that they walked out of the novel alive!
A1F7V34D43GDHY	1	1	The story Wolff tells of Italian generosity, kindness and courage during one of the darkest periods of European history has received far too little attention, in particular from an American media obsessed with images of Italians as either cowards or criminals. Published in a slightly larger and darker than normal print, the book would make an attractive gift for elderly people, but is equally fine as a present to young persons. Because Wolff writes in a simple, straightforward style, the book can be an excellent way to introduce older children or grandchildren to an inspiring, little-known chapter in Italian history. The many personal photographs that illustrate the book, which Wolff somehow managed to preserve through all his travels and tragedies, add an intimate and vivid dimension to his narrative.Wolff doesn't focus on Nazi terror or a bitter recitation of personal calamities. Instead, he sprinkles his narrative with moments of humor and sometimes rambling anecdotes, but one point is always crystal-clear: Walter Wolff owes his life to the Italians who hid him, fed him, sheltered him, bent rules on his behalf and employed him, all at the risk of their own lives, while expecting nothing in return, and he is eternally grateful. This book is his way of thanking the Italian nation.Wolff is a fortunate man. In the autobiographical sketch at the beginning of his book he describes a happy childhood in the German city of Frankfurt, where he lived securely within his family and the city's thriving Jewish community. His education included the study of foreign languages and he developed a facility that later made it possible for him to become fluent in Italian in a matter of weeks. A rigorous program of sports ensured that he was physically fit, another factor that helped him survive. A subsequent chapter describes how this seemingly secure world crashed in flames after Hitler came to power in 1933. In 1938, just after the mass destruction of Jewish property during "Kristallnacht," Wolff was arrested and sent to Dachau. But even there his luck held. He endured terrible hardships and humiliations, but this was before the Nazis had perfected their machinery of mass killing. Wolff's strong physique and mental stability enabled him to survive slave labor conditions in the concentration camp that killed many weaker men, and less than a year later--almost miraculously, he claims--he was released.Wolff made unsuccessful efforts to immigrate to the United States with his mother and brother, but they were thwarted by American indifference to their plight and their application was denied on a technicality. The Wolff family then made plans to flee to Shanghai, where many Jews had already found refuge. To get there, however, they needed to board a steamer leaving from Italy. They reached Italy in late August of 1939, only three days before Hitler invaded Poland and World War II officially began. Abandoning their efforts to reach Shanghai, the Wolffs concluded that chances of surviving the war were greater if they stayed in Italy. Their experiences in Italy in the years to follow proved the wisdom of that decision.At first the family found refuge in the Jewish community of Genoa, where Walter realized that in order to earn a living he had to learn Italian--fast. Without textbooks or teachers, he found an ingenious solution. For several weeks he "practically moved into the cinema," paid for one admission and stayed all day, watching the same films over and over, soaking up the rhythms and intonations of the language along with vocabulary, grammar and idiomatic expressions. His crash course paid off and soon he was speaking fluent Italian, without any foreign accent, a skill that would prove vital to his later survival.In June of 1940, shortly after Mussolini proclaimed his fateful alliance with Hitler, round-ups of Jews and foreigners in Italy began. But the three separate camps to which the Wolff family members found themselves transported had nothing in common with the slave labor and death camps of the Nazis. The Italian camp authorities treated the internees with consideration, allowed them to wear civilian clothes and permitted Jewish religious observances. The authorities even made efforts to reunite divided families and Walter soon joined his mother and brother at the Ferramonte camp in Calabria. Not long afterward the authorities announced that families would be allowed to leave Ferramonte and live in designated "internment towns." Having heard that the northern Italian town of Casale Monferrato had a Jewish community, the Wolff family chose to move there. Walter found a job teaching English to Italian military units--English was one of the languages he'd studied at school in Germany--and another post at a scientific institute translating documents from French and English into Italian, as well as assisting the rabbi at the local synagogue. At no point did he or his family encounter discrimination or anti-Semitism.Happily involved in their lives in Casale Monferrato, the Wolffs failed to notice the ominous results of the developments taking place around them, beginning in 1943. Mussolini's regime fell and Italy signed a treaty with the Allies. But the government of General Pietro Badoglio reckoned without the vindictive fury of the Germans, who invaded Italy, determined to make the Italians pay for their "treason" and equally determined to impose on Italy the savage persecution of Jews that Italians had so far refused to carry out. One evening a local policeman named Giovanni appeared at the door of the Wolffs' apartment with an extraordinary message. He warned them that he had orders to arrest them the next morning at 8 am and turn them over to the Germans. Then he moved on to alert the town's other Jewish residents. Instead of arranging his book in strict chronological order, Wolff quickly grips the reader's attention by beginning his narrative with this terrifying and yet inspiring moment, when an Italian policeman risked his own life to save theirs.From the moment the Wolff family fled Casale Monferrato they depended for their very survival on the help they received from native Italians. Peasants hid them in attics, barns and shacks, smuggled food and blankets to them, then, as the Germans approached, passed them on to other peasants who did the same. Occasionally they hid in churches, where local priests truly earned the title of pastor as they ministered to sick, ragged, terrified people who were being hunted down like animals. At any point, if the Germans had learnt of the help that individual Italians had provided to these Jewish fugitives, they would have shot them on the spot.At a point when Wolff was uncertain he and his family could endure life on the run for much longer, he pulled off an amazing ruse, again with the help of an Italian priest. Noticing a sign which said Mussolini had issued a decree that deserters from the Italian army who turned themselves in would be granted amnesty and given ration cards, Wolff decided to transform himself into an Italian soldier! Following his "gut instinct" to trust members of the Catholic clergy, he found a priest who steered him to an official in a small Italian town who issued him a set of false identity papers. Walter Wolff emerged as an Italian war veteran named Valter Monti. Here, too, if any of the people he approached had been collaborators or just anti-Semitic, Wolff would never have lived to tell his story.Now passing as a native Italian, Wolff moved with his family to Milan, where he obtained a position as a translator for a petroleum company, a firm that still had dealings with Germany. Wolff asks us to imagine the situation--there he was, a German Jew masquerading as a former Italian soldier, tallying gasoline shipments to the German army! He had to make sure he put on a heavy Italian accent when conversing with Germans in his native language. Even his landlady thought Wolff was Italian and sometimes tried to do a bit of match-making for her attractive, single tenant. Wolff later learned by chance that the landlady, an elderly widow, was hiding five refugees in her basement: two Jews, two English pilots who had been shot down, and an American soldier who had escaped from a prisoner of war camp--another unsung Italian hero who risked her life to save others.Wolff witnessed the victorious Allied entry into Milan on April 25, 1945 and with the Nazi threat gone, was able to reclaim his true identity. At a victory party Walter met a young Jewish woman named Vittoria Fubini from--of all places--Casale Monferrato, the town where the Wolff family had lived during their internment. They were married in a civil ceremony before Wolff emigrated to America and she joined him in New York a few months later. After renewing their marital vows in a Jewish ceremony the young couple, like so many other immigrants, began their new life in America. In 1972 a trip back to the European cities of their childhood and then to Israel convinced Wolff to begin telling his story by speaking at schools and synagogues. As his list of speaking engagements increased over the years, Wolff realized how little anyone in America knew about Italian heroism during the Holocaust and therefore resolved to write this book.After completing Wolff's book I was struck by the absence of any mention of the role played by the institutional Catholic Church, and Pope Pius XII, in the saving of Jews in Italy. Those who insist on the vital role played by Pius in saving Jews do a disservice to the Italian people by implying that they helped Jews only because the pope encouraged or ordered them to do so. Instead, Wolff observed that Italians needed no prompting from the papacy. Italians both clerical and secular saved Jews because they instinctively understood their duty to their fellow human beings. The portrait Wolff provides of Italian cleverness, courage and simple human decency makes his book a worthy addition to any library.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	I have these baskets on the shelf of my changing table. One holds diapers and the other holds miscellaneous "stuff" like lotions, nail clippers, small toys, medicines etc. They are a great size and are very sturdy.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	I really do wonder how I lived with out this with my first child. This hamper is not only cute as its buttons but is so easy to use. Fill 'er up and walk off with the liner! I keep the liner on top of the dryer until the load is done, put everything back in the liner to carry back to the nursery. No extra step involving a bulky laundry basket. I would recommend this to anyone. Not that it matters, but mine is green:)
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	How often has this happened, You are stuck in the car with your young kids listening to "Jesus Loves Me", "The Wheels on the Bus" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" over and over again. Or even worse, one of those "Kids Beat" CDs where they have kids singing top 40 songs, inappropriate lyrics and all. If its not on the car stereo, the kids are in the backseat singing!The classics are wonderful and have their place but with Laurie Burkner you have good quality music for kids that are not only tolerable to adults ears but are enjoyable and fun to listen to.The musicianship is excellent and fun and the themes are age appropriate from infants on up.I am so THANKFUL to Noggin TV for introducing my 11 month old to Laurie Burkner and Dan Zanes to add NEW fun songs into the collection that everyone in the car enjoys and sings along to.This isn't justs kids music, its FAMILY Music.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	I bought the first set of these when my daughter was 6 months old. At that stage she wasnt into rolling the balls as much as clutching them, shaking them like mad and putting them into her mouth. Now that they are a favorite they are all over my house. She loves to carry them with her, they are the perfect size for a toddlers chubby hands, she enjoys looking at the objects inside and manipulating them. Now she loves to push them and chase them across the floor so I think these are educational and very multifunctional.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	When my daughter opened this on her 1st birthday my immediate thought was - Oh, another keyboard (She got 4 this year). This is one cute toy. It has so many functions that I am sure she will use more and more of as she gets older. It does have a keyboard but also plays individual songs, is a ball drop and teaches cause and effect. Its bright colored and lights up and isnt tooo loud. One HUGE point with me is, it comes with 4 balls. AND its built to STORE the balls when not in use. She has a FisherPrice ball drop toy that the balls are all over our house because there is nowhere to store them.Now granted, my daughter hasnt had this very long so we have not had time to get sick of the main song but so far she really loves it and is exploring all of the different things it does. I believe this toy has staying power. I just wish it was a little sturdier. She tries to pull up on it to put the balls in the top and it topples right over.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	I bought this airmattress at a Walmart on our way out of town to go camping. I bought the cheapest mattress they had because we just expect air mattresses to deflate and become useless after a few times out.I was tremendously impressed with this one. The airpump came with it with all of its attachments actually attached to the unit. You cannot loose the attachments unless you cut them off of it. It was very easy to operate and switch nozzles.It comes with a carrying bag so you dont have to try and fold it up and cram it back into the cardboard box! It easily went back into its bag and cut down on the packing space.The mattress itself had its caps attached so they cant go missing either. The flocked edges are soft and comfortable, you dont get that clammy feel you get from regular plastic mattresses.We slept for 2 nights on this mattress and were completely comfortable. It did not need reinflating after the first night. The second night, the weather got down to 40 degrees and even then we did not loose any noticable volume in the mattress.I cannot recommend this one highly enough. I would also feel comfortable using this for guests in my home. If I could give 10 stars I would.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	I wont bore you by going into specs and the like, you can read that online. What I will tell you is that I am not a very techy minded person and I love my new Ipod. Mine is a black 30 GB. It is amazingly easy to use, I wanted it primarily for MP3 usage. Now that I have had it for a week I store photos, MP3s, Episodes of Lost and Podcasts. I love that I can watch these little video podcasts, its like having an electronic magazine or a good radio show at my finger tips. I cannot believe how easy this thing is to use. I did have to disable my firewall at first to get the Itunes music store to work, you may have to do this.Anyway, I enjoy how versitile this thing is, how easy it is to use and its just fun. I spend alot of time sitting in a carpool line listening to talk radio. Now I can carry my Ipod, catch up on my TV shows, listen to a podcast I actually care about or just listen to my favorite tunes.I also want to add that there is an album I have been wanting for years, its been out of print and Amazon and the like could not get it for me. I found it on Itunes and was able to with one click download the whole album for less than it would have cost me to buy.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	My husband came home with this this week for our 16 month old. My first reaction was, She is no where near old enough for this. Boy was I wrong. My daughter love this DVD. Which is saying alot because she has no patience or interest in TV.She gets up and dances, she turns in circles and claps her hands. She has several princess dolls already and points the the princess she has.Where I agree with earlier reviewers that the modern mixes and dance videos are a bit . . contrived, the music is bad, the dancers are terrible, my daughter really enjoyed them. She likes to watch the bigger kids dance around and tries to dance with them, she turns when they turn, she bends down when they do. So I just kept in mind that I was not the target demographic of this DVD.I do wish they had stuck with Jimminy Cricket though throughout. We have an older Sing Along Songs on VHS and its structure and flow is a bit better. That is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5.The menu is also very user friendly, though I do not understand the Fast play. We selected that and then had to sit through 20 minutes of preview and commercials . . not fast at all.But still, all in all it was a very cute DVD and fun for my daughter.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	My daughter got this bed for her 2nd birthday. It WAS a challenge to put together, and very daunting when removed from the box. Once it was put together though, it is breathtaking. We constantly get compliments on it as it is very unique. The color is not what one would call a True pink. Its a dusty color, closer to a mauve. But it is not that far off from what is in the pictures. My daughter has an upholstered throne and ottoman from Target that is the exact same color.My only complaint is that there is nothing attaching the crowns to the top of the posters. They are plastic and you force them down on the top of the posters. I wish they had a screw or something to secure them. The first few weeks of sleeping in the bed resulted in daily searches around her room for the crowns. On the other hand, the hollow in the top of them is the perfect place to put our paci first thing in the morning for safe keeping.We have had no trouble with the crib mattress not fitting. Ours fits snuggly. With our Disney Princess sheet set, we have a room fit for our little princess. We could not be happier, when she out grows it (which will not be for several years), we will put it up for her children.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	My 2 year old daughter is always trying to play with her 9 year old brother's cars. These are perfect for her because they are big enough to fit in her hands and feature her favorite Princesses, Ariel, Aurora and Cinderealla. If you push them forward a few times before letting them go they will coast along on their own power or you can put them up on their back two wheels for wheelie power. My father got them to spin but I could not figure out how he did it!! They are cute and lightweight but not flimsey at all in design. They are about the size of one of her shoes so they are bigger than your average matchbox car.Very very cute toys!
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	This is basicly a book of manners for a prereading crowd.My husband bought this book for our 2 year old as a treat. It has very simple language, one sentence per page. It is things like A Princess is caring.Our daughter loves it because she loves to repeat phrases and they are simple enough for her to repeat and feel like she is reading.I feel that children are never to young to learn to read and love reading so this little book was a good fit for us.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	This is a neat toy. My daughter got it for Christmas when she was 1. What a waste that was. This is advertised for 9-18 months and boy is that wrong.Even with my help my daughter got frustrated and hated it. She banged on it and could get no result from it. It needs finer motor skills than she had. And like other reviewers have said, the on off button right there just temps them to turn it on and off.That being said, My daughter rediscovered it this week. She will be 2 next week. Suddenly its a favorite. She quickly figured out how to mash the different areas to get the desired effects. She sings along and caught on to push the "GO" at the top of each page.So far she has only really played with the starter book, she has enjoyed it so much I havent seen a need to pull out the Pooh book she also has. This toy can grow with your child as it has 3 settings with each book.Overall its a very versitile toy with alot of potential. Its pluses outweigh its minuses as long as your child is over the age of 2. Ofcourse it always helps to know your childs tolerances and likes. My 9 year old would have hated this toy. He hated anything that talked or sang, he would have rather had a plain old book. The biggest minuses are in its design: the volume and on/off buttons right there on the front, the amount of pressure needed to get it to do anything, the flimsiness of the pages.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	My son loves dinosaurs but had outgrown alot of the kids books out there. This is a great book for older kids and adults will like it too.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	My daughter really doesnt care for blocks. She got this set for Christmas when she was 1 and is now 2. The blocks do nothing for her, but what she DOES like is to pile them all in the carriage and pull them around behind her. The carriage has played host to all of her baby dolls, all of her beanie babies and anything else that is small enough to climb in and go for a ride.Even though the blocks are not played with I give this toy 5 stars, good colors, good durability and the carriage makes a great miniwagon.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	1	This is a darling set. It is very pretty and all the classic durability you would expect from FiestaWare. But as the previous review said, Its misnamed at "Tea for Two". The teapot holds two cups but only comes with one cup. If you want to serve tea to a friend, you will have mismatched cups.That being said, I used my teapot this morning to heat up 2 cups of water. One cup went into the teacup for hot cider for me, the other I poured into a Nascar mug for my 9 year old to have hot chocolate.In short, this is a great set as long as you understand you are only getting 1 teacup.
A1F8FJUJ2TEOJP	1	0	This is a lovely costume, the skirt is full and flounces like a princess dress should. However, before we were even done with the first time playing in it, the hem fell right out. Just unraveled and left a long trail of string I kept having to cut off. Because its flimsy fabric, it just keeps unraveling unless you hem it. If you get this and are not a seamstress, I suggest going to your local fabric store and buying some "Fray Check" and applying it to the hem of this dress. It will save you so much trouble.I am glad we did not try to wear this OUT anywhere.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	0	0	A very unimpressive book. The author simply ignores 1) historical examples which don't support his theory; 2) differences between the various competing design philosophies in the class of ships generally referred to as &quot;dreadnoughts&quot;; 3) increasing accuracy of fire control, and its effect of increasing effective range; 4) rapid pace of technological chnage during the pre-WW1 timeperiod, and its effect on ship design assumptions; etc., etc.In general, this book is better researched than your average undergraduate essay, but the analysis is comparable. It's only saving grace is the sociological examination of the mindset of American naval officers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and that is tempered by the complete lack of comparison with the greater contemporary society.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	0	0	Very weak book, with bad writing, boring plot, little action. Clancy needs to hire better ghostwriters.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	1	1	This is an exceptionally good book, perhaps THE reference book on U.S. submarines in the post-War era. Very detailed and accurate, it covers not only final designs, but how each design evolved over time -- including designs that never made it off the drawing board. If you're in to submarines, you MUST own this book.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	1	1	The first book in Lee and Miller's (although the cover says &quot;Miller &amp; Lee&quot;) Liaden series. Witty, intelligent, and fun -- the only problems with this book and the others in the series is that you can't &quot;read a few pages before going to sleep,&quot; because next thing you know you've read 200 pages and the dawn is beginning to peak through the curtains.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	1	0	Third book in Miller and Lee's Liaden series (although, chronologically, it comes before the other two).Why buy two? Because one of two things will happen: either you will wear it out from constant re-reading, or you will loan it to someone who will absolutely REFUSE to return it to you.Better yet, both might happen -- better buy three.
A1F8GOAL5JBHXS	1	1	Second of Miller and Lee's Liaden series. So good, it's one of a handful of books that I automatically buy in used bookstores and then give away to people. Never had anyone give it back when they were done, either.
A1F8UHE4CIZRQ1	1	0	This router is fast but the firmware is both lacking and still has a dns relay bug. Dns relay is enabled by default. This means that the router gives out itself as the dns server in dhcp. This is common however d-link's dns relaying has a flaw. Dns lookups are cached and fill up the allocated dns memory. Once this memory is exhausted the router hangs on subsequent dns lookups for about ten minutes until the memory is cleared and the caching starts over. I have the latest firmware 2.0.0. I experience this issue about once or twice a day. Turning off dns relay fixes the problem but the router should not be broken by default and this defeats the benefit of dns relay which is faster dns lookups.One thread detailing the issue: [....]
A1F8UHE4CIZRQ1	0	1	This book advocates child abuse of both a mental and physical nature. Is your child having trouble potty training? Punish him with cold baths. Crying? Beat the kid.This book is amazingly horrible to your child's development and well-being.
A1F8UHE4CIZRQ1	0	0	This product contains the food industry's replacement for trans fat: interesterified oil. You can look up many scientific studies and peer reviewed data in journals at has found these engineered oils are more harmful than trans fat was. Most products hide these but luckily it is clearly listed on the ingredients here so we know it is in there. Interesterified oil is created by modifying unsatured fat to gain a satires fat carbon bond on the second carbon chain. This causes the fat to be by shelf stable but unfortunately also seems to cause it to lead to heart disease and other health problems. Do some research and avoid this if you care about health. This product also contains TBHQ which vs a questionable preservative. Research is early but it did show tumors and DNA damage in lab experiments on rats. Human studies are lacking so far.The other Santa Fe bean products do not contain these potentially health destroying components. I am not sure why they decided to turn otherwise healthy food into such a bad one. They are indeed tasty but I want to live longer to continue to eat tasty things.
A1F9O40TLLUEN5	1	1	Most of the hardcore ashcroft fans seem to bash this record, maybe it's because this one is more accesible than the human conditions album, arguably, the previous one&#65533;s got a more complex intention and concept, and less hooks than keys to the world.Nevertheless this album is not to intended to be a step forward in that direction. I really enjoyed keys to the world, top notch production, hooks, and good melodies. For me Aschcroft is still congruent with himself, and citing from the interview in the dvd, "the best is yet to come".
A1F9O40TLLUEN5	1	1	the definitive incubus album that translates in a kind of friendly and slightly more focused "Mr. Bunglesque" album
A1F9O40TLLUEN5	0	0	If were 15, I'd probably like this album, then again, what's really frustrating is that, a band like at the drive-in never got the praise this band has. But whatever, just listen to the lyrics, plain bad... even with the catchy riffs, and the artificial pasting of them in jesus of suburbia don't save this album.Then again taking it into context, only teenagers listen to this poor musical offer, but given the praise in the music media and pressing this gets only one star.
A1F9OXWP840WAH	1	1	The illustrations in this story are what make it so memorable. The simple line pictures help to make the text of the story tangible. Even after thirty years, I instantly recognized the cover of this book as one of my favorites as a child.Ms. Green passes on a playful "immigrant's" story that I hope your children will cherish as much as I did.This is out-of-print, but try to pick one up used via Amazon!
A1F9OXWP840WAH	1	0	The first book in the Baritmaeus Trilogy was good, so I picked up this second book and expected to like the book as I had the first one. Instead, I heartily enjoyed it.I've started collecting books for my children and will turn around and sell any that are poorly written or are just plain dull. This series is a keeper!I tend to skim through sections of books that are wallowing in tedious, dry, and boring detail, but this book keeps your attention with well-written detail that doesn't skimp on the character development. The plot twists are fresh, the storyline is fun, and this is an overall wonderful book. I'm looking forward to the final book in the trilogy--Stroud's books so far have been a treat.Believe the high ratings for this book and treat yourself to some good fun and good reading.
A1F9OXWP840WAH	1	1	Maggots and Dante and sleuthing, oh my!It took a while to get my teeth into the story. For those looking for a gripping mystery from page one on, this won't immediately satisfy. The story of the period, place, and characters (mid-1800s, Boston, and a cast of real literary and notable figures of the time) takes a little while to solidify enough before the reader can turn to the mystery and action itself. Give yourself over to committing to at least thirty pages before you decide whether to continue with this book.Once the story's pieces are in place, however, it's a real treat to find oneself privy to the thoughts and actions of the Dante Club's illustrious members as they discover the key behind the 'Lucifer' running rampant in their city. The author truly knows his Dante material--I had my version of "The Divine Comedy" sitting next to me for reference to help put the real-life Dante's Hell into perspective. It was surprising to find such a young author writing such mature material. Mature in the sense that you envision a wizened professor of Dante creating a book such as this, not a young man who completed his first draft of this story while in law school.The members of the Dante Club--Fields, Holmes, Lowell, and Longfellow--keep you hanging on to their coattails as they dash about Boston searching for the author of the brutal slayings mirrored after Dante's hellish punishments. While keeping one eye on suspects, they also have to keep the notoriously corrupt Boston detectives from sniffing out the inspiration for the murders. The trail would lead back to one of them! Only the Dante Club members themselves have enough knowledge of Dante's work to interpret the method of punishments meted out, so who is behind the murders?If you're a fan of intelligent historical fiction, this one should be on your 'must have' list.
A1F9OXWP840WAH	1	1	Almost perfect! The book rolls merrily along from the beginning, with a cast of sympathetic characters, a nice spin on faeries, and tangible environments.This was an interesting story that held me in its enchanting grip...until I ran smack into the ending.As a previous review has mentioned, there is an air of contrivance in the story's resolution. I would add that it's just plain disappointing for a reader. It felt too easy, as if the author grew tired of the writing and just wanted to wrap things up quickly while leaving room for a possible sequel. Or, the author had the entire thing written and lopped it into three parts at convenient intervals--without spending much time working out how to make the break seamless and as embellished like the bulk of the story.Everything was wonderful until the last few chapters. Then, all the efforts of the characters turn out to be unnecessary, personalities with great potential turn out to be given flat conclusions, and the main character takes a confusing jaunt into another time. It's like an artist signing a wonderful painting with a puce-colored crayon--it just detracts from the whole effect and is confusing to boot. It was really too bad, because there were numerous possibilities for an ending that was as excellent as the rest of the story.Something to be aware as well are a couple of gruesome/violent sections in the story. They were short and the author didn't dwell on them, but it surprised me to find them in a story like this. But then again, some children like scary/gory stories nowadays. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned.All of that said, perhaps this was just a tantalizing lead to a sequel. Maybe the author will redeem his characters by allowing them fruition in another story. I sincerely hope so.I recommend the book, but with some reservations as noted above. Judge for yourself.-------*Addendum* A later reviewer criticized me for not doing a "little research" to determine that this was the first in a trilogy. I would respond by suggesting that I shouldn't have to do any research on a book prior to reading it. A good book should stand on its own, without any explanation or apologies.Besides, I still enjoyed the book...I gave it four out of five stars because it was a good book. I just didn't think the ending the author chose to use as a marker for the trilogy was up to par.My original review still stands--the ending is rushed and disappointing, while everything prior to that is excellent. A trilogy book can be suggestive of a sequel, but shouldn't leave you hanging out on a creaking limb at the end. All the characters had their personalities lopped off to conclude things quickly--it felt rushed and was disappointing after such good initial writing. For a good trilogy marker, check out the "His Dark Materials" trilogy by Pullman. The pacing is excellent and
