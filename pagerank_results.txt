Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch! Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a "Kindle killer" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term "baby" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an "oleophobic" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13" or 15" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring "folders" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or "Kindle killer" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app "iBooks" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite "iWork" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term "multi-touch". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called "Camera A" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the "Camera B" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of "apps for that". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)

Great litte netbook, impressive touchscreen, great bettery As soon as Steve Jobs specified what the iPad would be, I was disappointed, and realized that I needed something else to be my touch-screen computer of choice.  I looked first at the Archos 9 PC tablet, but I realized that the touch screen was resistive, would not support multi-touch, and did not have a real keyboard, which was a large downside for schoolwork.  After looking at CES, I found the Lenovo s10-3tWhen I first put this netbook together, I was surprised by the size of the battery- it wasn't as large as people who reviewed it told me it was, but it definitely jetted out of the computer.  Many argue that the keyboard is cheap, but I actually like the way it feels.  Unlike most netbooks, It doesn't feel super-duper small in your hands.  The track pad is ridiculously small compared to most other netbooks in its class.  The two buttons are integrated into the touchpad, but it does not work like the Macbooks, where you can click anywhere on the track pad.  When I plugged it in, the light on the lid of the netbook is not helpful.  It does not indicate when the battery is full, and there is no way to check the level of charge without actively turning on the computer.  IT was also difficult for me to disconnect the charger from the port on the computer.  The netbook has two USB ports, a VGA port, which is useful for connecting to projectors, and an Ethernet port for wired access.Turning on the computer, there were loads of bloatware, as Lenovo does not even let your load Windows without launching all of their software programs.The touchscreen-The multitouch capacitive screen works well.  Turning the screen, rotating the hinge was pretty easy.  However when moving around the laptop with the screen open (in laptop mode) the screen would fall flat backward.  The hinge moved too easily.  This began to concern me.  I have not taken action to call Lenovo about this issue yet.  Most of its capabilities are only available after upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium.  I found a copy of the Anytime Upgrade to Home Premium on EBay for 40 dollars, but otherwise the full cost of the product is 79.99.  The upgrade process takes 10 minutes, and does not affect your files.  Once the upgrade was installed, I was able to pinch, zoom, swipe, rotate and highlight almost any website or window. The raised bezel makes it difficult, however, to click in the corners.  I had some trouble clicking the start button; every time I tried it would load something different from my taskbar.  I fixed the issue by increasing the size of the taskbar, and moving the start button a little higher on the screen.  However this limited my viewing space.  In tablet mode, portrait was uncomfortable, there isn't much room to hold the tablet in this orientation, and although some argue the battery makes a nice handle, it gets in the way. I imagined I could hold the tablet in portrait mode to read eBooks, but the screen is almost too widescreen and the reading space I was left with were extremely narrow.  When holding the tablet in landscape mode, Lenovo did a great job making it easy to hold, to prevent the accidental touch of the power button, they created a hold switch.  This was nice for watching Hulu, or any video.  I found myself loving Aero Snap- I would unmaximize my windows and center them so I could click the X button, closing programs.  The Ribbon UI of the MS Office Suite worked great with the touchscreen, but some programs did not work as well.Anyone who purchases this computer must remember that Windows 7 is a full desktop operating system with features that allow touch, and is not a trapped, compressed Apple-support-only operating system where all of the buttons and everything has been customized to the hardware.As a netbook-The netbook isn't slow.  It isn't super-fast either, it's a netbook.  The processor is pretty fast for an Atom, 1.66 GHz.  When I opened Windows task manager with all of my usual programs open, I found that I was using 82% of my memory.  I purchased 2GB of RAM on EBay for 30 dollars, and I found a significant difference in speed.  Converting to tablet mode became much faster.  Loading, minimizing, and all touchscreen functions became much more responsive.I enabled the Quick Start in the BIOS settings, and enjoyed that functionality, it was speedy, but I kept the netbook on for most of the time, and never used it extensively.OVERVIEWPROS- Great, speedy netbook (with add-on), Quick start Feature, long lasting battery (14 hours, I was able to achieve) Responsive multitouch touchscreen, Wireless N, full size keyboard.CONS- hinge moves too easily, tiny touchscreen, touchscreen loves fingerprints,  horrible speakers ( tinny sound)  have to pay extra for Windows Upgrade.

much too slow I wanted to like this thing. I added more memory in hopes that it might speed up, I killed all the unnecessary running apps, I did everything short of trashing it. This machine is so slow you can actually cook dinner while waiting for a page to load. And they are still selling this hunk of junk for good money. The trade in is $75.00 and thats generous for something so useless.

Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch! Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a "Kindle killer" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term "baby" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an "oleophobic" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13" or 15" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring "folders" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or "Kindle killer" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app "iBooks" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite "iWork" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term "multi-touch". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called "Camera A" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the "Camera B" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets. Feel free to breeze on through!Size and weight:Height:  9.56 inches (242.8 mm)Width:  7.47 inches (189.7 mm)Depth:  0.5 inch (13.4 mm)Weight:  1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) Wi-Fi model;  1.6 pounds (0.73 kg) Wi-Fi + 3G modelIn the box:  * iPad  * Dock Connector to USB Cable  * 10W USB Power Adapter  * DocumentationDisplay:  * 9.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen Multi-Touch display with IPS technology  * 1024-by-768-pixel resolution at 132 pixels per inch (ppi)  * Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating  * Support for display of multiple languages and characters simultaneouslyWireless and cellular:Wi-Fi model:  * Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n)  * Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR technologyWi-Fi + 3G model:  * UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz)  * GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)  * Data only  * Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n)  * Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR technologyLocation:  * Wi-Fi  * Digital compass  * Assisted GPS (Wi-Fi + 3G model)  * Cellular (Wi-Fi + 3G model)Capacity:  * 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB flash driveProcessor:  * 1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high-performance, low-power system-on-a-chipSensors:  * Accelerometer  * Ambient light sensor  * MagnetometerAudio playback:  * Frequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz  * Audio formats supported: HE-AAC (V1), AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV  * User-configurable maximum volume limitTV and video:  * Support for 1024 by 768 pixels with Dock Connector to VGA Adapter; 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable  * H.264 video up to 720p, 30 frames per second, Main Profile level 3.1 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbps, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in ulaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file formatMail attachment support:  * Viewable document types: .jpg, .tiff, .gif (images); .doc and .docx (Microsoft Word); .htm and .html (web pages); .key (Keynote); .numbers (Numbers); .pages (Pages); .pdf (Preview and Adobe Acrobat); .ppt and .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint); .txt (text); .rtf (rich text format); .vcf (contact information); .xls and .xlsx (Microsoft Excel)Languages:  * English, French, German, Japanese, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, RussianKeyboards:  * English (U.S., UK), French (France, Canada), German, Japanese (QWERTY), Dutch, Flemish, Spanish, Italian, Simplified Chinese (Handwriting and Pinyin), RussianDictionaries:  * English (U.S., UK), French, French (Canadian, Swiss), German, Japanese, Dutch, Flemish, Spanish, Italian, Simplified Chinese (Handwriting and Pinyin), RussianAccessibility:  * Support for playback of closed-captioned content  * VoiceOver screen reader  * Full-screen zoom magnification  * White on black display  * Mono audioBattery and power:  * Built-in 25-watt-hour rechargeable lithium-polymer battery  * Up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching video, or listening to music  * Up to 9 hours of surfing the web using 3G data network  * Charging via power adapter or USB to computer systemInput and output:  * Dock connector port  * 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack  * Built-in speaker  * Microphone  * Micro-SIM card tray (Wi-Fi + 3G model only)External buttons and controls:  * On/Off, Sleep/wake  * Mute  * Volume up/down  * HomeMac system requirements:  * Mac or Windows PC with USB 2.0 port  * Mac OS X v10.5.8 or later or Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP Home or Professional with Service Pack 3 or later  * iTunes 9.1 or later (free download)  * iTunes Store account  * Internet access===== Praise =====* iPad continues Apple's trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around* Wireless-n support, means faster and farther-reaching WiFi connections (if your router supports 802.11n)* Battery life: I was acheiving about 8 hours of battery life with constant Netflix streaming over that span of time===== Dissappointments =====* Would have preferred a higher resolution such as 1280x960* Less wasted space, including thinner black margins and more columns of apps on the home screen* Weight could have been closer to a typical magazine (12 ounces)* Wish it were a smaller 8" version with a 163ppi resolution, like iPhone* Still no multi-tasking (though this will be added in the fall iPhone OS 4.0 release)* Crippled Bluetooth stack, lacks support for BT file transfer and DUN profiles* No memory card slot (or maybe this was a ploy to get users to buy the camera kit)* No perceived ability to print. There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of "apps for that". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)

 Length:: 9:40 MinsHopefully my video shows you most of everything you needed to know.If not, please feel free and ask. I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.

The first affordable tablet computer worth buying! Here's an update to my original review.  I bought the iPad on April 3rd (first day it was available).  Best gadget purchase I've ever made.  The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.Here's what I really like about the iPad: 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.  With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes  about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a "standby off" which uses virtually no power and  allows "instant on" capability.  2. Superb web browsing experience.  The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom  in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text  perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.  True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal "hardship" as the iPad has  other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen  Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7" size seems  just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on  a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but  what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided  you are not in direct sunlight.  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.  The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course  it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.  In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several "streaming radio" apps  available that allow you to use your iPad as an "internet radio".  6. Huge library of new and existing applications.  There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a  decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,  there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.  My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather  sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many  free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.  Another great built-in app is "Maps". "Maps" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability  to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can  often compute your approximate location.  7. Great battery life!  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll  get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.  With the lastest software update from Apple, battery  life seems even better.  Even after several months of regular use, I'm getting 10 hours or more of use  per charge.There are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.  My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, "Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?".  Indeed, now  that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting  conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the  iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find  on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.  2. Awkward to hold without a case.  When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,  the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the  experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy  to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad  when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit  without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad  anywhere without it.  3. Not a stellar "WiFi performer".  I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the  iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect  at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to  a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect  even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not  very sensitive) WiFI capability.  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.  Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the  same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering  alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.  5. Kind of a heavy unit.  1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one  to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has  bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass  and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.I've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.I've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over.

Un producto que hay que tener para disfrutar He sido usuario de un iphone 3G y actualmente dispongo de un iphone 4. Lo uso como equipo de comuniacion total, dispongo de aplicaciones para la universidad y mis usos de multimedia, dispongo de servicio de mensajeria instantanea don uso las aplicaciones de whatsapp y Bejivee, con lo cual me comunico con un sin fin de plataformas, adicionalmente disfruto de la calidad de musica que este equipo dispone, por todo esto pense en la compra de un Ipad.Primero debemos de visualizar ?para que necesito una tableta de 10"?, basicamente se respondio mi pregunta cuando la tienes en las manos..R: "para navegar en internet basicamente". Despues de trastearla y colocarle varias aplicaciones, empiesas a familiarizarte con el equipo, la comodidad de llegar a casa conectarte a la red con solo prenderla y tocar un boton, colocando la direccion que se desea ver, ademas de leer los correos, ver videos de youtube y despues de disfrutar de horas de juegos en alta definicion como angribirds o por ejemplo lo uso para colocar musica en las fiestas con Djay, lo cual es de caracter profesional y facil de operar.Es un equipo de alta calidad, con un futuro simplemente limitado por los continuos desarrollos tecnologicos, pero Mi Ipad 1 de 16 gigas wifi, tiene todo el potencial que actualmente necesito.Si consideras comprarla para sacarla a la calle, te recomiendo que seas precavido, llama mucho la atencion.Yo utilizo una base para carro de marca RAM, pongo videos y tengo una pantalla HD de 10" en el carro y con multiples usos, un computador plano en el automovil, incluso con coneccion con internet mediante un iphone.La gran ventaja de su uso dependera del tipo de aplicacion que se necesite, pero realmente MAC ha dado en el clavo, con un equipo de multiples funciones. No limita el no tener puertos USB, realmente en la practico no se necesitan, todo lo transfiero por WEB, incluso mis trabajos de la universidad y presentaciones son posible con un Ipad, y cion excelentes resultados.Es un equipo que hay que probar, casi siempre al final desearas tener uno, despues de tenerlo querras sacarle todo el provecho y desearas otra con mas potencial.

Good price, but you get what you pay for.... I was really excited about getting the Archos 7.  I did some research on Archos' website, and read some reviews here, and decided to purchase it.  It came quick from Amazon as always.  I opened the box up, turned it on, and was really impressed with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing to impress.Where to start:The Archos 7, has a 7 inch screen, which displays a great picture, but 7 inches is a little smaller than you might think it is, especially if your doing a lot of internet surfing.  The touch screen, which unfortunately is resistive, is a HUGE disappointment.  I understand that it keeps the cost down, but with everything moving to capacitive, it's really a let down.  You have to push the screen really hard to make a selection, and even then its hard to make a pin-point selection, i.e. a link on website.  It's very hard to scroll via a finger swipe, and I can't tell you how many times I clicked something I did not mean to click.  I knew when I ordered the Archos that it had the resistive touch screen, and I thought it wouldn't make much of a difference, but it makes a huge difference!  I think it has a 600mhz processor, which does ok, but once you start multi-tasking it gets bogged down rather quickly.  The virtual keyboard is OK, but again, with the resistive touchscreen, it is very difficult and SLOW to type something.  Also lacking on the Archos is the Android operating system it runs on.  Archos ships these units with Android 1.5, which is becoming a relic with 2.1 already out, and 2.2 around the corner.  I havn't heard anything about an update coming for the Archos, but it would be a lot better if they upgraded to the newer firmware.  Also lacking, is access to the android apps store.  Instead this unit ships with Archos' version of an app store called AppsLib.  It has a fraction of the apps that the android store has.  There is also no Youtube, app, and Flash is not supported in the 1.5 version of Android, so you cannot watch Youtube, or any other flash videos for that matter.That being said, the resolution on the Archos 7 screen is pretty stellar, videos and websites look great, as do mobile books and pictures.  The battery life is pretty good as well(and could only stand to get better with an operating system update), lasting about 7hrs with light use.  It also sports a kickstand, and mini sd card slot, along with a usp port(all be it mini usb), which even the Ipad doesn't have.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the good does not outway the bad in this case.To put it simply, if you want something you can surf basic webpage's with, read mobile books, and watch movies on the fly, for $200 this device might be good for you.  On the other hand, if you went to see an Ipad, but thought you would find an Android alternative, it may be too soon, and the Archos 7 just can't match up.  I would suggest waiting for the Dell Streak, or one of the many other Android tablets coming out this year.  I really wanted to like the Archos, but it just didn't live up.

Copious This stand is very strong and if you are looking for a sturdy stand this is the one for you.  While it is a bit pricey you get what you pay for and you won't be sorry you bought this stand.

Company LIE about multi-touch feature plus wifi issue First let me say I am a big fan of android. I had nexus one before and currently owning Archos 70IT.I really happy when Elocity released A7. It comes Tegra 2 processor, 512MB RAM and multi-touch (as company say) this sound like awesome deal...on paper at least.I ordered one, and very excited when I received my A7.Elocity A7 is speed demon, extremely fast and responsive, then I found out that A7 has no HARDWARE MULTI-TOUCH support.On their website says it support multi-touch, this is FLAT OUT LIE....this confirmed by xda member using multi-touch test program. It only register single touch, no more.You can pinch to zoom only on original browser that comes with it with jerky movement, other than that you are on your own.On top of that I also having issue with wifi, it will turn off by itself after device waking up. When I try to turn it back on, it goes back to airplane mode. The only way to fix this problem is rebooting it. This happened every time device goes to sleep.She is going back to her mama today :(From xda forum I read that elocity will release 2nd generation next year with real multi-touch support, until then I will keep my archos 70IT. Its getting better and better with update firmware :P

Dissapointing If you have ever used an ipad and you try this, you will be very dissapointed; it freezes, goes slow, is hard to figure out, etc. Compared to an ipad.

Piece of Junk, Save Your Money for Something Better! UPDATE (April 15, 2011): When I first wrote this review I was willing to give the Cruz reader a try and did a variety of things to try and get it to where I want it to be. Keep in mind when I say this that I didn't use any hacks that might upset or break the operating system. The only thing I did was to look far and wide for apps that would work on this thing. In some cases, I contacted actual companies for the .apk files of their Android apps since that seems to be the only way we can really install apps on the Cruz.Well it's April now, and in Jan. I was learning to love the Cruz reader. Now however, I would give it a negative score if Amazon would allow it. This device is the worst piece of junk you could probably spend your money on in the tablet market. I decided to keep my needs simple and went after a few apps which I verified would work with Android 2.0. For a while everything was fine. I was using it to track our monthly bills, manage our Paypal account, create grocery lists, read and occasionally view our own website for testing purposes. I even purchased a few apps using SlideMe marketplace. Then a few weeks ago, I experienced an issue where I had to restart my Cruz. All this involved was holding down the power button to power the device off. Then it wouldn't come back on. I had to open the back, disconnect the battery for about 30 sec. and then try again. After that, everything seemed to be fine. Then about 4 nights ago I was using the included browser to search for a .apk file for HootSuite's app. I found what I needed but couldn't install because I didn't have enough space. So I went into the console to manage my apps in the hopes of deleting a few that I don't ever use. The first thing that upsets me is that certain apps that come pre-installed with the Cruz can't be uninstalled! I never use Napster, or Facebook Mobile or Twidroyd or the office suite. But there are no options to uninstall any of them. And together, they take up quite a bit of space. I had even purchased Twidroyd Pro for more functionality, but the app requires that you first uninstall the free version for the paid version to work. Of course, Cruz won't let you uninstall but you don't necessarily know that upfront, so I spent money on an app I couldn't use all because Velocity doesn't know how to make a functional product!I was about to exit the manage apps console when I began receiving errors like "keyboard has encountered and error and needs to force close." I received similar errors for the browser and another component (not even sure what that one was). So I thought if I powered the Cruz off and cut it back on, all would be well. SO NOT THE CASE. Since then, whenever I try to cut the Cruz on it stays on the initial screen for quite a while, then it moves to the screen that says Android but never finishes loading up. The shine will go across the letters a couple of times and then stop, the screen will go black, and then it will start all over again. I've even tried disconnecting the battery for a while and then going through the process again, only to have the same issue.A few important notes: I've never dropped the thing, never gotten it wet, never let it overheat, always use the proper charger and only installed apps designed for Android 2.0. Apparently taking good care of your device doesn't seem to matter. It's gone down now and doesn't seem to be any way to fix it. All I can say is, I'm so glad I got this from Best Buy. I know I can get it fixed without having to fork over any money. Because if I couldn't I'd just trash the thing.I'm also rather upset at the fact that I had to spend $10 extra dollars on a few styluses just to make the touch-screen capabilities work. If it truly needs a stylus to work best, why not just include one? Even now, Velocity Micro promotes this thing as if you can treat it like an actual touch-screen when you really can't...well, not with your finger anyway. I shouldn't have to go out and purchase something that's not even made or offered by your company just to make your product work. That's ridiculous. that's like me having to go out and purchase a keyboard to make my laptop work. Purchasing an extra for external use is one thing. Being forced to purchase one just to use the thing would be a completely different issue.Velocity should probably just stick to computers (and I'm not sure how well they do with those to be honest, never heard of them until the Cruz). This now seems like an unfinished product they just tossed into the market to try and compete. Never mind that users were bound to have problems with the product not working well (or at all). It makes no sense that this thing went down in just 3 and a half months. I own several devices and always take exceptional care of them. So I KNOW it wasn't me on this one. If you haven't purchased yet, DON'T. There are way better options out now. I wish I had waited. I'll be getting another device soon which has Android 2.2 and way more features (like a camera) in the next couple of months. If I were any of you considering the Cruz, I would save my money for something better. The tablet I'll be getting is priced about the same as Velocity's other tablet (the one that's close to $200. But it does way more, has a camera, has access to the Android Market and will allow flash & 3d gaming. When you consider all of that, none of the options that seem to be the most popular in the US are worth their cost.____________________________________________________________________________________________________Original Review from Jan. 2011First off, let me start this review by expressing that I'm not one of those customers who expected the Cruz to perform like the iPad or Galaxy Tab. Of course, once you've used either of those devices for any length of time your expectations are automatically set for better experience. I'd also like to make it clear that I tend to be a little more techy than most, so some of the "fixes" others have suggested are fine for me, but may be too much to deal with for someone who's a little less techy.I do, however, feel that if a company expects a product to compete in the eReader / Tablet market that certain key features need to be up to par. So I'm going to break this review down into how the Cruz performs as an eReader and as a Tablet and hopefully this will help those of you deciding which to get.General Thoughts:I haven't had any problems with WiFi connectivity as others have mentioned. I connected with no problems the first time and haven't been booted off since. It seems to automatically find the network whenever rebooted, and doesn't seem to conflict with any of our other WiFi devices.How the Cruz Performs as an eReader:To start off, we have both the Borders and Kindle apps available (the Borders app comes installed, and the Kindle app is available for download from the Cruz Market). This makes the new readers more palatable from the start. I remember seeing a lot of complaints when the Cruz first came onto the market about customers not having access to the Kindle app. I'm glad Velocity saw the light on that one.Reading goes slowly (an unfortunate thing since this is primarily a digital reader). The touch screen functionality keeps this from being a good reader, in my opinion. I installed the firmware update and calibrated the reader before doing anything else, and currently have it calibrated at Excellent. But that doesn't seem to do much good. You cannot "tap" or "swipe" to go to the next page as the Quick Start Guides suggests. Instead, you have to press and hold or drag to go from page to page. Sometimes, it's so off that it will actually go back a page rather than forward (despite the fact that I'm pressing in the area for the next page). I've also had quite a few issues with the bar that holds the home, back and search buttons coming up and covering the first one or two lines of text so that I have to wait to begin reading once I've made it to the next page. This makes reading a little inconvenient, but it's something I've learned to deal with as I don't plan on taking the unit back.I do like the functions that allow you to change text size and background. Those seem to work fine. I haven't yet tested out PDF readers, but intend to within the week.How the Cruz Performs as a Tablet:One thing to remember about this is that it's not meant to be a full tablet. But even keeping that in mind, I feel that Velocity has a lot that can be improved on even for what this device is truly meant to be. As I mentioned before, the touch screen leaves a lot to be desired. The keyboard combined with the lacking touch screen means you have to really press to get the letters going. I've only experimented with searching and updating my status on Facebook, but that was slow-going with the keyboard / touch screen issues. I can imagine that trying to type full emails will really be a hassle. It also makes pulling up menus and clicking on links to different pages frustrating.The fact that this reader comes with Android 2.0 (with no hope of an update to the latest version in the foreseeable future) is a big minus. From my point of view, there was really no reason for Velocity to skimp on this. But the fact that you can get Skyfire (for viewing flash, video etc.) and have access to some Android apps through the Android Freeware site makes this a little easier to deal with. What I don't understand is why we don't have access to the Android Market. From what I understand, the Market comes with Android versions 1.6 and up. So it almost seems like Velocity did the extra work to remove the Market from the software. My only guess is that their more expensive tablet comes with the Market, so they removed it from the less expensive device to encourage sales of the more expensive one. That's a real disappointment considering everything else. If I'd had a better experience with this the eReader, it might have encouraged me to upgrade to the more expensive tablet in a few months anyway. But now, if I go for anything else in this market it will likely not be from this company. Their tactic where the Android Market is concerned will probably be their undoing.Like others have said, if you can find the .apk files for the Market and other common apps you'll be ok. The .apk files aren't hard to install as long as you have an SD card with enough space. But finding them is a real problem. I've been searching for quite a while for working .apk files for the Market as well as apps like AppBrain, but with no luck. I'd planned on using my Cruz for a bit of work as well as pleasure and have managed to get most of the apps I need (Paypal, Amazon, Skyfire etc.). But I can't get a few of the key productivity apps I need, so I won't be able to do much in the way of work other than checking and responding to emails, testing websites and setting appointments.Sound quality isn't great, but it's better with sound-boosting headphones. Video playback from sites like YouTube is pretty poor (it wouldn't let me access the HQ quality videos). Viewing in Landscape mode is better for video than than portrait mode. Shifting modes isn't choppy for me as others have complained about. I just had to learn that it only shifts on 2 sides and not all the way around like the iPad.Overall, it wasn't a horrible buy for the money (paid $119 a few days after Christmas), but it wouldn't have been as worth if for $169 or $179, especially not when a few of the better eReader / Table combos are just $100 or so more. This would be great for kids in school who need access to books for their reading lists (especially the classics, which are all free on Kindle now), or for light web surfing while waiting at the doctor's office or traveling. Don't expect to use this for heavy work or business as it's fairly useless without access to needed apps. If you care to search for the .apk files for the Market, better PDF readers and a better keyboard, the device is likely to work much better for you. Just remember, if you expect what you paid for and not what you hope it to be, you'll enjoy the Cruz a lot.

Excellent media player The Archos 43 is an excellent media player. It does a great job of handling audio and video and the kickstand is handy. My son got a MachSpeed TRIO as an inexpensive ($100) media player. The TRIO had a poor resistive screen and become unusable within a few months. In comparison, the Archos 43 costs a bit more ($170) but the it has a much better resistive touch screen, has a better screen and sound, and supports more media types. Besides being a media player, my son enjoys having an android device and likes all the free games he can get. Hooking it up to our wifi was easy and we have even turned it into a very useful wifi phone using Google Voice and Groove IP. Groove IP was easy to setup and works well once you get the settings right.I also have a Viewsonic G tablet. That is a 10 inch capacitive touch screen. As a tablet, the archos 43 isn't as good. Capacitive touch screens are just better and the processor in the Archos 43 does fine but it is not nearly as powerful as the Viewsonic G. If what you really want is a full powered tablet you should look elsewhere, although this does make a nice low cost wifi tablet.We purchases a cheap case from Amazon that holds the Archos nicely, can fold shut to protect it, and has a stand of its own. For $12 it was a great buy. It also has a place for a stylus and my son uses an extra stylus he has from his DS. The touch screen is okay with a finger but a stylus works better. We purchased some cheap screen protectors (made for the PSP Slim) and they fit great. We bought an 8GB microSD card and, all in all, we spent about $200 for the Archos and accessories.My son is thrilled with the Archos 43 and my other son is now thinking about getting one. If you want a full featured media player with bonuses (Android) that is small (easy to carry) yet big enough for watching video then this is a great buy. I've never used an iPod but I can't imaging it could be better than this and I don't think you can get one with accessories for this price. We didn't even consider an iPod because we didn't want to be locked into their media service.UPDATE: We have purchased a Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0 and it is an amazing. The Archos 43 was a huge improvement over the TRIO (which is junk) but the Galaxy Player is a huge improvement over the 43. At this point, I wouldn't spend money on a 43. The Galaxy Player is just too nice and I got one for $190.

Lasted 6 months then died We bought this is June 2013 for my daughters birthday. She has taken excellent care of it.... it was kept in a case and never handled roughly. In fact she TREASURED this.  It was great WHILE IT LASTED.... now it is December of 2013 and it will no longer turn on. There is a green line down the middle... and that is all she gets.I am VERY disappointed.... and she is crushed.

Thank you sir, may I have another? There's a little pain before the reward, but it's worth it!My Archos 43 was a Christmas gift that my parents chose from my Amazon Wish List. Of course with the supply problems, I didn't actually get it until January 22nd. (It was ordered in November.)I'll be using it to replace my 8 year old and failing Palm Tungsten C PDA.You won't need my decades of engineering and programming background to make your Archos work, but you will have a glitch or two during the updating and software installation process. Just hang in there!Out of the very well packaged box came my Archos, a USB cable, ear buds and the paperwork. My first impression of the unit was the solid construction. It doesn't feel cheap and flimsy like so many products do now days. Turning the unit on, I found the battery at 60% charge. Following the manufacturers instructions, I let the unit charge for several hours to top off the battery.Once charged, the unit took me through a very simple set-up routine that only took a few minutes to complete. My Archos connected right away to my home wireless network, and indeed I can use my Archos 43 everywhere on my hobby farm. I've been over 200 feet from my router and still had very good reception.First things first - Let your unit go out and find the updated firmware and install it. The download took about 5 minutes. After the Archos reboots with Froyo, the real fun starts.After initial setup, select the "Market" icon and download the Arctools widget (which is called: com.arctablet.arctools.apk) and install it on your machine. This will give you the official Android marketplace and allow you to download the Adobe Flash 10.1 driver. This was important to me, as my pad will be used to monitor a 24hr ustream channel that I run.Note: I had to do this process twice before Marketplace would work. The first install seemed fine but Marketplace wouldn't launch. Uninstalling and reinstalling Arctools did the trick.Next of course, you'll want to add any other cool software that you fancy. I track satellites, keep ham radio logs  and read Kindle books on my new Archos (to name a few.)I'm not crazy about the audio player interface, however there are many others to choose from in the Marketplace so no worries on that. Sound quality is very good (to my over 50 ears) and video playback is smooth with the audio in sync. I run the very old Windows 2000 operating system, as well as Ubuntu 10.10 and both systems see the Archos 43 just fine. Dragging and dropping audio, video and picture files into the device is a breeze.I've also been able to stream movies and audio directly from my 4tb networked file server. Of course this will eat your batteries pretty quick. Best to just watch video directly from the Archos with wifi turned off.If you're up to it, download the Eclipse compiler and Android software development kit and start writing some of your own apps. It's not that hard and there's nothing like writing your own software.After using my Archos for 24 hours, I can truthfully say that I would, and probably will buy another. My wife and adult son are already asking for one of their own.-----------------------------------Two Month Follow-upI've had my Archos 43 for a couple of months now. I still love it.Battery life is great and I've had almost no trouble with it. Every once in awhile, an app will cause a complete freeze (App's fault, not the Archos) but holding the power button for 10 seconds will force a reboot and all is well again.The Google Marketplace patch works great, though I've found some apps that are marked not compatible with the Archos actually are. I'll get the appp directly from the author and side load it and it'll work just fine.Would I buy another one? YES and I will soon!-----------------------------------3 month updateI bought another one, but the reason stinks. I got fumble-fingered and dropped my Archos. Of course, like buttered toast, it fell screen side down onto a piece of angle iron in my metal shop and destroyed the screen. Needless to say, I went right to Amazon and got another one, as I've become so attached to it I can't live without it!I'll check into having my broken one fixed, as the display itself is fine and it boots up fine. I'll give it to my wife when it's fixed...

Pretty cool!! aVelocity Micro T103 Cruz 7-Inch Android 2.0 Tablet (Black)I received my Velocity Micro T103 Cruz just today and it was "Refurbished" so I guess that is why I couldn't turn it on at first, but as soon as I plugged it in to the wall plug it did turn on and it began to charge..  It took about 5 hours to fully charge and I'm hoping that it won't take that long next time...  Ok besides that..This tablet is very responsive, pretty amazing, I think.. It pretty much looked BRAND NEW!! Thank you "Remington Retail"  I just can't wait to see how much this tablet can do, I have no wi-fi in my home, but when I do get to access wi-fi, I promise I will update and let you all know, how awesome I'm sure it will work...I wanted to add, my 12 year old never stopped telling me that this tablet would be "cheesy" well, now she is crying and she will have to wait until Christmas.. LOL!!!!The reason for the 4 stars is because I haven't been able to use wi-fi and fully play with it yet, but so far so Awesome!! :)REVIEW CONTINUED:I finally have Wi-fi!! At first every time I typed something in the search engineand hit enter, it would go right back to the search engine and it was gettingextremely annoying and I thought the product was damaged, well thanks to mywonderful 12 year old daughter, she went to the following link on the "Velocity Micro Cruz website and found this quick and easy repair.Why does my browser close every time it loads Google?Affects tablets:  * T100 series tablets  * T301 tablets[...]It was unbelievable how quickly it began to work.  So yay it works perfectly fineafter that.YOUTUBE..  My cruz tablet happens to be a 2.2 so I downloaded the appropriate app for it from the Cruz Market and yes you can see youtube videos but not all of them, the resolution isn't that great either but it does work on some videos and I was pleased, still need to figure out if there is a way to save the videos or download them on the cruz so you can watch without being online. I don't have an sd card slot on my desktop computer so I hope I can find another way.THE SCREEN.  The screen gets dirty immediately when touched, smears all over the screen, that is one thing that I'm not to thrilled about at all, it seems that it can never look clean unless you don't use it at all. LolOh one more thing, every so often you do need to put a pin or needle on top of the cruz, you will see the little reset hole.I am pretty happy with my little tablet!! :)

Awesome Slate, Replaces my Convertible Tablet August 2011 Update1.Great news Microsoft appears to be hearing the cry's of the people to create an amazing tablet user interface.  Check out the youtube titled "Building "Windows 8" - Video #1."  The rumor is that Microsoft will try to make windows 8 compatible with machines running windows 7.  The key issue with this HP Tablet is the screen resolution. From Wikipedia "The new interface is primarily designed for 16:9 screen resolutions, with 1366768 and larger screens able to display two Windows 8 applications. 1024768 screens can display one Windows 8 application in full-screen, and 1024600 screens can only use the traditional Windows desktop." The HP slate runs 1024 x 600 as its native resolution but it can run 1024 x768.  So the hope is that the HP Slate will be able to run windows 8 and the future software that will be written for windows 8.2. Increase the scroll bars (making them fatter) can help improve the windows 7 user interface.  Sometimes the scroll bar is covered by the leather case but by making the scroll bar fatter you can move up and down web pages a little easier.Right-click on desktop, select Personalize.Click on "Window Color" and then "Advanced appearance settings." In he drop-down list choose scrollbar (or click on the scrollbar in the picture) and finally change the size. Check the entire drop-down list for the items you wish customize by size and fonts.3. Swiftpoint SM300 Laptop Mouse works well with the tablet. It is small, comfortable and portable.  The rollerball allows for better scrolling with large documents and more intense work.  Again, just plug and play usb device.4.Rotating your screen 180: You can switch horizontal sides so that the AC Plug is on the top of the device instead of the bottom when charging.  Right-click on the desktop,click "Graphic Options" then "Rotation" and choose your side. 180 flips it. You can also change this in the control panel, "Display" "Change Display Settings" "Orientation"5. HP Slate continues to be stable: Noticed other new windows slate devices were having trouble with their operating system with bugs and shutting down.  My HP may freeze up just as typical as windows 7 laptops. Otherwise it is very stable. Pressing the CTRL Alt Delete (all-in-one) button on the side of the slate seems to break up any frozen screens.So would I continue to buy HP 500 (August 2011)?Still to this date.  IPADS are not standalone computer, don't have flash video capabilities, needs lots of apps to fill in for office, and no plug-n-play with devices (only those built for IPAD), missing drivers to many printers. Android may be better than IPAD as it does have Flash video, the ability to store documents (file system) and sd/micro sd expansion. HP 500 is a windows 7 computer with a slower "not snazzy" tablet user interface but now with the hope for windows 8 if the device can be upgraded.  But what does Apple have for IPAD3 and when will it be released, October or now 2012? Presently, when I travel, I don't want two devices, I would buy the HP 500 still, with the potential delay of IPAD 3 and Windows 8 without a release date, the HP remains the travel companion that allows for relaxation (music, movies)play, intense work (stand alone office (no cloud connection needed) and security (known/free virus protection).Happy tableting!Start of old review.I have had my tablet for the past month plus.  I am a heavy tablet user and have had tablets for the past 5 years.  (Motion Computing, Lenovo convertible).  I thought hard about buying the IPAD, I held back and I was so happy that I did.  Everyone, I talk to that has an IPAD says that it does not do what a computer does.  I am tired of getting an item and finding out that I have to find all of the work arounds (extra apps) to do what my slate does for me. I am a heavy pc user and have found that this tablet has replaced my Lenovo Convertible tablet.  I use my HP to get my work done, surface the web, enjoy movies, listen to music and then get out and ENJOY LIFE by moving around and socializing with real people!PROS:1.WEIGHT: HP Slate weighs 1.5 lbs with the pen and nice case 1 lb 10oz.  Any item that gets to 2 lbs is too heavy to carry.  The screen is big enough to do work. I think the power cable is 9oz?? Most newer tablets are pushing 3lbs which is the SAME as a LAPTOP. A Laptop, that lasting 2hrs forces you to carry the power cable 1lb, too heavy to carry in your bag.2.Your Software works: NO finding work arounds and converting file formats from Android/IPAD3.No DVD drive:  I have a portable DVD drive so I plugged it in, the driver installed.  But for software, you can download the trial versions off the web and then use your key to unlock your programs3.Windows 7 Professional: Quick, seems as fast as my Lenovo Convertible Tablet.  But I have not done heavy work such as video editing on this machine.  I have had 7 programs opened and have not had any problems in speed.4. Office 2010: Word works great, PowerPoint awesome, OneNote wonderful. Excel as usual.  But I haven't pushed EXCEL or the other software in the bundle yet.5.Other Favorites: Snippingtool: Lets you take a picture of anything on your screen; Cutepdf: Free pdfprinter on line; Freemind Mindmap, Stickies, Picasa to alter photos5. Free AVG or AVAST Antivirus6. Printer: Set up your PC printer as usual. Lexmark 901 wireless.  Downloaded the driver from the website and installed.  I suspect my other printers will install as this is windows.7. Web Browsing: Explorer or Mozilla.  All my web programs work, gotomeeting, toodledo.com.8. FLASH YES, Youtube, HULU, watch my favorite shows online.9. SD Memory Card: Can upload your photos from you camera.  Have a 32GB ($50). Increases memory from built-in 60GB to 92GB.  So much can be stored in the cloud which frees up space on the tablet.10.USB slot: Plug and play my CURRENT Windows items.  Drivers are there. USB Mouse, microphones, storage drives, phone charger.  No searching the web looking for a work around with my existing tech gadgets. Many items running android and IPAD do not have the drivers for accessories11.Wireless: I have no problems connecting at work, starbucks, coffee shops, home.Bluetooth: Connected my old Foldout Stowaway keyboard (didn't have to spend another $100).  Figured out how connect my jawbone but the sound quality is not great to listen to music.  Probably ok for Skype calls.12.MIC/Headset/Speakers:  The Speakers are loud enough to listen for personal use in a room similar to a hotel room.  They don't have base but they are not as tinty as some can sound.  When you plug in a good speaker or headset the sound is great.  The internal MIC is fine for Skype calls or recording such as on ONENOTE.13.SKYPE: Works fine.  It was hard for the Skype to detect the camera.  I got frustrated and tried to install my Logitech external webcam.  When I did this, Skype then saw the HP cameras.  In the Skype settings, video you can select the camera because you have a front and back.  If you use a Bluetooth headset, first connect the headset using the windows Bluetooth icon, "Add a Device."  If you wish to only listen and speak using your Bluetooth, you have to "disable" your default speakers, open the "horn" icon, right click on the "playback", select the speakers, right click, select disable.  This will force the sound into your headset only.  Then go into the Skype audio settings and choose the Bluetooth mic and speaker.  The video camera works but you will need high speed to really get good video quality.14.Battery Life: Last for 5 hrs.  I can go to meetings and sit in coffee shops for hours until I need to plug in.  Before with a laptop, I could only last 1-2 hrs.15.Camera quality is fair.  It doesn't get moving people as well.  If it is a stationary item it does ok.  The video works also.  I get better quality on my SPRINT EVO.  The camera is nice to capture something quick to add into a document.So, this is how I use my tablet.I go to 3 hr meetings, record information using the stylus or type using my foldout keyboard.  I go to a preschool sites (evaluate safety and nutrition). Hook into their wireless or Tether to SPRINTEVO (haven't needed to yet), get reports, take photos of what I see if necessary, write notes on my ONENOTE, printpdf the report, send it to the teacher by email.  She prints the document if necessary.  Other instances, I can complete a surveymonkey as a report gathering tool and submit it. I have training video, I can show a teacher on the spot.  I go to a coffee shop with free wireless, plug in my headset (Pandora), plug in my wireless mouse, pull out the Bluetooth keyboard and use office and answer emails.  I could also make SKYPE Calls if needed.  Go back to the office, plug into my screen (see below) and it becomes a regular computer.  For movies, I use to copy my DVDs that I purchased with software and loaded them on to my portable hard drives and download the movies that I want to see.  But I just watch online (remember flash).Why buy this device if I have to pull out all of the extra gadget (keyboard, mouse).  It's because of the weight. I can walk around with just the slate comfortably when I want or need to which you can't do with a netbook or laptop.WorkaroundsNo VGA port: There is HDMI on the docking station.  HP please find a spot on the device, then I don't need to carry the dock and preferably on the short side.  I bought the HP HDMI to VGA converter for $39 in the HP Home section.  It works with old VGA ports. You need the converter for VGA as you are going from digital back to analogue.  But many projectors and TVs are HDMI or DVI (HDMI without the sound).  You can get an adapter for HDMI to DVI for projectors too. You might need a 3.5 audio to cable out. I never use the speakers from a projector. I have external speakers which provide better quality or I feed into the AV System. Used the HDMI cable with a projector and it was beautiful.  You could project your movies or use it as a large screen.  I am sure if you were in a hotel, carry your HDMI and plug into the Flat screen, carry your Bluetooth keyboard and work from bed. Or show your personal movies for yourself or kids.No Ethernet: I don't use my Ethernet much.  Yes my Agency has this but doesn't let us plug our personal items into their system.  There is a HP USB to ethernet adapter for $39 if this is a needed.Stylus: You will need 4AAAA batteries.  BEWARE; I scratched the screen with the stylus.  It is a quarter inch scratch. Don't know how it happened. I don't see it when the screen is on.Screen: Nice Glass. The case is designed to accommodate the cameras.  I flip it around in the case when I want to stand the HP like a Teepee.  The bummer is when you plug in and don't have the dock you have to prop it up against a bag.  You can only rotate the screen on two sides where other tablets let your rotate to any side. It is true that the leather can get in the way on the side to move scroll bars.  But learn how to use the "FLICK" setting and you don't need the scroll bars.  I still use my key commands of CTRL + or - to increase or decrease the screen.  The finger zoom is not as good as newer device.Screen set up.  Because your palm can rest on the bottom part of the screen, I set my windows taskbar on the top screen instead of the bottom so I don't open the Clock by accident.  I also docked the INPUT panel on the task bar.  When it is docked on the sides, it can block items.  Learn how to go use your "Flick" settings which help you use your fingers on the tablet.  Also, right click on the N Trig DuoSense Pen Icon in the taskbar tray, select properties.  Here you can turn off the capacitive screen and use only the pen such as in ONENOTE or Windows JOURNAL.  So you can rest your palm of your hand on the screen and it won't draw scribbly lines.Overall, this was the best purchase technology wise that I have made in years.  I have invested much to try out new tech gadgets.  This does it all.  It is not perfect in the touch screen interface but it is an improvement from the earlier tablets.  Yes, it cost more ~$850 but I don't have to buy more apps and I can use what I have from my windows computers.  In the end, it is what the tablet CAN DO that matters.HP, you have a winner.  I wish you went toe-to-toe with the IPAD, you could have punched hard!  Don't do what Microsoft always does.  Create something good and then let another company create and market another product off their original good creation.  It's the size, screen, weight and operating system! If you don't like it, return it.  It took me 2.5 months to get mine because they sold out.  I am sure someone will want to buy it off you.Conclusion:Weight 1.5 lbs, battery life 5 hrs, no workaround apps, uses my current windows gadgets, prints to printers, usb and SD Memory, Outputs to projectors and monitors using HDMI, wireless, bluetooth, can tether to Phone hotspots. It truly replaces my Laptop for light Office work and entertainment.This is all I carry now.  Computer, tablet (alter graphics, draw, SIGN Legal Documents), DVD Player, MP3 Player, Camera, Video Camera, Phone Skype, Memory Storage, Scanner (take a photo of your document), FAX (use online faxes by attaching documents)3 Months to date: Still Love my HP Slate.Issues:-Slightly slower than my laptop.  For an Atom processor, I am still impressed.-The touch interface is not as responsive as the android (the nook) or Ipad.  I might have to click twice or use my pen.  The pinch and zoom is not as smooth where I don't use it often.-The Stylus is slippery and slipped out my hand and.  The tip bent.  I was able to order another on from the HP Parts department.  Each stylus cost $45.  I purchased 2, so if I lose one, I have a backup.  You have to use the HP Stylus because N-TRIG is designed for the slate. I also purchased a cheap plastic pen cushion to have better grip.-Major issue: After updating explorer, something happened and the tablet started up, asking to choose safe mode or normal in that Old "dos" looking screen. Since I can only pull up the keyboard when windows 7 is loaded when the desktop is showing, I couldn't select my option. I tried to shutdown7 but it restarted to the same screen. I plugged in a USB keyboard and was able to choose "start windows" using the arrow keys and windows 7 booted normally. So the issue is with tablets you need to have access to a usb-keyboard for emergency. I leave on old one in my carWhy do I still love it?-Watch my shows that I missed.  CBS runs better in the Google Chrome browser. Converted my videos to watch when I want to.  Used the HDMI cable and the output looks awesome.  But I did use my Tower Desktop to convert the video.  Don't know how the tablet would perform with intense number crunching.-Storage Space: 60 GB on Hard drive.  30GB on my SD Memory.  So I have 90GB.  I had to download a ton of photos when I didn't have internet access.-Plug and Play Printing.  I needed to print something at work, so I just plugged in my retractable USB printer cable.  Windows installed the driver automatically and I was ready.  When I traveled last month, I realized when I was at the computer center of the hotel, I could have just plugged into that printer and probably printed.  It's nicer to just work on my own computer for security purposes rather than signing in and downloading a document on the hotels computer.-Security: Updates to Windows 7 Professional and Free AVG are done on a regular basis.  Security is just beginning to be addressed on the android platform.-Cost. $850, plus extra stylus $45, $39 HDMI to VGA Adapter, $50 for 32GB SD Card, reused $100 Bluetooth keyboard, $45 extra ac adapter. It is about $1000 but it is so worth it.Most Android or IPADs require you to have another computer. I still use only my HP.  I plug it into my screen, use my Bluetooth Keyboard and plug in my USB Wireless mouse and I forget that I have a tablet and I now working off a desktop.Happy tableting!

Ultra portable pc Works as expected The accelerometer can be glitchy and so screen rotation does not work. But this could also be a win7 driver issue. Overall satisfied with the product.

Just a review from another convert to the Ipad I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the "new" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or "apps" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it "right now" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****.

Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never "needed" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.

 Length:: 2:29 MinsSure there are many ipad2 reviews on Amazon.  Why watch my video?  I'm showing you how to use this like real people use it, not like some sales person.  Is it worth the money?  For me it is.  It's small; it's portable; it has fast Internet; it's simple - what more can you ask for?  I take this with me wherever I go.  Most of the time it replaces my phone.  O boy, watching movies on the ipad 2 is so much cooler than watching it on the phone.

Just a review from another convert to the Ipad I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the "new" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or "apps" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it "right now" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****.

Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never "needed" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.

Just a review from another convert to the Ipad I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the "new" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does).

Wi-Fi a disappointment on iPad 2 I received a black iPad 2 with 32 GB for my birthday from my lovely wife. It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.But not with the iPAD 2.with the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.This is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.BELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:BTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.2. It was too big and heavy.3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their "return" "credit" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a "magic cover" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The "magic cover" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for "repair." I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a "new" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a "refurbished" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a "new" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the "frame" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.It's black and white, but that's OK with me.It's small and light weight and very easy to use.The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you "buy" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.Anyway, if you're interested in an "eReader" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using "streaming" because of the networking issue.

Keep things in context, this is a $150 tablet, not a $700 iPad --------------UPDATE----------------So five months after i bought the Coby 7015, it still goes strong. It has this annoying sleep/wake thing if you dont turn it off that drains the batteries, and occasionally i have to reset it, but once again for the price i can not give it less than 5 stars.However, i recently recieved the Acer A500 tablet (roughly 450 bucks) and i have to say it absolutly kills the Coby tablet in terms of performance in every aspect, the thing is awesome and an absolute joy to use. At 4 times the price that is to be expected, but if you can squeeze out the extra $300 or so, there are some darn good tablets coming out right now that are excellent alternatives to the iPad.------------------------------Review of Coby 7015 Tablet.I got one of these as a 10 year anniversary gift from my company. I probably would have never bought one otherwise. All in all, i think this is an awesome little device for what it is.I see a lot of things repeatedly addressed, other things are not, im going to try to go over every feature on this.Please forgive my terrible spelling. ;)When rating this i am comparing this to my samsung galazxy S droid phone, Ipads, Iphones, and Ipod touches all of which i have used many times.==========OVERALL BUILD QUALITY=========Good! This does not feel like a tiny junky piece of crap like i half expected. While it does not have the build quality of an Ipad, it does not feel like a little childs toy either. the buttons are solid and have a nice snappy responce to them. The Mini USB, HDMI, and DC input all seem like well built sockets, and i have no doubt they will stand the test of time. The back is a hard shell with a small speaker and reset button. It has a decent heft to it that implies stoutness, but it is light enough to carry around all day. All in all, much better than the sub $150 price tag lead you to expect. I dont like the MicroSD, there is no reason for that, they could have easily used standard SDHC cards, plus i have about a dozen SDHC cards lying around, but only one microsd. Keep the micro SD cards in the phones folks.=============SCREEN============== - This is the biggest point of interest to many, and probably glossed over with the least amount of information. As has been mentioned this is a resistive screen. This is NOT the same type of screen as your Ipod, Iphone, Ipad, or Droid phones or Tablets. Those devices use capacitive screens which flat out rock. The resistive screen is not as good, but it is important to know that this screen is NOT Frustrating either! It really works well!  If this is NOT your experience, i suspect a faulty unit.A) Touch and Feel - The wonderful capacitive screens feel like glass. This one feels like plastic, and like plastic it has more drag on your fingertips. The resistive screens seem to have several layers sandwiched together so they are not that flat hard surface, but slightly mushy.  It does not feel as nice as the capacitive screens, it feels like older technology. The slight mushyness actually does give you somewhat of a fingertip-fatigue over time, where the capacitive (droid/iphone/ipad) screens are always a pleasure and do not tire your fingertips. I know that last part sounded rediculous, if you buy this device you will know what i mean.B) Responsiveness - Very good for a resistive screen, in fact, this is the most impressive resistive screen i have ever used. I used to have an old LG Incite phone a few years back, it had a resistive screen and it was an absolute horrible experience to use. I was very pessimistic about this device because of the screen but once i started using it it worked just fine.  It DOES come with a stylus, sometimes you will find that more comfortable, however it does seem to respond just fine to finger swipes and the stylus is absolutly not required.  If on a scale of 1-10 with the LG Incite touchscreen being a 1, and the Ipad screen being a 10, this sits at a solid 8. It just isnt quite there, but like i said, this is the best resistive screen i have ever seen.C) Resolution and Color.  Not bad. The color has a slight bluish tint, almost like an uncalibrated Dell laptop screen. You photos will seem to be lacking some of the poppy reds, yellows, and oranges.  So if you are a photographer like i am, forget using this as a device to showcase your images, stick with your Ipad,Iphone,Droid. I have looked for a color correction App, so far, no dice.  Resolution is 480p, this is DVD quality, for a 7 inch screen this is plenty, however if it is a foot from your face you do see all the little pixels.========= AUDIO ==============its a cheap tiny speaker like the kind found in blackberries, droids, ipods, etc. Nothing special, the sound is weak and tinny like any other speaker of that size, but the quality is not overly objectionable if there are no other options. It is great for podcasts, youtube, etc, but it falls far short of a KRELL HEAT system... as expected. ;)========BATTERY LIFE==========Maybe it is just mine? The battery indicator on my Kyros is all over the map, 98% one second, 32 the next, then 75%, then 63% then 80%. use it as a guide. it apparently has no idea exactly how much juice is left. I suspect it is trying to give you an idea of how much battery life is left depending on the amount of applications running? Even the battery managers on this thing are all over the board. In the end, i can score 5-6 hours of internet surfing. The screen and tablet stay nice and cool. Maybe this is a benefit of the resistive screen, less power consumption? this is just a guess.==========APPSLIB APPS MARKET===========THIS IS THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS DEVICE The apps in thier apps lib market are generally crap, i diddnt find much of anything i was interested in. some of the bigger games like angry birds are there, but there are many others im interested in that dont exist.  There are 165,000+ applications for the android platform, so why the hell should you be limited to about 3,000 in the apps lib? plus they are 3,000 of the crap apps nobody wants. basic stuff like some facebook apps, email apps, are there, but other than that it is mostly junk.But guess what? there is a light at the end of the tunnel!  This device can easily be rooted, once it is rooted you can install some nice software to back it up, and once that is there you can side-load applications. Such as... THE GOOGLE APP MARKET! Yes! This is awesome! All 165,000 apps i want are now available!The problem is you have to root the device (gets superuser permissions) install the backup software (which also enables application installation outside of the apps application itself and to keep a digital backup image of your device, very nice). And to do this you literally have to add a few lines of code(not nearly as scary as it sounds i promise! once of the easiest parts), you have to download several different files all of which seem to require you to sign up to various forum boards and stuff to get.i did this. I am not a hacker by any means, in fact, im an idiot ask anybody, i dont understand most of what i was doing, other than the basic overall idea of what i wanted to accomplish. It took me several hours, mainly because of my ignorance on this kind of stuff. The key is to go one step at a time, if something is not working, search for an answer. There is a website that gives you step by step instructions, there are many posts on there of problems they ran into and solutions around them. Just google up the ULTIMATE KYROS 7015 and look for a website that is like XDA developers or something. it is a online forumboard where people figured out how to do this junk. It is on a forum thread, read through several pages, you will see what i mean, if you run into a problem, somebody else already has, and the answer will be in that thread somewhere.Once this is done, and you have google apps, it absolutly transforms your entire experience with this marvelous dirt cheap tablet because they stuff you WANT is all there for you. I highly highly reccommend doing this (at your own risk) and trust me, if I can do it, anybody can, just take your time, when you get stuck read ahead, somebody else probably had the same problem and figured out how to correct it and explains how.. It does require an MicroSD card though. There IS a Possility you will turn your tablet into a brick. however, from what i have seen, this almost never happens, you almost have to have a flawed device from the get-go, or be overly careless.=========OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY=========Not bad at all! Mine keeps waking itself up which is annoying, but it responds to my commands, has only frozen twice, which is more than i can say for most other devices.Keyboard - Not bad at all, works well, you get used to using two thumbs on it, you have to pace yourself and not get ahead of it, you can not type as fast as on a keyboard, but overall it seems pretty reliable. There is no vibration, so no haptic feedback which i enjoy on my samsung galaxy S phone.Pic viewer - As i said, slight bluish cast, it is slow loading up images too. I loaded a bunch of reduced sized images to my droid phone to display my photography to possible clients, i loaded them on the Kyros and it takes about 3-4 seconds for the pictures to really lock in onto full resolution. I was a bit disappointed by this because this thing has a great little processor in it. The Slideshow is about retarded because you can choose between 2-4 seconds on the intervals and the images never really crisp up, they stay the 1/2 resolution blurry versions because they change before the processor locks them in. stupid stupid stupid.ALDIKO e-reader.... if you want an e-reader go get a kindle or nook. that is my opinion. I briefly looked at it, it uses a backit screen, which stinks for extended reading. But the size of the text and font is pretty nice, you wont be squinting to read, and it would probably suffice for an e-reader, but it is nowhere as comfortable to look at as a kindle or nook.The Youtube video app - I dunno, i had a hard time getting this to work properly, then i rooted my Kyros and got the google marketplace installed and it came with a much better youtube app.Email - I am sorry, i did not even try this untill after i rooted my tablet, once the google marketplace was installed as part of the process it synched with my email. it works just fine.Widgets seem to work just fine. I have a Facebook widget, Weather channel widget, Google widget, and a battery widget, it does not seem to slow down with the use of any of them. You ccan use live wallpaper, it seems to run just fine with live wallpaper, i dont notice any lag.Video playback is smooth and crisp, the 480P quality is very much there.Wi-fi performance. The wi-fi on this runs as fast as my Dell Laptop, my Samsung Galaxy S Droid phone, or any other wireless device for that matter. It is not pant-leg-flapping insane fast, but certainly nothing to complain about. If this is NOT your experience, i suspect you have a faulty unit.===============Random things i noticed==============Twice now in 5 days it has crashed while i was typing. Not sure why.it keeps waking itself up. Not sure why. i have heared other reports, this may get fixed in a firmware update later.No volume control on the side, once again, what the hell? You have to set the volume BEFORE starting any videos.Charges VIA power cord..... will NOT charge through USB. I was actually suprised by this, maybe because it looks like a massive cellphone. That would have been nice. Go on google and look up Kyros 7015 tablet charger, and prepare to realize you will only have one. lolmore than once i had to reset the wif-fi in the device if it has been asleep for a while... annoying, but not a huge inconvenience. maybe a firmware upgrade will address this.===========Good Bad Ugly=======================Good -Very responsive resistive touchscreen.Excellent builtSolid performanceExpandable memoryFast capable Wi-FiUnder [...]BadResistive screen. (i just preffer capacitive)Slight bluish castNo volume controls on sideMicroSD card.. really? Micro? Cant just use SD cards which we all have laying around?UglyApplib. This just stinks. it requires rooting and such to get google market apps, and trust me google market apps is absolutly worth the effort, and it is not that difficult, and appslib just flat out sucks.============Conclusion==============I cant believe how much bang for your buck you get. This can be had for well under [...]!!!! a handheld lightweight internet browser that potentioally has access (if rooted) to 165,000+ applications, games, etc.  Anybody who complains that this device does NOT do enough for [...]  seriously needs to get thier heads examined.  Im suprised this is not sold for closer to [...].A few thoughts...To address a few points, one person wrote a review and said the batterys dont last long enough, they popped it open, saw the batteries, then decided to return it. No mention if they actually USED it though. 5-6 hours of internet browsing is not enough? Really? Show me a droid phone that has that kind of battery life on wi-fi, it is right up there with the Ipad. To say that 5-6 hours of battery life is not enough is flat out stupid, because nothing really has much more battery life than this! its reviews like those that i just dont understand. jump to conclusions rather than try it out yourself.Another person mention that it sucks because you have to root the device to get google apps and such. Well. True. Either do it or dont, Coby restricted the potential on this great tablet for some stupid reason that i could care less about, the fact is the option is there, take it or leave it. Those who are willing to do so will have a DRASTICALLY better experience than those who dont. If you dont want to root it and install google apps, then go spend [...] on the Galaxy S tablet (which looks awesome) or the iPad.  To be perfectly honest, i would only give this device a 3 star rating if the option to root was not there.Others complain about the screen, yes, it is not the same as the [...]Ipad. That is why it costs [...] less. Not sure why you would expect to get a ferarri at a honda civic price tag.If price was not considered in the rating at all, i would give this a 7 and the Ipad a 10.if price IS considered in this rating, i give this a 10, and the ipad an 8.Somebody mentioned non-child appropriate content on the apps market, i checked, i did not see any "porn" per se, but there ARE plenty of sexy wallpapers and stuff. This may or may not be a concern for you.And then there are some stupid reviews, like the guy chiming in about how the processor, memory, ram, stuff like that are all not known, i disagree, they are clearly listed in every bit of literature, i think he must have been digging through thier grandfathers medicine cabinet again.I see several reviews that give 1-2 star reviews that seem very contradictory to what my experience was. This leads me to believe one of a few things, unrealistic expectations(40%), ignorance on how to use the device(20%), or possible QC issues at COBY(40%). lets be honest, when you think of "quality" is COBY the first brand that comes to mind? Keep your reciept and check the return policy, apparently cobys customer service sucks, make sure the store will take it back.That said, for [...] bucks this cant be beat, im floored at how well this works (for $[...]).If you are not willing to root, this is a great internet browser while yer on the couch, but you are missing out, i suggest either root this device or find one that doesent have an idiot in charge of what can and can not be done with it.Thanks and have a nice day!

My husband loves it I bought this as a Congratulations on graduating with a Bachelor/ grad school/ student teaching/ anniversary gift. We got it today in the mail and as soon as he received it he has not put it down (new toy). I don't think I could have found a better gift for him.

Samsung Tab The Samsung Galaxy tab is an affordable android device that has everything that you would want in a phone, and then some!If you purchase the unlocked version, you will be able to make phone calls and use the device like a giant Samsung Galaxy S.If you purchase any of the wireless brands, such as the T-Mobile device, you will have email, internet, text messaging, games, anything at all available on the Andriod Market, and pretty much everything you could ever want, except for the phone.The device is gorgeous and just the right size. Ideal for any user.I highly recommend this device over any of the currently released comparisons.

I Love My Viewpad! Perfect for me! Due to some of the reviews on this side I had reservations about buying this device. I needed an inexpensive all-in-one solution so when the proce dropped, I took a chance. I've had my Viewpad for a couple of weeks and I'm delighted.First of all, it's a hands free phone I bought as a replacement for my crappy pay-as-you-go T-Moble phone I bought a couple of years ago. I popped in the sim card from that phone to the vpad and made a call, no problems. The T-Mobile pay-per-use program is the least expensive option I've found for keeping an emergency cell phone with me. Problem was, I kept forgetting to charge to cell phone because I never use it. Well, I won't have a problem keeping the Vpad charged since it's so much more useful than a phone, both at home and when I'm out and about.I don't have 3G service, just edge. It's enough to grab an address from the Internet if I need directions. When at home, I have a wireless WAN for Internet access. The vpad jumped onto my home network without any problems. There is a setting to turn off data access for the phone so that I don't accidentally use my minutes for the Internet.If in the future I need better service or 3G access, AT&T; has some inexpensive pay-per-use options - $15 a month for data access on their Gophone 3G plan. They also have the "Buy $100 minutes, won't expire for a year" option as T-Moblie. I don't know if the unused portion rolls over like with T-Moble. The site doesn't say. But since I'm home most of the time, I can't see myself wasting the money. Most of the places I visit have free wi-fi, which is better anyway.For my car, I bought a  ToothPik Mobile Bluetooth Hands-free Car Kit that also plays music through my car speakers. The Vpad connected to the toothpick right away. For at home and when I'm shopping, I bought the Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset (both phone and music) the vpad connected without problems. I'll be looking for a bluetooth keyboard next. I'm hoping the case/keyboard combo for the Galaxy Tab will work. I've spent enough money this month, so I'm holding off.There's no Netflix app for this device, which is a Netflix issue not a vpad issue. I don't travel often and I have a 27" widescreen monitor for watching movies at home, which is much better than a 7" screen. Would be nice to have to entertain the kidlet when on the rare road trip. But he's taken over my ipod which does play Netflix via wi-fi. And he's happy with the screen size. Oh, to have young eyes again...I loaded videos to play on the vpad, which uses the same formatting as an ipod. Of course, I purchased an "optional" 32GB memory card, which really isn't an option. The user manual doesn't give instructions on how to do a data transfer from a computer. But the vpad comes with a USB cable to connect to a computer. When the device recognizes it is attached to a computer, it asks if you want to enable USB transfers then shows up as a device in My Computer. It's drag and drop from there (create your own folders). Just remember to close the connection before removing the device from the computer or you have to turn it off and back on again for the card to be recognized. Sometimes trial and error is the best way to learn.The device does not use Media Player or iTunes for sincing. For that, you are on your own. (USB connect, drag and drop)It is supposed to sinc to contacts in Outlook. I don't use Outlook, so I have no idea if that works. It did not work with Windows mail contacts so I had to type in my contact data. The T-Mobile crappy webservice-backup wiped out my contacts, way back when, and I never added the contacts back or I probably could have grabbed the data from the sim card.Documents to Go - one of the reasons why I purchased this device - allows me to view and EDIT MS Word files and has a decent pdf viewer made much easier due to the 7" screen. Docs to Go for Word does not read rtf or txt files (just doc) kind of a bummer but I can deal. I'm a touch typest so I won't be using the onscreen keyboard for writing novels. But I can edit one and write notes and ideas while away from the house. ;-) I haven't used the Excel or Powerpoint Docs to Go and probably won't.The onscreen keyboard is okay as on screen keyboards go. Due to the larger screen, I don't make as many typing mistakes as I did on my ipod and I can type much faster. I don't use the Swype feature.As an ebook reader - another reason why I wanted this device - it is decent. The Kindle app loaded without any problems. Eyestrain after a few hourse was a problem until I changed to a black background with white text, which seemed to help. I usually use my laptop for reading ebooks when at home. The vpad is for when I'm away, waiting for the kidlet for whatever reasons.The vpad connects to the official Goggle app store where there are plenty of free and paid apps. So far, I only have free apps like Angry Birds (almost a requirement for smart phones), Spider Solitare, social networking apps and more ebook readers.The touch screen is more sensitive than the reviews here led me to believe. My ipod doesn't feel nearly as sensitive. BTW, with the vpad sometimes you touch and hold to activate hidden submenues (a feature not discussed in the user manual). I have to be more careful when scrolling in the vpad than I do on the ipod or I activate a feature I hadn't intended. That's more of a technique problem than a problem with the device. The more I use it, the fewer problems I have.I'm still getting used to the four "buttons" (hot spots on the bezel) on the side of the device for "back" "Search" "main screen" and "Settings" that light up for a few seconds when touched then go dark. I'm getting used to the location and find I'm not fumbling for the right one as often. Sometimes I grab the device the wrong way and activate one of the buttons. Happens less often the more I use the device.I can create music playlists on the fly and delete duplicate files. The Media Player playlists I downloaded from my computer are recognized as lists on the vpad but do not play correctly. Don't know what is up with that. I have 8GB of music to organize. Sigh...The case that comes with the device is perfect for me. The flap covers the screen when in my daypack and flips into easel for tabletop use. I don't like that the power and headphone jacks are on the bottom of the device. Kind of annoying when the juice is low and I can't use the case the way it was designed.I use facebook. No problems there. The notifications (set up to make a sound) show up at the top of the device. I pull down the tab and see who said what. Tap and the app launches so that I can comment.The same notifications show received text messages. Hubby and I are sending little love notes, something we never did when I had the crappy old cell phone. If I had know buying a vpad would add a bit of romance to my life, I would have purchased it a long time ago.So far, the battery life is the same as a cell phone. The more I use it, the faster the battery drains. The more options I have running in the background, the faster the battery drains. In the settings, there's options to turn off the background items like wi-fi, bluetooth, (and airplane mode) to help save battery. I don't charge this device as often as I do my ipod, which was almost every day.There is so much more to this device, many options I have yet to play with like the voice to text, cameras (still and video), GPS navagation, video chat and whatever other apps there are to discover. I'll know more as summer progresses and we go on a vacation.When Smart Phones become intelligent enough to get a job to pay for their high monthly service fees, I might consider getting one. I "played" with an iPad one time, which was enough to know I wouldn't be happy with the size vs features vs price issues. I can't afford the other 7" tablets like The Tab, Zoom or Dell and I wanted an inexpensive cell phone replacement option, which the others do not provide. So even if the Vpad isn't perfect, for me, it is the perfect all-in-one solution.

excellent product It was exactly what I imagined and came very fast and so far I love it, it hurts to not have more memory, and I would love to know if you can put more as you would.

I Love Mine But After A Few Easy and Legal Mods First of all, I love this device! And just so you know, I was a software engineer in my previous career and now teach an engineering curriculum in high school, so believe me, when kids are wowed by your technology then you know it's good stuff. A few months ago I foolishly bought a Chinese knock-off Android tablet and I hated it; it was the classic case of "you get what you pay for." The Cruz T301 is definitely NOT a knock-off. The screen is gorgeous and extremely responsive, the Kindle app works just fine with all my eBooks, and there are plenty of the apps that I need in the Amazon store. Take note, I said "apps that I need." No, the Cruz does not have access to the Android Marketplace but let's be honest, there's a lot of junk apps in the full marketplace and I don't need 99.999% of them.For those that are either having troubles with their Cruz or are hesitant due to some of the negative reviews, I should tell you that the Cruz is not great out of the box. There are some things you need to do in order to get the maximum performance out of it. None of these things will void the warranty (like rooting it) or take a great deal of expertise.1. Read the complete user guide BEFORE opening the box. The manual included with the Cruz is laughable at best.2. UPGRADE TO ANDROID 2.2! I am shouting that one because it is the first thing you should do with it out of the box! (After giving it a full charge anyway) The upgrade is easy to do, takes about no more than 15 minutes, and there are simple step-by-step instructions on the manufacturer's web site. Believe me you will see a great deal of improvement in performance if you upgrade it. Plus upgrading it to 2.2 is just the right thing to do. No one should be running 2.0.3. Download and install the SkyFire web browser. The browser is not available in either the Cruz Market or the Amazon Marketplace (as far as I can tell) so what I had to do is find the install file online, download it to my laptop, copy it to the Cruz's SD card, and then install it from there. This browser has workarounds for lack of Adobe Flash support and loads full web pages (instead of mobile versions of web sites) at acceptable speeds.4. Spend the $9.95 to upgrade to OfficeSuite Pro. I've had pretty good experiences with not only browsing MS Office documents (both old format and 2007) but editing and even composing them as well.5. Install a screen shield/protector. Not only will it reduce (if not eliminate) scratches on the surface, it reduces the glare and improves the touch response, especially when dragging items. Actually every tablet owner should do this, it just makes sense. If you don't want to do it yourself, find a Zagg store at a nearby mall and have them install one.6. Repeat to yourself: THIS IS NOT AN IPAD! You paid less than half the price of an iPad and you're getting almost all of the capability. If you want an iPad, save more money, wait a while longer and buy one. It only has 256 MB of RAM so don't go crazy opening 20 apps at once. Some apps will stay in system memory even after you close them out, so use ASTRO (the Cruz's file manager) to kill any unwanted apps to free memory.Again, I'm a techie so I think I have a sense of what's good and what's not. For the past year I've been Jones-ing for either a Kindle, and iPad, or both. Now I don't want either one because my Cruz has made me extremely happy, once I did the steps I listed above. And I hope I've persuaded those of you on the fence to go ahead and buy the Cruz 301, I think it's a steal at for the $160-$200 price range.

Perfect Match, AMAZING Device!!! Battery Life:  Personally, this has to be on my top 2 priorities.  I own several toys/gadgets, great as some may be, once the battery goes out, I'm sorely disappointed.  Hate the several hours of wait time for them to charge back up.  So they either get very little use or go back in the original package and into the closet.  Now this Galaxy Tab I've been using heavily over the past 3 days, during last week's long X'mas holiday, and it still has about 10% charge left in it.  This said, it only took about 3.5 hours to re-charge and power it back up to 100%.  Excellent.Portability:  Perfect size, perfect screen size for yours truly.  I can finally and easily now see a lot of things as compared to my tiny smartphone screen.  Fits tightly in my jeans back pocket, but fits nicely in my cargo pants pockets.  I now carry it or have it nearby for use all over the house.  Also, a quality built, solid product in my humble opinion.Display:  Awesome, just beautiful, 1024X600 pixel res.  Turn on any of the live wallpaper screens and its better and/or comparable to my home LED and Plasma TV displays.Touchscreen:  Outstanding.  I'm a desktop, mouse-kinda-guy, but am now a touchscreen newbie convert.  Go ahead and try this touch pad Tab out at  BestBuy or any one of the phone carrier's stores.Internet:  Super fast WiFi surfing.  I'm benchmarking this in comparison to my HP 14 inch, 4 GB RAM, dual core, laptop.  Excellent on AT&T;'s basic speed, lightning fast on Cox cable and AT&T;'s higher U-verse setup.  Google search also works on voice command.  Haven't had a need to switch to an alternative browser such as Dolphin since the basic browser works just fine for my purposes.  Also haven't signed up for a data plan; still using WiFi for everything I've needed or wanted to do.Front Camera:  1.3 MB only; sweet for taking self-portraits and more using the front display screen.  Device is an eye catcher, conversation piece at the clubs & dive bars.  LoL.  You also can visit YouTube for the vids & how-to's using Fring, Qik, and Skype.  Great shame though that all the US carriers dissected the voice calling feature on this device.  I am not doing away with my smartphone, but AT&T; voice calling service on the GT would have been a nice extra, just in case.  Also, note that this AT&T; device has a removable/swappable SIM card port.Back Camera:  3.0 MB only; good indoor quality, better for sunlight/daytime pics.  Sample Galaxy Tab pics available at Yahoo's Flickr.  Biggie:  This is the only tablet out there with an autofocus camera that comes with a flash feature!Storage:  16 GB internal with up to 32 GB removable/swappable miroSD card; already installed an 8 GB microSD card in my Tab.  Prefer using the external card memory for all my stuff versus using the internal available limited storage.Bluetooth:  Super sweet!  Easily paired up with GF's and my laptop and our Nokia smartphones.  Have moved a bunch of my pics over, both from my smartphone and laptop.  More to move over.  The Gallery app is great.  Thing is, because of the Tab's hi-res screen display, any of the low-res pics I've taken clearly shows the image imperfections when zoomed out.  An analogy would be like watching a VHS tape on my 1080 LED screen, not a good quality output display.  I now just have to start taking digital pics with my other camera, set maybe at 5 GBs or more res.Android Apps:  Have checked these out some and yet have to find one I'd want to download in the GT.  100,000+ apps; who's got the time for this mega searching?.  Not into games, might load a Chess game, but that's about it.  Comes installed with 2 icon pages of AT&T;'s apps, i.e., Maps, Navigation works both touch type or voice command, music, video, MyFiles, Flash support, QikOffice, etc.  Also, found very usable loaded Widgets to place in my homescreen, i.e., one-touch for WiFi connection, Bluetooth, refresh, etc.  Signed up for a Gmail account, great app for sending out my txt messages and e-mails.Voice/Video Calls: I've downloaded both Fring and Skype on my Tab to make voice calls or video calls (I'm using WiFi for this). Both apps are loaded in the "Market" app of the Tab. Free calls to other signed up/members. Some charges apply to non Fring or Skype folks. Its all explained in their respective web sites.Media Hub:  Limited movies and not exactly cheap to purchase one.Lastly, AT&T; has excellent on-line GT tutorials & I've also downloaded the user's manual for just about all the important info I need to know.  Check out the GT's specs and all it has to offer.  If any or all of the above features appeal to your liking, BUY ONE! I highly recommend this product.  & you'll also help push to get the economy going!.  :^)  For the Naysayers out there:  There is no such thing, or ever will be, a "perfect" product.  Not even Einstein could find a Universal Theory.Excerpt from CNET's GT review (Oct 2010):  In fairness, what we enjoy most about the Galaxy Tab is that it's not trying to exactly copy the iPad's blueprint for success. Sure, Samsung's notepad, calendar, and photo apps look like pixel-for-pixel reproductions of the iPad's, but let's not overlook the fact that the Tab is half the size of the iPad. It's a different type of product that presents a different use case, one geared more for portability. That said, the Android smartphone market seems to cover a lot of this territory already. The Tab is also reaching out to all of the people who winced at the iPad's lack of Adobe Flash support, video camera, memory expansion, and drag-and-drop file support. If these are the features that have been holding you back from purchasing a tablet, then the Tab should be a perfect match.

Great Tablets! I've ordered a lot of Creative products in the past.  So, when I found the ZiiO tablet on Creative's website, I read more about it.  With the recent price drop, along with it's having Android 2.2 installed, I figured it was time to give it a try.  Also, my needs are limited, since I planned to use it at my office to work wirelessly.The ZiiO arrived quickly from Amazon in great shape.  It was a snap to get started, since it really only required that you charge it.  After that, it started and worked just fine.  I don't own an IPad or other tablets; so, I wasn't sure how this would perform as compared to my computers.  Overall, it's been great and perfect for my wireless work at the office.  The ZiiO's screen is sharp and very bright.  Using the touch screen is easy.  I prefer to use the stylus since my fingers will often hit more than one button or option.  But, it's really sensitive and responds very easily.  I ordered the screen protector, to avoid scratches; this went on easily and does not interfere with the screen's performance.As far as getting and using apps, it's been no problem.  I prefer to use the ZiiO Space website, which connects you with a free Android app site.  These download seamlessly.  Once downloaded, you install them and move the icon to the desktop screen, for easy access.  Then, you're good to go.  I've tried watching YouTube videos, and these look and sound really good.  The included Android browser is fast and sufficient for my purposes.  If you want a more comprehensive browser, you can get the app as mentioned above.  The sound from the small speakers on the bottom is clear and sharp, although more volume would be nice.  I haven't tried using headphones, but I expect that the sound quality and volume would be excellent, given my experience with other Creative MP3 players.Overall, I have to say that I'd definitely recommend this tablet for those looking to browse the internet, play games, or do basic tasks (especially using apps).  Even when going on standard websites, I've found them easy and relatively fast to navigate.  The keyboard pops up when you have to type or fill in a response on the webpage.  The 7" screen size is just right for me, being larger than a cell phone and small enough to hold comfortably in one hand.  It's too bad that the Creative ZiiO tablet does not get enough press in the US market.  However, given what you get for the lower price, I suspect that sales will go up quite sharply as word gets out.6/8/2012 Addendum:After having success with my ZiiO 7 tablet, I decided to order a ZiiO 10 for home.  And, like the other, this one has functioned very well and is definitely worth the extra money.  (Of note, it did take some minor adjustments when first setting up after taking it out of the box and charging it.  The touch screen adjustments were all off and had to be properly aligned through the settings menu.  After doing this, the tablet was up and running great.) The 10" screen makes playing games and surfing even easier than with the 7" tablet.  I primarily use this tablet at home, for those purposes (versus the 7" tablet which I use in the office).  Prior to purchasing the larger tablet, I had not tried the bluetooth features.  I really wanted to have a bluetooth speaker for when I'm on the computer in order to listen to my favorite internet radio stations.  So, when I was given the Big Blue Speaker (from Brookstone) for a gift, I quickly paired it with my ZiiO 10.  It's been great.  The pairing was quick and simple.  ZiiO connects easily every time.  And, the music streams perfectly; the X-Fi enhances the sound and is a nice feature with this tablet (since Creative is well known for their Sound Blaster equipment).  It's just another great feature that comes with the ZiiO tablets!

Nice Alternative to Apple I have owned this tablet for about half a year, and I would not trade it for an iPad. Love it!

Great tablet & Price! Good Hardware, much better if you "hack" it. I was concerned about purchasing this tablet due to all the negative reviews out there about the ROM/software and screen angle.  I purchased in June 2011, and found the ROM/ Android operating system to be acceptable after the first over the air update to version 3588.  I used it a week or two with that stock ROM and really didn't have any problems, so was hesitant to do any tweaking or hacking.  The tablet works with flash 10.1 to 10.3 contrary to many of the reviews.  There is a link to download it from Viewsonic's website ([...]).  As far as the screen, it is really a good screen, but it seems like it works better if you hold it upside down. Holding it normally, in landscape view, It needs to be viewed straight on, or from the top down. If you tilt the top away from you, it gets dimmer, and doesn't look good.  As long as you hold it flat to your view you are fine, but after a while the weight gets to you and you start tilting it away. At that point, just flip it over, and you can see it fine from the bottom view (tilted slightly away from your eye). Only problem with this is the switches are in a different position than normal, but I haven't had any real difficulty with that. So the screen is not really a big problem and it actually looks great from the right angles, or holding it upside down in landscape mode.Also during this initial 2 weeks time I was researching on the internet all the various options for 3rd party ROMs to use on the Viewsonic GTablet device.  There are many choices in ROMs for the GTablet, from Android 2.2, which it comes with, to 2.3 and 2.4, and also alpha or beta versions with Android Honeycomb 3.0.  Anyway, after a while using the default Viewsonic ROM the device stopped being able to find my music. It just quit showing up in the music player.  I tried other music players, and copying off and back on the music files, but still no luck.  Anyway, I finally got frustrated with this, and decided to take the leap and install a new ROM. It took me 3 attempts to get it to boot properly, having to use both nvflash (needs Windows USB drivers, which were a little difficult to get installed in Win7-64bit) and Clockworkmod. These are both developer tools for changing the ROM.  Anyway, there was a lot of information on the internet about the process, and many had tried and run into similar problems before, so a few quick google searches and I got the new ROM installed.  I went with a stable version of Andoid 2.3, along with some kernal tweaks that allow overclocking the processor. It really flies now, and works even better than before.  It also works with the Google android marketplace once hacked. Of course the Amazon Android marketplace is also very useful and I have made a few purchases there. ;-)Anyway, I am very happy to get a 10.1" high resolution Android tablet for $300 ($375 with nice carry case and extra 16GB SDHC card (again, from Amazon). It also has made my previous purchase of an internet radio, ipod touch, and Nook ereader not necessary, so those items will be going up on ebay soon. Who knows when I'm done, I may have my total net cost down to less than $200. That would really be awesome!!  So if you have a technical bent, and have possibly hacked or cracked devices before, are willing to keep trying until you get it done (ROM change), do not be afraid to purchase a GTablet. During June 2011, the Gtablets actually dropped to a low price of $249, but quickly turned around and are no longer available for much below $300. I think people are starting to realize it's a great deal on a great tablet.

Excellent - extremely portable and fun This much maligned netbook is a far better deal than the professional reviews would lead one to believe.Having worked with this little gem for a week now, I can say that I'm really impressed, though, of course, nothing is perfect.Out of the box this thing is a tad sluggish, but bear in mind that it's a netbook, not a full blown laptop. Though it has a dual core processor, its an Atom processor, not a Core2Duo or a CoreI. Don't let that frighten you off though. There's more than enough horsepower here to do the kinds of things one is likely to do with a machine like this.Let me start with the design. Personally, I love the flip screen. Being able to flip the screen and make this a tablet sort of device is fun and useful. It's heavy enough at 3+ lbs. You won't be holding it in your hands for long It works beautifully in the lap though.The touch screen is well implemented. In most apps, it's smooth and performs exactly as one would expect. I would say that performance is just a tick off of the performance of an iPad or similar device. I would love to completely avoid iPad comparisons, but at least for now it's pretty much inevitable.Of course the touch screen is HD which was one of the major selling points for me. Having lived with 1024 X 600 netbooks for some time, it's so refreshing to have this kind of resolution. Gone are the days of not being able to reach some buttons at the bottom of unsizable windows.The HD display is somewhat of a double sword though. Some may find that 1366 X 768 on a 10.1" display is below their limit for comfortable viewing. Things can be a bit small and those with weaker eyesight should consider this. Of course, there are many other available resolutions.As the resolution goes up, remember that the apparent size of things on screen will go down. This means that, at times, using the touch screen can be a bit tricky. You will need to point very precisely with a finger - a very imprecise tool - in order to do some things. But of course, when needs be, one can always switch back to regular netbook mode and use the excellent touchpad.Speaking of the touchpad, it's easily the finest I've ever seen on a netbook. In fact, it's far superior to the toughpads on most full sized laptops. It's plenty big enough and quite smooth. Two finger scrolling is well implemented and aside from the occasion over run, it works great. Though it's supposed to be able to support most common gestures, I don't find that they work that well, if at all. I've never been able to get 'pinch to zoom' to work from the touchpad at all though the docs suggest that it should. This hasn't bothered me because these gestures work so well on the touch screen.In addition to an excellent touchpad, the Duo has a nice keyboard. As a touch typist who has worked with real keyboards for decades, the modern 'chiclet' standard keys have been a bit difficult for me to get used to, but I have to admit that it works. There is significant space between each key and this serves to keep my typing pretty accurate. All of the keys one would expect are present though page up/down and home and end require the use of the Fn key + an arrow. I would have liked to have seen these keys shoehorned in somewhere. Then again, this is a netbook. Backliighting the keyboard would have been a nice touch as well, but I'm sure cost and power considerations wouldn't allow it.My biggest gripe with the Duo is the included ports - or should I say almost complete lack thereof. We have two USB ports and a headphone port. That would be it. I will concede that for the vast majority of users, this is probably fine but many of us would find a few more things like ethernet and vga to be very useful and I suspect most will miss an SD card slot. Ethernet, audio in and out and more usb ports can be added with the Duo Audio Station, but even that lacks any sort of video out. This this thing is so good at multimedia that it really would have been nice to have an HDMI or mini-HDMI but it is what it is. This does serve to keep the machine sleek and svelt, it just limits options.So how does this monster perform. Well, for a netbook, surprisingly well. No this isn't going to replace your desktop. You won't be playing modern 3D accelerated games on this. But would you really have any expectations that you would? Would you really want to play WOW on a 10.1" screen?Out of the box, performance is fine for the most common things most users will do with the duo. Web surfing, email and multimedia all shine. Watching HD movies (even streamed) is a joy. Office applications chew up your work with plenty of performance to spare. You just have to accept that with an Atom processor and 2GB of ram - you're not going to have 20 things open at once without a serious performance hit and that applications are going to launch a bit slower. In practice, I find all of these types of things work just about as well as they do on my primary laptop - a Core i5 machine with much higher specs.One feature that may bother some is the weak battery life. Reportedly, users get about 3 hours on a full charge. This, of course, depends on the nature of the work you do with it and how you have the power settings configured but don't expect this thing to get you through a coast to coast flight. As is becoming more an more ubiquitous, the batteries (there are actually 2 dual cell batteries as opposed to 1 4 cell) are not user replaceable so the charge you have is what you get. This may be a major sticking point for some, but I don't find myself without access to A/C all that much and I really haven't minded.Dell has added a 'touch' layer of applications over top of windows called 'Dell Stage'. As has been covered in every review I've seen, their implementation is OK, but not great. This stuff turns on automatically when flipped into tablet mode. It gives you icons for several applications that your are likely to want to use in that mode. Video, music, games, drawing, etc. Some are better than others. Some are frankly a sham. The games icon simply opens the MS Games folder and lets you play the same version of solitaire and freecell that you've been playing for years.The stage software can be closed and even disabled though so I don't find it to be much of a hassle. I tend to use other applications for these things anyway so I frankly just don't care much about this stuff.One thing that is a bit of an annoyance is the on screen keyboard. When in tablet mode, obviously, you have to use some touch screen method for inputing text when needed - URLs for instance. When you click in the search box of a browser you (often) get an icon that lets you open the on screen keyboard. I include that 'often' because it doesn't always happen and you have to find the keyboard button on the side of the screen. Not that big of a deal, but I would like to see this work a bit more consistently.Once the keyboard is open, the user is presented with a full keyboard that works ok. It's not great and pawls is comparison to the on screen keyboard of the iPad. This is for no more than entering short pieces of text - like urls. Don't plan on penning your novel in this fashion. it will become a frustrating effort quickly.Finally, I'd like to add that this has all been written with the Duo 'out of the box' in mind. I've taken the plunge and made a significant upgrade that made this very good netbook an excellent netbook. From Dell, the Duo comes with a 320 GB 7200 RPM hard drive. This works fine but technology is moving forward.I replaced the original drive with a 120 GB Intel SSD. This is not an upgrade for a casual user nor is it cheap. The drive is difficult to get to and you have to either reconstruct the new drive or clone it from the original. None of this is 'that' hard, but I would advise less experienced users that consider this to find a pro to offer some assistance.The performance upgrade is remarkable. Boot time dropped to half of what it started at and applications now launch blindingly fast. This is still a netbook so don't expect miracles, but the difference is amazing. I'm actually quite surprised that Dell doesn't offer an SSD as a factory upgrade, but I suppose the cost involved might scare some off.Not to get too technical, but....One of the reasons the SSD works so well to increase overall performance is the paltry 2 GB of native ram. Given this, Windows must rely heavily on a swap file on the drive. Even at 7200 RPM constant reads and writes will slow things down at times. SSDs read and write at such high speeds that swap file access is now nearly as fast as reads and writes to the ram. This is the theory behind the recent Macbook Airs and the reason that such poorly spec'd machines can perform so well. Essentially, I guess this creates an Inspiron Mini Duo Air.You also have to consider storage needs. Dropping from 320GB to 120 will obviously limit some of the things you can do. If you want to store dozens of movies locally or a huge music library, you're not going to do it with 120GB. Larger SSDs are available, but a 240GB will probably cost you more than the Duo in the first place. Besides, the original drive (no longer needed) can be inserted in a USB enclosure and used for external storage. This would actually increase your available storage.There is another significant advantage to adding an SSD. With no spinning disks (or any other moving parts of any kind) the SSD uses far less power than a 7200 RPM drive - hence better battery life. I seem to be able to get about 4 hours out of my Duo now where stock devices come in at about 3.I can't speak highly enough about how much the SSD has improved the Duo, but remember that performance is just fine with the stock drive.In conclusion, it should be pretty clear by now that I really like this thing. I develop software professionally and have even written a few things on the Duo. There's plenty of power here to accomplish a lot of real work and more than enough for basic netbook stuff. The addition of the SSD has really woken this thing up even though it wasn't bad to start with.The form factor is attractive and fun. Watching the looks on people faces when they see me rotate the screen is priceless.I can't wait till technology rolls on a bit further and we can get serious processors and much more ram in a machine this size. I can tell you know that when the Inspiron Mini Duo II hits the market I will probably buy it sight unseen based on how happy I am with this.Having a full Windows 7 machined crammed into a tablet is probably more useful than you'd guess. I own an iPad and use it all the time. With that being said, there are things an iPad can't and never will be able to do. I keep both of these in the same case and carry them with me everywhere. They're a fantastic combo.

Ram limit 2G After an hour of research, I confirm that the Ram can't be upgraded to 4G.It is limited by the N550 CPU architecture.Still I bought one for a black friday price. I believe if used carefully, it will 2G ram is still enough.

You see... I have this silly smile I can not get rid of.... My smile has faded away, read on. I ordered this tablet, my first Android device, and I was kinda wondering what I would receive...So far I'm really pleased with this thing!Being a Palm and iPod Touch user and early adopter of what people call "smart phones", I wasn't sure if I wanted a large-format device.  I have friends who are pushing their Apple tablets at me and I'm an iMac user myself... but I just wasn't sure if I needed (read that as wanted) a tablet.I bought this on "speculation" to see if I could have a little fun and perhaps learn something new.I'm having the fun part right away and I can see that some learnin' is headed my way here with the Android operating system this tablet uses.  Not hard learning, but with the "open-ness" of Android I expect to be finding new stuff to do for a good while.Out of the box I received a durable-feeling device with a nice large screen.  It turned-on first try and responded to the battery charger just like the (little) owner's manual predicted.  There is a great deal more going on with this thing than the little booklet speaks of, but the manual is complete enough for anyone to realize all but the nuts and bolts of Android... I believe the manual was not intended to tech Android to a user but to simply expose the buyer to the capabilities of the tablet.  The manual is a translation, but a good one with pictures and diagrams. Easy to read and understand.I haven't done much with it yet, but I have connected to the net using my WPA-2 WiFi "Apple Airport Extreme" and had no problem with the setup.  It reminded me of getting a Nintendo DSi connected... it was that easy. I am using MAC address filtering and that posed no problem after putting the tablet's MAC address in my list.The Localization settings were easy with the only "snag" as yet being the temperature display in the Home screen is in Centigrade and I can't (as yet) figure out how to switch to Fahrenheit.  It even "found" my little home town to use as the target city :)The only other thing I haven't figured yet is if the operating system is consuming part of the 2 gig of memory, leaving only 1 gig free or if the device shipped with only 1 gig of memory.I think this problem is my lack of familiarity with Android :)I will attempt to provide a better review as time allows, but for now I'm happy.One final note, the device is called a "MID" in the Owner's Manual and the following information appears in the "About Device" screen on the device it's self;Model Number: debFirmwear Version: 2.1-update1Kernel Version: 2.6.32.9 hzhao@emma #1Build Number: deb-r2.1.1170There is another tablet listed on Amazon called a "MID" but it does not seem to have a camera or a GPS receiver.  This unit's GPS "antenna" is external and I think the little hocky-puck is both an antenna and receiver combined.Update: (12/26/2010)Liking the tablet! The hardware is working great, no problems at all, no glitches or silly business from the device or the Android "build" as is installed.The only things I'm watching are;- The "Home" button on the front is not indexed exactly right under the front cover. Not a problem but there was a moment where it was trying to get stuck.- One of the tiny little "plugs" covering the cabinet screws has fallen out. This is no problem at all as there will come a day when I want to take those screws out myself and those plugs are going away on that day. As a side note, this tablet survived a drop from my desk top to the plastic carpet protector under the desk without a glitch.- The Android "build" has a little trouble when rotating the screen.  Two issues so far 1.) When you use Google's Star application, the Horizon is oriented incorrectly and does not correct even when you try the adjustments for screen rotation in Android or in Google's application. Weirdly, the names of planets and stars continue to rotate (to the wrong angle) even if you turn-off all the rotation controls. 2.) When you use the device in the "Landscape" orientation there is a very useful "Back" button in the screen in the top right... when you rotate to "Portrait" orientation that button goes away and you have to use the hardware buttons. Not really a big deal but the behavior of the on-screen "Back" button and the hardware button are not exactly the same in all applications.- About keyboards, mice, and memory devices. USB supports all these but does not recognize anything else.  I am using a Bluetooth "dongle" and my Apple "Magic Mouse" but my HID Bluetooth keyboard and Bluetooth GPS are not recognized.  So far I have not found an application that can pair any Bluetooth devices that are not physically incorporated in the device (that's none so far). The Bluetooth dongle I have states it is a wired equivalent of a mouse and keyboard.. but that HID keyboard is not working.That's all for now. It's worth the $230 to me so far but I'm new at this so I might not have the expectations a more seasoned Android user might have.Update: (1/7/2011)The people I got my tablet from are fantastic!  I used email to talk to them about getting a registration number for the Android release on my tablet and they were really warm and responsive.  It was like they actually liked the product!I no longer see them listed as sellers but I will look for them the next time I want something from China.(Beijing Ning Rong Technology Development Co. Ltd)I Learned some stuff.- There are a lot of "Widgets" and "Gadgets" that fail when used on a tablet... perhaps it's just this one, but I suspect the large screen is giving them trouble.- You can use an Apple Magic Mouse and Apple Wireless Keyboard (Retail Packaging) by first pairing them on your desktop machine and then moving the Bluetooth "dongle" to the Flytouch. I use an IOGear USB 2.1 Bluetooth Micro Adapter GBU421- The "Escape" key on the keyboard functions like the "Back" button on the screen.- F4 seems to first, put the device into "sleep" then shortly it will re-boot.- F1 acts like the "Menu" button.Still have not found any applications that provide USB support for other than keyboard, mouse, and memory. I hope the developers of Android see the tablet as a "future" for Android and start providing full support for USB attached peripherals.The display is really nice indoors. Outdoors it's washed-out but usable.Price jump. What's this about?!?I'm a little disturbed that this tablet has jumped in price. I kinda was thinking about a second one for a friend but at this rate, she's probably going to get something else.  Too bad, we like this one. :)Update: (01/19/2011) - Sorry if this is turning into a "blog"...An update to the Android OS has come out, not a big change like version 2.2 or anything, but it allowed me to see what and how upgrades look like and are done.It did not go so well.  I had to go onto the Internet and find the proper file myself and load it again using a micro SD card. After that everything was back to "normal".  I had to find and re-load all the applications I had loaded and every setting had to be re-entered.  I later found out that you can back-up these things and save yourself some time.  Considering the changes to the Android OS, I will wait for a major update before going with another minor one again... too much hassle for not so much gain.The tablet is still a winner! I have it running for several hours a day and am even now watching a DVD TV show (converted using "Handbrake" for the Mac). Playback is smooth at 720 x 400 and around 1100 bits per second (m-peg4). See, this thing is making me learn about stuff like Android OS and video data rates :)Still can't set the Weather widget to Fahrenheit, but otherwise I'm still happy with the purchase.Update: (06/01/2014) - Amazon still lists this tablet on their site.Beware of the following issues;1.) This tablet is no longer supported by the manufacturer. NO UPDATES TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM.2.) The Amazon Appstore no longer functions correctly on this device. NO MORE APPS CAN BE INSTALLED.3.) You are lucky if you installed a suite of useful applications because Amazon Appstore and Google Play are unavailable to you with this device. You can "side load" the old Android Market but it is severely "broken" and will likely not even allow you to browse applications.Good while it lasted! This tablet was my first Android device and it still functions as it did when it was new. A good device left to fallow by an supportive vendor. Beware that if something you buy lasts beyond the 30 or 90 day warrentee period you are likely to be "on your own" from there on out.

Tablet + Laptop + Wacom = :-) Asus EEE Slate EP121 64 GB ReviewedFor some background, I am very comfortable working with computers and decided to buy this over a tablet, such as a Kindel or a Transformer because I wanted to be able to use MS Office, Zune Pass, read books, and draw. While it is expensive it is all of then functions really well, rather than only a few. In that regard, I only had to purchase one device instead of at least 3 purchases (tablet, laptop, and Wacom pen).On purchasing it, I also installed Zune, Office Professional, Amazon Kindle for PC, Comical (a comic book reader), and Skype. I also updated all the software and drivers (including manually updating the Wacom pen drivers from Asus.com). I even setup the Bluetooth keyboard with is trouble. Finally I made all my customizations-hid all desktop icons, turned on clock gadget, weather gadget, installed live calendar gadget, synced windows live account, and picked out a theme from the online gallery. Seems like a lot of work, but it is worth it to me.As to the specs:Os (Windows 7 Home Premium): One great feature is having a real operating system. Long before there was an App that, there were a lot of programs available some so nice you would shell out a lot of cash for Well they are all available. The big ones for me on this are Office and Photoshop.. Though I have to wait on the latter. Additionally, I can home network with my desktop which runs Windows7. Then there are a couple of great surprises. The pen can enter handwriting and convert it to text everything here was entered that way. It is also useful in OneNote because I can write and draw pictures like I'm in a real notebook. There is also pretty fantastic Speech Recognition, that will dictate a letter or open a program.Screen Resolution: I have read many people's complaints about how resolution on this monitor. I can only disagree. I believe this must be based on the current trend of ultra high resolution cell phones. I would like to explain just a few things. First a WXGA (1280800) LCD monitor is considered HD. Second, the complaint is based on the pixel density, or the number of pixels available per square inch. The density on a normal monitor is ~100 PPI. The density on this monitor is 124.75 PPI. An Ipad2 is 1024x768 (9.7") or 132 PPI. If you have never complained about these monitors and are not interested in paying 2 or 3 thousand dollars for the device, you will not complain about this feature.Process and memory: It has a Intel Dual-Core i5 470um with 4GB DDR3, 1 x SO-DIMM. It is a 64 bit processor. It is fast enough that I really don't see any delays. The one possible complaint is turning the screen switches its orientation and it goes black for one second instead of harm an animation.Storage: It has a 64 GB BSD. This antiquates to the speed, but it is also not a lot of memory. After all my installs I have used up around 35GB. I did give myself an extra 32GB by using the SD card set with a memory card from an old phone. Abs, MS gives you 25GB online storage and 5GB synced stage at skydrive.live.com. If that isn't enough Asus has more available with l year free trial of online storage at their website (50OGB). So while it is more than my old 8063 laptop, it is shallow on space compared to others without extras.Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth works as expected. No cellular service, but I was not looking.Camera and Audio: I have had issue with some Asus webcams before , but none here. Crisp without delay. The audio is stereo and fine for a laptop.Battery: Listed as 4.5 hrs. With more demanding settings, I get around 3-4 hrs of normal use. It charges without any trouble-even in use.Extras: It comes. With several useful ports (2 x USB 2.0 port, Audio Jack, mini HDMI port, and MMC/ SD(SDHC/SDXC) Card Reader). In short, you can plug a couple USB devices in, hook it up to you TV, and either expand the available memory or look at photos from a camera. If that's not enough, it comes with a Bluetooth keyboard, a pressure sensitive pen, and a case - that let you work like a pen and paper, improves navigation, and lets you pretend you are on a regular laptop, but you are on something better. I bought a Bluetooth mouse, thinking it would make navigation easier, but I never use it.Summary: This is not a typical tablet-it is a real computer. It can perform as well as a laptop, has nice drawing features, and is very portable. I love it. When factoring in all my desires, it is a good deal. I had good surprises only. The biggest downside to me is the limited stage, but it is manageable. The battery life is shorter than a tablet, but this is a slate computer, and it is acceptable. The pen works fantastically. Beware your friends will all be jealous.If you decide to purchase one, do yourself a favor-go to Asus.com and find the updated pen drivers here[...]They are listed as "Wacon ISD_DualTouch_V7.0.2-21" at this time. If you don't you could, have a problem with the screen not responding after significant use...So far I am perfectly happy in spite of the small storage capacity.UPDATE: I updated to Windows 8 Pro essentially when the update was available back in October or November. I had one issue early on with an update not making it through and another almost immediately with the side buttons. The first was resolved by Microsoft early on. The second was resolved by updating the drivers/software. All of that is available on Asus's website.I am very pleased with the update. The update definitely improves the speed of the computer, especially with boot and wake up times. New interface with the start menu is more convenient and less clutsy for touch than the Windows 7 interface. I liked it so much I updated my desktop (which doesn't have touch). Would highly recommend Windows 8 Pro for any people with this device still holding onto Windows 7.

For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia *UPDATE 8* Now Up:  See the addendum at the end of this review.I pre-ordered the 32gb Thrive here on Amazon, but got impatient and went to a local retailer just to check them out. We loved this tab so much, we got a 2nd for my husband in 16gb.Toshiba BrandFirst off -- No -- I do not work for Toshiba. But I fell in love with the brand a little over a year ago when I bought a new Qosmio laptop, and it's BY FAR the best computer I have ever owned.  I love it as much today as the day I got it, so when I found out Toshiba had an Android Tab, I had to take a serious look.Galaxy & Iconia in BriefPrior to learning about Thrive, I was seriously considering the new 10" Galaxy Tab.  I had been coveting the 8" model for some time, but just wasn't ready to take the leap.  So when the 10" came along, I just had to stop by a local retailer to try one out hands-on.  And I must say, I really fell in love with it -- the screen is vivid and stunning, the interface is clean and responsive.  And it's super thin for sure.  But, the first thing I noticed was there's no inputs of any kind; no SD slot, no USB, no nada.  The sales rep said that's because everything is trending toward the "cloud."  Well, that's all well and good, but I like products that I control, not products that control me (hence why I'm no fan of Apple's line of iShackle products.  I'm all for "the cloud" and have one here on Amazon for my music, but I'm also the type that prefers to have my own stuff stored locally.  I also like to get into the nuts and bolts of my peripherals and use them my way, so having no inputs on the Galaxy was a huge letdown for me.  I left the store feeling underwhelmed, and like it wasn't the right time to buy a tablet.  But I was bitten by the bug so I went home and started researching other tabs.Reviews here on Amazon had me convinced Acer Iconia was better than Asus Transformer.  And the Acer had USB inputs, so I was happy with that.  But I've never been a big fan of Acer, so I still wasn't feeling the itch just yet.  But then I stumbled upon the Toshiba Thrive, and still being so highly impressed with their laptop, I immediately felt a connection to the Thrive.Every Input I'll Ever NeedThrive has SD card, USB, mini-USB and full size HDMI ports.  And for me, this is where Thrive clobbers the competition -- Toshiba just "gets it;" they make products that keep the end user in control and offer a truly freeing experience.  I have a full size HDMI port on my Toshiba laptop too, and let me tell you, it completely changed my computing experience!  My laptop is connected to a 50" plasma TV and I use a wireless keyboard and gyration remote for a mouse.  Let me tell you, once you use a computer that way, there's just no going back.  So all those inputs on the Thrive was a big clincher for me -- and once again, Toshiba stands head and shoulders above the rest in this department.  I fully expect to connect my tablet to my HDTV as well.  And the on-board SD and USB ports assure I'll have all the computing freedom and control I've come to expect.Vibrant Screen and ColorWhen I first saw the Thrive at my local electronics store, I was a bit concerned the screen wasn't as vibrant as the Galaxy.  But then I remembered Thrive has an auto brightness feature, so I was wondering if that was limiting the saturation in some way.  I was easily able to find and navigate the setup menus right there in the store, turned off auto-brightness -- and voila! -- the Thrive's screen was every bit as vibrant and rich as the Galaxy!  The colors and clarity are nothing short of stunning.  I hate to say it, but the screen is probably better than my 50" plasma (it's only a couple years old, which already makes it a relic in tech world.)Ease of UseFor me, the truest test of any piece of tech, is the ability to use it straight out of the box with NO help from user manuals.  I got a new printer recently and had to fiddle with it for days because the install didn't set it up properly -- and in my book -- that's a sure sign of a piece of junk.  This Thrive, however, was very simple and easy to get the hang of within minutes right there in the store.  Naturally, that's as much a testament to Android 3.1 as it is to Toshiba Thrive.  Either way, I was doing everything from surfing the net, to customizing the entire interface and settings in minutes, all right there in the store -- no user manuals, no nothing.  I even tethered it to my cell phone just for fun.  The interface is so smooth and responsive, and the Tegra CPU is clearly a beast; no hangs, locking or delays of any kind.  Everything was fast, smooth and clean; just the way it should be.  In fact, Thrive loaded and buffered YouTube videos better than the Galaxy, though there could be many reasons for that given all the devices on the store's WiFi network.Rubberized BackSome might not think much of this, but believe me, it's pretty awesome and makes the Thrive feel like velvet in my hands!  It also gives me confidence in the tablet's durability and build quality.  By contrast, both the Galaxy and Iconia have a hard, slick back, and as a result, I personally found them both harder to hang on to.  I'm disabled and easily drop things, so I never felt fully confident holding either the Galaxy or Iconia.  All of these tabs are just a few weeks old, and it's worth pointing out that the backs of both the Galaxy and Iconia were scuffed and scratched to the point of making them look junky.  Granted, they're both display models in a high traffic store, but the physical condition of both these tabs after only a couple weeks on display suggests one can expect the same blemishes from personal use over time.  By contrast, the Thrive's rubber backing assures there'll be no scuffs or scratches on my tab or anything I set it down on.  And if it does wear out, I can just buy a new backing in one of 6 cool colors.ThicknessYes, the Thrive is probably twice as thick as the Galaxy, but I'm ok with that.  Especially since it isn't all that much heavier.  I think the added thickness is due to the USB and HDMI inputs the Galaxy is lacking.  Personally, I'd rather have a slightly thicker tab with all the inputs I want, than a wafer thin tab that has a USB dongle dangling from it that I always have to remember to carry.  Smaller and thinner isn't always better, at least not for my taste.  I don't want a 10" wafer thin screen that I'm scared to drop or set down anywhere, or that will easily get scratched or cracked.  The Galaxy just doesn't feel very durable, nor did the Iconia.  While the added thickness and rubberized back make the Thrive feel more durable; like it could survive being accidentally dropped, or if placed on a table, the rubber backing would help it survive minor spills.  Being disabled, I need something durable, and to that end, the Thrive feels like it will easily outlast both the Galaxy and Iconia.  And we're not talking a super thick tablet here; it's still plenty thin.  It's also very light; if not, my hands would cramp up and I wouldn't be able to grasp it to begin with.Wider Body - More To Get My Paws On!The Thrive is a bit wider than both the Galaxy and the Iconia -- the screen size is the same on all 3, but the Thrive's casing is about half an inch wider, which is great because it gives me a little more edge to hang on to without my fingers covering part of the screen.  I have big hands, so this all adds up to a good thing for me.  Overall, the Thrive just feels better in my hands, and more sturdy and durable.Screen ProtectorsI'm a fan of those "helicopter blade" screen protectors and have been using them on all my touch screen devices for years.  I went ahead and ordered a full body protector for my 32gb Thrive pre-order.  But after getting my hands on my husband's 16gb Thrive, I'm realizing I don't want to cover the velvety rubber back of my Thrive with a screen protector.  They haven't arrived yet, but I'm hoping we can use the back of the screen protector on the front of our 16gb Thrive (both pieces appear to be the same shape and size.  If not, no biggie, we'll just order another screen protector.  I'm a big believer in screen protection and they've saved me from accidental scratches more than once.Entertainment HubI've read that Tablets are trying to edge themselves into being the conduit that connects all your devices -- TV, cell phone, computer, etc.  And after getting this Thrive in my hands, I can see how tablets can easily fill that void.  I love my Qosmio laptop, but prefer not to take it away from home.  And my smartphone is great, but the screen is just too small to enjoy surfing the net on it.  But now with the Thrive, I can stay connected and still enjoy a full-fledged experience on the go, or even at home, all in the palm of my hands.  I've never been much into social networking, but I'm realizing that for someone with limited mobility, this might be my conduit to the outside world.  I can totally see how using this tab in a social aspect while watching TV would broaden and enhance my experience.  I just may get into Twitter too, and all that thanks to this Thrive!  Duh -- I'm starting to get why they named it that to begin with!Replaceable BatterySome people might find this meaningless.  But I just had to replace the battery in my expensive Harmony remote and it's only 2 years old.  So for me, having a replaceable battery in an expensive tablet its HUGE!  No other brand offers this but Thrive.Bottom Line -- my head is reeling a bit from the thought of owning 2 tablets.  It's really not an expense we can afford and I should probably cancel my 32gb pre-order here at Amazon or return this 16gb.  But we love it so much...  I guess we'll see what happens.  Either way, I really love this tablet and am VERY happy with it.  Every once in a while, a product comes along that fits my life like a glove.  Last time, it was Toshiba's Qosmio laptop.  This time, it's their Thrive tablet.  These are the first 2 Toshiba products I've owned, and I must say, I think Toshiba has won me over for life.  The quality, ease of use, superior construction and forward thinking innovation -- I'm sold; hands down.  There are plenty of tablets out there to choose from.  Just do your research and find the one that fits you.  For me, that's Toshiba Thrive.  I LOVE this tablet!!7/22/11 UPDATE -- Tips & Tricks:After using both 16gb and 32gb Thrive's for a couple weeks, I thought I'd add this addendum to my review:HDMI DUAL VIEWHook up the Thrive to your HDTV and the screen will display simultaneously on Thrive and your TV; Angry Birds on a 50" plasma - FUN!  I got a 25' HDMI cable, but am looking into wireless.  Picture is stunning.  BTW -- there's a reason why HDTVs _don't_ use mini or micro HDMI -- because the signal isn't as good as full-size HDMI, and only Thrive has that capability.DON'T USE A USB HUBI've had spotty results transferring files to Thrive when plugged into a hub.  But when I plug the Thrive directly into my laptop's USB port, I've had no issues and transfers are quite fast. (Win 7 Pro 64bit)FIREWALLS CAN BLOCK APPSI was initially having problems downloading apps from the Market while on my home WiFi, but then I realized my router's firewall was blocking some of Thrive's inbound traffic. So I set up 2 simple Port Forwarding rules, and voila, problem solved.BATTERY LIFEThrive charges in a about 1 hour; slightly longer if you're using it while charging.  So far, I've been getting 14-26 hours per charge while using Thrive on and off throughout the day.  My screen is set to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned off.  I leave WiFi on and just let Thrive go into sleep mode when not in use; naturally, the battery lasts even longer if I completely shut down at night.  Yesterday, I started the day with 50% battery life left -- I played Angry Birds for 4 hrs straight, watched YouTube for an hour, surfed the net and checked email for another hour, and read a book for 90min -- all that before the battery finally died and needed a recharge.  There's nothing scientific about my tally, but Thrive is giving me great battery life, IMO.ADOBE FLASH, FAST SURFING & PAGE LOADSSurfing the net is NOTHING like on my phone.  Web pages load as fast as my laptop and I can have several tabs open at the same time.  Fast, smooth and responsive.  Flash works great.  Haven't run into a website yet that doesn't work.EXTERNAL USB & FLASH DRIVESMake sure they are formatted with FAT (not NTFS) and you'll have no problems.  I even hooked up an external 500gb Western Digital My Passport drive with no issues.WHY 32gb IS BETTER THAN 16 or 8gbThrive comes pre-loaded with many apps; some useful, like Toshiba File Manager and Service Station; some not so useful, and they can't be deleted.  Point being -- I've never heard anyone complain about having too much HD space.  So do yourself a favor and get the largest GB you can afford.  SD cards, IMO, are for convenience, NOT for extending your storage capacity and running apps off it.  I use mine to view and transfer pics off my digital camera.FUN & HELPFUL APPS>Advanced WiFi Lock Free -- this solves the dreaded wake from sleep issue.  Go into the app's settings and UN-check "Enable Timeout."  Prior to this, I experienced the issue twice, but since installing this app, the wake from sleep issue has disappeared.  I do sometimes have to push the power button twice to get it to wake from sleep.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints about how the buttons work.>Talking Panda Free -- fun for kids of all ages!>Amazon Kindle -- read your digital books on Thrive.  Just wish it had text-to-speech.>DirecTV -- program your DVR(s) on the go and never miss a fave TV program.>Angry Birds -- I never thought I'd get into this game, but it really is fun.  Rio is my favorite edition.>Paint Joy -- finger painting on your tablet.  Save, share and even watch a time-lapsed rendition of your creations; kinda fun!  Let loose your inner artist!THRIVE PORTFOLIO CASEI got this case for outings away from home.  But at home, I prefer using Thrive without the case.  The Thrive is thicker than Galaxy, but I probably would have left Galaxy in it's case, because I didn't like how slick it felt.  So Thrive without a case is about the same thickness as with Galaxy with a case.ENTERTAINMENT CENTERThrive has already become another component of my home entertainment system.  I use it simultaneously while watching TV or even surfing the net on my laptop, which is hooked up to my 50" plasma.  The Thrive has become an addition and a natural extension of my home entertainment center.That's it for now; I'll add more in time, if I think of anything.9/5/2011 UPDATE 2 - over 2 months and still loving my Thrive.  Here's a couple extra helpful tips:HDTV VIA THRIVEWe took our Thrive on vacation with us for our anniversary (happy 21st to us!) and hooked it up to the hotel's 42" HDTV.  Thanks to Thrive's full-sized HDMI port, we easily ran a 25' cable right to our bed and watched our fave TV shows right off the TV network's websites while connected to the hotel's free WiFi.THRIVE DOCKDo yourself a favor and get one if the expense fits your budget. It's a tad overpriced at $50 with no power supply (it uses the one that came with Thrive) but it doubles as a great lap stand and makes charging the Thrive much more convenient; just slip it in and out of the cradle.  Don't like how the adapter fits into the Thrive itself and the dock solves that problem.  Also, Thrive looks great on display in the dock too.  I suppose if you don't mind changing the screen timeout a lot, you could even use it as a digital picture frame (just be careful with that if running off the battery.  I have a review for the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI too if you're interested.PORT FORWARDINGI was going to post specifics in my last update, but thought it might be different for everyone and didn't want to misinform.  But in case it helps anyone, here's how I fixed the problem I had with downloading apps from the Market on my home WiFi:I have my router's firewall set to high, and when I played around with the different security levels, I noticed the 2 that were blocking my Thrive were Real A/V port 7070 and T120 port 1503. I set 2 specific rules and opened those ports for my Thrive, and then the Market apps downloaded without issue. (these were both inbound traffic.  You have to know a little about port forwarding for this to make sense, but it's not that hard to do; a quick Google search never hurts. :-)MORE GREAT APPS> Scrabble is interesting because you can play online over time. I have 30 games going any given week. The app is a bit buggy, but it's still fun and I'm sure they'll improve on it.> Documents To Go is half off @ $7.99 in the Amazon AppStore> Twitter - works well but I'm still learning and don't tweet much, mostly follow.> Gmail comes standard with the tab. GDocs and all of Google's stuff is awesome.> GOOGLE SKY helped us find Jupiter, Mars, all the planets and stars in our solar system last night!! CQQL!!> The Kroger app lets me add digital coupons to my grocery store club card.> DirecTV Remote controls my TV's DVR; kinda neat.> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has a neat widget where you can flick up or down to change the temperature amongst your saved locations> Cloudy is a fun paper airplane game> PhotoShop Express is free and always good to have.> MXvideo Player has neat swipe controls that make it easy to forward, pause and reverse vids while they are playing.> the Bookmarks widget that comes standard with the tab lets you scroll through thumbnails of each web page.> Vevo and TV.com apps have some good content> Fruit Ninja is surprisingly fun; I like Zen Mode.  It speaks to my inner samurai.> and don't forget my all time fave: Lily The Talking Panda> All of these apps have free versions; the only one I've paid for so far is Paint Joy Pro at $1.99.> & Remember - 1 FREE PAID APP A DAY here on Amazon!That's all for now folks!;oDUPDATE 3 - 9/27/2011Over 3 months and I still L-O-V-E my Thrive!  It's a cornerstone of my entertainment experience. I do take it with me when I venture out, but home is my primary use. It is ALWAYS in my lap. Instant fit in my life and fills a void no other device can.  Perfect!Here's the latest Helpful Tips I'd like to share:Project Your ThriveI recently discovered that Thrive can be hooked up to an Epson Projector, which can be invaluable for those doing business presentations. Just plug in a standard HDMI cable from Thrive to the projector, and it will project your Android tablet onto any surface. Sure, you could do this with another tab, and HDMI dongle, or micro connection, but I never like being caught in the lurch with nonstandard cables. I've been caught more than once with a proprietary cable that's failed. I much prefer the convenience and reliability of Thrive's full size onboard ports. I have a review for the Epson Multimedia Projector on that page as well.Tablets Are Touchy-FeelyFor me, a tablet is a tactile experience, hence, external keyboards and mice are not required.  I've tried them both and found them counterintuitive.  If I want to use those things, I've got a great laptop for that.  A tablet is a device that stands on its own like no other.  It is a personal item, hence, it should feel good to hold.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not a computer.  It doesn't play by the same rules.  Quite simply, it's the most personal and indispensable component of all my tech items and fills a void no other device can.More Fun Apps:> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has changed its name to AccuWeather for Honeycomb. It's still the best weather app I found; the widget is great.> Days Left -- has a neat widget that goes on your desktop and can countdown the days to special events and occasions.> Amazon AppStore has a great app that makes it easy to shop for apps and get their Free App of the Day.> Airport Mania 2 -- has become one of my favorite games. Think Chevron Toy Cars with wings! The object is to land planes at your airport, wash, paint, load & unload packages and passengers, maintain and fuel up all the planes visiting your airport, and safely send them on their way. It's like being an Air Traffic Controller, but fun!> Word Mix -- a unique word scramble game that is addictive. You can play against the clock or Puzzle Mode.> WiFi Finder -- will find free WiFi Hot Spots in a Google Earth-type layout. It finds everything in your vicinity and maps it. Be sure to download the offline database within the app, so you can use it without a WiFi connection.> Rocket Bunnies -- If you read that title without a smile on your face, then you won't have any fun playing this game!> Prize Claw -- why waste money at a stupid machine, when you can play this for free! The teddy bears are cute, too!> Paradise Island -- think Sim City> Flying Penguin -- slide on your tummy, away from the polar bear, before he eats you up!> Fat Booth -- ever wonder what you'd look like chubby?! (or people you know or stars & celebrities)> Guinea Pig Getaway -- yes, it's as adorable as the title. Tilt and move your tablet to help guide their boat and escape the big meanie chasing them.> Foto Tiles Slideshow -- turn your desktop into a collage of personal photos that change on a timer; think digital mosaic, only it's a live desktop, not a screen saver.And last, but not least, I'd like to share a post written by Pie Grrrl, in the discussion section of this review - she had a VERY interesting conversation with some techies over at Best Buy, who gave their candid impressions about Thrive and other tablets. The direct link to her post is below. In brief, here's the just of what she learned:> All of them highly coveted the Thrive; the feel, the look and the full size ports.> All of them are gamers and mostly used their tablets at home; like I said in the review, these fill a void in everyone's home entertainment experience. Personally, I live in a bit of a bubble, and my Thrive has been a natural fit in my life and a conduit to the world. It's indispensable.> 20+ tablets coming out, including a newer, thinner Thrive.  Personally, I'm excited to see what Amazon's got up their sleeve with their upcoming new tab. I'm hoping for a slide-out keyboard, not that I'm in the market or could even afford to buy! I just like drooling over new tech.> Sales are tied between the Xoom and Thrive. The Xoomer's aren't interested in the ports; the Thriver's are.> the guys loved the Android platform vs. Apple's because they loved tinkering with the tablets and rooting them. Personally, rooting is nothing to be afraid of, and gives custom access and features to any Android tablet or phone. Just be aware it voids your warranty. I'll probably be rooting my Thrive once it's a little older.Looks like Amazon removed the link, so if you're interested, just look for Pie Grrrl's post in this review's discussion section: Posted on Sep 27, 2011 3:51:40 PM PDT.And lastly, and this time I mean it, a word about NetFlix -- I've cancelled my account, but some people have found a workaround until the official app is released. Point being, it will work, but just do a Google search, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of info. Having said that, Amazon VOD works perfectly, no tinkering required.BTW -- there's a post in this review's discussion thread, where on September 7, 2011 2:48:15 PM PDT -- where U. Shelat says explains how to get NetFlix working; As I no longer have NetFlix, I cannot verify if this works or not.Okay, I lied, I have to leave you with 1 last suggestion... get the Kindle app and read Jermaine Jackson's book about his brother Michael -- it's riveting. Yes, I have a review there, too. Love reading Kindle books on m Thrive. The book is called You Are Not Alone: Michael, Through a Brother's EyesThat's all for now, folks!Go forth all, and "Androidify" your Life!(Believe it or not, I didn't just coin that, it's actually an app):oDUPDATE 4 10-18-2011Had an interesting experience with an iPad today...Ran into someone who was trying to get photos transferred to their iPad -- they fumbled with hooking it up to their laptop, syncing to iTunes, then futzed another 30 minutes unable to make anything happen.  I just smiled.  Told the person how much I genuinely admire Mr. Jobs' genius, but wouldn't it be easier to just have onboard ports like on my Thrive -?- you'd be 30 seconds away from being done.  :oD>MORE GREAT APPS:>Webroot Security - FREE anti-virus, secure web browsing and rogue app scans.  Paid version includes ability to wipe a lost device clean on command.>Thumb Keyboard - Split your tablet's keyboard to the left and right corners of the screen -- makes typing and texting just as fast as a cell phone.>Circle Launcher - A nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line.>ADA Disabled Service Members - Free Americans With Disabilities Act info for Returning Service Members.Androidify all!:oDUPDATE 5 10-21-11Thrive just got an update adding Google Video support; basically movies on demand for a small fee. Between that, and Amazon VOD playing so well on Honeycomb and the Upcoming Kindle Fire, I'm beginning to think Netflix not working on Android Tabs is no accident. Either way, Netflix's time may well have come and gone, by their own doing as much as anything else.No word on Honeycomb 3.2, though at this point, I'm more interested in Ice Cream Sandwich! (Android 4.0) I saw a video and it looks yummy!  :o)UPDATE 6  10-24-11NETFLIX -- User ID "Visa Citi" just posted in the discussion thread for this review that NetFlix is now working. I downloaded the app, but was unable to log in, because I cancelled my NetFlix account several months back. I'm not interested in rejoining, but I checked another forum and confirmed that it is working.Android 3.2 -- is due shortly. And 3 weeks tardy in my humble opinion.Android 4.0 -- is the one we all want; no word on if or when.And it just goes without saying that I have to recommend more apps. Or as I like to call this portion of the review...KAIO'S ESSENTIAL ANDROID APPS:> AllRecipes.com Dinner Spinner -- Great recipe app.> Iris Alpha -- A prototype app that mimics Siri iPhone 4s.> Circle Launcher -- One of my new faves and recent Amazon Free App o' The Day -- Unclutter your desktop with this nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. The widget contracts to a small icon that, when touched, expands to display all the icons you've enclosed within it. Can be completely customized to your preferences.Th-th-that's all folks!Enjoy and Androidify!;^DUPDATE 7 - 11/27/2011Skype - is officially working. I don't use it myself but several users have verified it.Android 3.2 - click the Service Station icon to update.  No meaningful cosmetic changes; most likely bug fixes.  No word on when 4.0 will be ready.A word about memory, by Jeffrey Peterman:"If you look at the memory on the tablet, you'll find it split into 4:1. "Normal" internal memory, the same as the base memory on a phone.2. Internal SD memory, which is internal memory allocated for storage.3. External SD memory (an inserted microSD or SD, depending on the model.)4. USB memory.The system dynamically allocated memory between 1&2, without needing any user intervention, and this memory makes up the 8, 16, or 32 GB in the tablet. The other two "spaces" (inserted memory cards and USB memory) can ONLY be used for media storage - you can't run any program from an inserted card or a thumb drive, but you can open videos or documents that are on those removable spaces."Comment posted: Nov 27/11 3:30pmThanks JeffreyThe question about memory comes up a lot; how much to get?  Do I need 8, 16 or 32gb? To me, it's not a matter of the cost of a 32gb v.s. a 16gb + SDcard.  That comparison isn't equivalent, because having all the internal memory I need is far more valuable to me than an SDcard.  I'm not a fan of splitting critical and personal files that way.  I use my SDcard to float between several devices, but it always comes down to personal preference.Here's how it approximately breaks down:> an 8gb Thrive will have about 2.5gb available> a 16gb Thrive will have about 10gb available &> a 32gb Thrive will have about 25gb available.I've tried to write & update this review so it would answer an array of basic questions that come up often.  This is new technology to everyone, and it's the beginning of an exciting, new frontier.Androidify AllKaio:oDUPDATE 8 -- 3/17/2012Durability:  Well it's been 9 months with our Thrive, and still going strong.  The chrome finish near the camera is showing slight signs of wear.  And the lock on my SD card slot gave out just the other day.  It still reads SD cards, but I guess I'll have to tape them down, so the spring doesn't shoot it across the room.  Other than that, it's physically holding up quite well.Cool Volume Boost App: I found a cool app called Volume+ that boosts the audio up to 20X on the Thrive's speakers, and I even installed it on my new LG Marquee cell phone.  The app boosts the volume nicely on both devices, and can even boost bluetooth headsets and call volume as well.WiFi Tethering:  When I got my new cell phone I had to figure out all over again how to root it and configure the hotspot so I could tether my Thrive to it, but I got it working, and have a tutorial on how I did it posted on my blog.  Just check my Amazon profile for a link to my blog if you're interested, or check my post on March 7th in the Comments of this review for more details on tethering to a cell phone.Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich:  According to Toshiba's Twitter page, the Thrive will be getting this new version of Android by the end of Spring.  FINALLY!Android Green Back Cover:  I got the green back cover for my Thrive awhile back and it looks really cool.New Kid On The Block:  Toshiba Excite came out a couple of weeks back.  It's much thinner than the Thrive, so just decide if you need Thrive's ports and exchangeable battery.  If not, take a look at the Excite; it's currently the thinnest tablet on the market.More than likely this is my final update for the Thrive.  It's been fun seeing just how long this review can get, and how many comments we can all generate!!  Thanks to Everyone for all the fun.Keep Thriving & Androidify!;oDKaio... Still just visiting Earth!

 Length:: 9:19 MinsFrom initial reaction, the Thrive seems to be pretty standard in comparison with the Acer Iconia Acer Iconia Tab A500-10S16u 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Aluminum Metallic) that I had gotten for my dad.  It feels a little thicker and has more plastic overall as the whole back is a removable plate and the design looks a little better on the Iconia.  On the inside, both seem to be pretty responsive as expected running on the Honeycomb where both can be updated to 3.2 easily by going to the settings.  Included power adapter is a bit bigger and around the same size as that of my netbook for the Thrive while the Iconia one is more travel friendly and slightly smaller.Initial impressions of the overall build and the connections are positive and will see as time goes on how it holds up when my friend starts using it.Pros:Price was pretty decent over the lightning dealsFull sized SD cardUSB port and mini USB portMini HDMI Port for outputNice display from what I played withCons:3 ports are all on one side but may not be a big issueOverall plastic feeling which may or may not be a bad thing depending on casesVideo includes unbox, updates, and playing a little with the tablet.

it good What I like:*The 7 inch format. Definitely more portable vs. the 10 inch tablets.*I can buy 4g access when I need it--no need for monthly subscription plans.*Fast processor*Ready access to the Google Apps Marketplace*GPS*Gorilla Glass*Flash Player works great*Takes an SD cardWhat I don't like:*Like many have mentioned, the battery life isn't great. But, I'm not the type to be surfing for more than 3 hrs.*The screen resolution. It's not a huge deal for me, but you can definitely see the difference when compared to other tablets.*Dell's insistance on using proprietary connectors vs. usb/mini-usb.*HDMI would have been nice.I did a lot of research prior to buying the Dell Streak 7. The Xoom and Tab have better screen resolution and battery life. But, for about the same price of a Nook Color, I got a 1 gig dual core processor and access to T-Mobile's 4g network w/o a subscription, the Dell Streak 7 from Warehouse is a great deal.

great tablet I bought this tablet for my wife. It's easy to use and does everything she needs it to do. My wife isn't the best at using a computer so the Le Pan II is a great tablet for her. She just loves it.

OK Device This tablet has a decent battery life and it runs most of the apps in the app store. some would not run because of the type of processor, or because it dosen't have the correct gyro in it. Most apps run well though.The major downfall is the proprietary charging chord. If you loose it, you are screwed, because you just can't go to Wal-Mart and get another one. If you want additional chords, you gotta order them or find them on e-bay.

Spend a Few extra $'s and get a good Tablet First let me say Amazon is and was great!!  I am thrilled with Amazon and the responsiveness and follow through.  I bought three Coby Kryos Mid 7025 Tablets for my children for Christmas.  For starters the tablets did not have access to the market.  It comes with a program called AppLibs that is supposed to be another market.  Only problem is that Applibs would never connect, even on a great wifi connection.  This was not a big deal as I quickly found the needed files, installed them on a SD card and installed the Google Market.  When you do this you get the old market since this is an older version of Android.  Doing more research I have not found an upgrade path for this device to new Android releases, and frankly I am not sure the CPU could handle it.  Biggest problem is that the devices freeze up when doing even simple stuff like listening to music or playing market games.  I have each device freeze up and lock down at least three times.  When it is not freezing up it is releasing error codes that make you do a force close.  The other big issue is the resistive touch screen.  You really have to push down hard and it's better to use a stylus or fingernail.  Using this type of screen it is easy to open applications mistakenly.  When you try to scroll throughout the screens random apps open, which is extremely frustrating.  My advice is to save your money, spend a few extra dollars and get a capacitive screen.  You may be saying, "Well, surely it's Ok just for younger kids".  Don't fool yourself, that is exactly what I said.  It's not, when they are constantly having issues and bringing it to you to fix you realize going cheap was not a great option.  Get the capacitive screen with the latest Android version.  OR, get an iPad and everyone will be happy!!

My mom loves it! We ordered this for my Mom for last Christmas and she loves it.  It's very compact for her arthritic hands and very easy to use.  If she can use it - anybody can.

Coby Kyros 8125 This is a pretty decent tablet. It does not have the android market, but does have its own that is okay. My chief complaint is that there is no easy way to install a flash player. I had to get on to youtube and watch videos showing how to download the programs onto my pc, put them on a sd card and install them on the tablet. Really inconvenient, but does work. I had to do this with the android market (which tells me that 90% of the apps will not work on my device, so that was pointless), the adobe flash player, and netflix. It is an okay tablet. Pretty fast and reliable, but I would recommend spending a little more and getting one that is capable of downloading the programs that you really want. I find it completely ridiculous that his tablet is perfectly capable of running these apps, but there is no way of adding them without having to take these steps to add them. If you simply want to watch youtube, check email and surf the web, this tablet is good. You just cannot got to sites that require flash. This means that many sites that have any video at all will not work.UPDATE!!!!!!!Junk Junk Junk Junk.... Even the sales people at my local electronics store say to run from the Coby tablets..

Excellent Choice It is very useful when you are traveling. Go and catch any wi-fi hotspot, there you are, all connected. It is truly amazing when you can go on flights without your laptops.

Better than I expected!!! (and I expected good its great) Before you read my review, I'd like to point out that you may see Acer pictures on Amazon that make it look like different machines with different prices. They are not. There are two models available the W500 (this model) has Windows home premium and W500P, has windows professional. Now on to my review of the W500:Received my Acer Iconia 32gb windows 7 W500 Tablet/ netbook from Amazon yesterday and immediately I unwrapped and fired it up mounted in the keyboard. After starting, I removed Adobe reader 9.1, Acer games, Ebay world, Skype4.1, and reloaded Skype 5.3, added Firefox with the grab and drag add on for easy tablet use, added sumatra pdf (takes no space compared to adobe9.1,  removed live essentials and more. My previous computer was a Asus T91mt tablet/netbook, right away I noticed the following about this Acer, screen is much brighter and more detailed, audio is louder especially on earphones, installed my 32gb SD card from my old computer with all my files and I could easily transfer to various folders on the computer. I adjusted the stick mouse and found it easy to operate. (But I am a old IBM user so you may want to use a USB mouse while in the keyboard mount) I have read reviews that the screen is top heavy and could fall out of the keyboard. Not so. Although the screen is heavier than the keyboard, I found it sits attached to the keyboard very nicely, I even leaned the screen and keyboard way back and it still would not tip and in fact I'm typing this review on my lap now!!! (Leaning the screen forward toward you while in the keyboard it could come out since that's how you remove the screen) Haven't experimented with the tablet yet, but I can see it is well built! Very well built! As a test, I played a 1080 blu-ray movie (the Mask) from my SD Card on this unit and it played with out a glitch. This is a movie that would not play on any of my previous netbooks and I've owned 4 of them. I have read in other reviews that this computer handles everything thrown at it. I also read the match up of the INTEL dual core 550N against this AMD C-50 CPU/GPU and the AMD blew away the intel. It took AMD 5 years to develop this special processor, a blend of a Processor and a graphics chip on one die! Very Incredible. AMD calls it a APU. Goodbye CPU! I can do everything on this machine that I do on my desktop, connected to my home wireless N in seconds, connected to my wireless HP network printer in seconds.  More to come! So far very happy! This unit blows away my former Asus T91mt tablet/netbook! I am so glad that I didn't get sucked into the hype of all the latest tablets with honeycomb 3. I'll keep my android software on my phone where it belongs! I must mention there is a review by Sticky on the other listed Acer W500 on Amazon that was very passionate and convinced me to purchase this computer and he was right on with his review!UPDATE:It has only been a few days later. I can't stop playing with this unit!!  I skyped with my grand daughter 50 miles away and the incoming picture and  audio was perfect. I was told my audio was noisy (I later found the microphone setting in windows was boosted to 30+) I adjusted that. I can't think of one item I don't like about this computer. Its so quiet! Tablet is bright, very detailed and easy to surf the web etc. The tablet has a nice  border, which makes the unit easy to hold so you are not putting your fingers on the glass. Bought a Targus capacitive stylus. Perfect for drawing and writing and browsing on the tablet. This is a must have, especially if you use the Microsoft journal that comes with the netbook for writing or printing notes directly on he screen. (Plus it keeps the glass clean) Tablet is fantastic, it came from the factory with a clear very thin plastic screen cover. You can use the screen with the cover on or take it off. I peeled mine off, but I didn't notice a difference in response. Screen is very responsive. I haven't read all the gestures that can be performed, I know if you hold your finger or stylus on the screen it will act like a mouse right click. I like the windows button (which lights blue), which allows you to access the task bar and start menu with ease. My old Asus tablet had a problem accessing the task bar especially if you set it to hide position. Not with this unit! Still experimenting!UPDATE: (a week later)Love this machine. Purchased the Targus TSM148US mini bag. It is in my opinion the perfect bag for this machine, holds the keyboard and screen with plenty of room for your power supply and earphones , capacitive stylus and more etc. I also purchased the tablet holder by Arkon, it is a folding tablet stand and this solves the problem for people that complained that the screen doesn't fold while attached to the keyboard. Works like it was built for this tablet!  I am also using my android phone with PdaNet app to get internet on the train via blue-tooth. Very cool! I'm easily getting 6 hrs of battery life browsing the web, even more with the wifi off and reading my Ebooks using kindle, my skype sessions with my grand daughter are incredible! The video and audio are perfect! Also I like Internet explorer 9 as a touch browser. This Acer is better than any previous netbook I have owned. This  machine is a keeper. Brightest screen I have owned in a netbook, great screen detail, with windows 7 I can do everything I need in a computer! I could go on and on.UPDATE (1 month later)All the above still stands, this is to date the best netbook/pc I have ever owned. It is super quiet, bright screen and nice clean resolution. There is a new bios update at the Acer site. I ran it and upgraded my bios to 1.08 This is truly a very well built tablet and after a month of use, I'm enjoying it more and more. I just played a HD Movie file that was 1920 x 1080 with not even a glitch. My dual-core 2.5ghz desktop at work can't play this file with out glitches/pauses. This machine is incredible! One last point, I don't remember if I mentioned it in the past but this computer has been reported to accept SDXC cards. Why is this important? SDXC are the newest SD cards and they can go up to 2 terabytes!!  Of course at this time a 2 terabyte card would cost you 5k, but you can purchase a 64gb sdxc card for about $115 dollars and this means this computer unlike many other tablets will always have the room for your future programs!UPDATE (2 months later)Everything above still stands. In fact, my main laptop was a HP 14 inch dual core machine. I gave it to my brother, this Acer is my main laptop, Netbook, Tablet, what ever you wish to call it. Bright screen and very quiet. BTW, I stopped using pdanet and switched to the virgin mobile 2200 mifi to get internet on the train. It is a fantastic product. No contract, buy from wally and you will get a free 1gb upgrade of data per month.UPDATE (January 2013)For those that will question a use of a windows tablet. There is no doubt that if you want a tablet, a windows tablet has many more functions then a android tablet and windows 8 is perfect to install on this unit. For the year 2011 this was a nice tablet/laptop but now its 2013 and OMG there are so many choices out there with windows 8 already installed. There is the HP surface, the Lenovo ideapad, the Lenovo twist and much more. All these mentioned are now better than this machine. Technology gets better every year. So I too have moved on, Presently I am using the Acer Aspire one 722 netbook with the C60 processor but I am looking at one of these models mentioned above. For those who still have their Acer w 500 I bet you installed windows 8 on it to improve touch screen functionality! Right now its the only way to go!

best tablet After waiting for a longtime and reviewing all the tablets in market, took a decision to by the Acer iconia tab. I am very happy that I bought a Android tablet instead of apple one. Acer a500 is working fine me,gps,camera and HD video resolution is good,I tested USB,hdmi,SD card all are working as expected. And I am typing this review from Acer tablet since I didn't touch my laptop day I got it. I am still learning android to make full use of it.

Esta muy bueno Esta tablet cumple con todo lo que esperaba de ella, tiene un balance perfecto, la puedes usar tanto para trabajar como para divertirte. Trae la aplicacion Quick Office que hace que puedas trabajar con documentos de Microsoft Office sin problemas. El procesador Tegra de nvidia es muy poderoso, lo probe con algunos juegos y el resultado es genial.Es muy liviana y maleable, recomiendo la compra del film protector para la pantalla ya que sin l se llena facilmente de huellas dactilares. Ojo que esta version no viene con 3G. solo con wifi, pero la relacion costo/beneficio compensa.Tampoco tiene una ranura para memoria SD, pero si te compras el adaptador para USB puedes conectarle un pen drive sin problemas.Es cierto que al android 3.1 le falta madurar, casi no consigo juegos gratis en el market que sean compatibles pero creo que eso se va a solucionar al rato.

A great device WHEN you consider price and function, with a few flaws UPDATE November 2012 - With the Kindle Fire HD out now, I highly recommend it over this older version, as it fixes many of the problems I mention in my review.  No one should buy this original version of the Kindle Fire unless you can get it for very cheap.  I would also recommend theKindle Fire HD 8.9" over the 7" Fire, as I feel the increased size has a dramatic effect on the tablet experience.The first and most important thing that should be said about the Kindle Fire is that this is not an "iPad-killer."  It is not designed to be.  I have seen so many articles and comments comparing this to the iPad, and surveys where people are asked if they will be buying a Kindle Fire over an iPad this Christmas.  If you are expecting an iPad, or even a tablet, you will be disappointed.  The main purpose of this device is to deliver Amazon content to you more effectively.  It is designed for consumption, not creation. That is the reason it is so cheap and why Amazon is taking a loss on it.  They are hoping to make up for that loss through sales of videos, music, books, and apps through Amazon's Web Services.  You can also use it to view your own movies and media, but will find that it is more limited in that way than a regular tablet.  Personally, as someone who has ordered several rentals from Amazon Video, and had to contact customer support for every single one of them due to problems with Amazon's Unbox player or purchases not appearing in my downloads, I can really appreciate this.  But if you don't plan on using Amazon at all to obtain your media, you may want to take this into consideration before purchasing the Fire.  Additionally, the reason this product is so hyped, and one of the reasons I like it so much, is due to the ridiculously low price.  Amazon reviews shouldn't focus on price, but it is hard not to with this device.  On price alone, this is a five star device.  However when looked at the Fire overall, and when compared with other touch devices (what little there is to compare it to), I have to give it four stars, since there are a few areas I feel could use definite improvement.FORM FACTOR - The Kindle Fire feels almost the same in my hand as my 3rd generation Kindle but it is a bit heavier.  It might be difficult to hold it one handed and read a book for an hour or watch a movie. You're going to need to rest it on something.  The display is made of Gorilla Glass, which is a highly damage-resistant.  You can still crack it, but I have used a phone with Gorilla Glass for two years on it and it has zero scratches on it despite being kept daily in my pocket with my keys.  The back of the tablet is rubberized, so it won't slide around and won't get scratched easily.  It also feels good in my hand.  Despite all the companies that will be selling them, I do not think you need a screen protector.  I have scratched Gorilla Glass before, but it is very difficult to do.CONNECTIONS/STORAGE - On the bottom are a headphone port (which will accept external speakers), micro-USB (for charging and file transfer), and power button.  The Fire doesn't come with an SD card slot, with good reason.  As mentioned, Amazon wants you to get content directly from them.  It also reduces the production costs.  You can transfer your own content to the device through the USB connection from your home computer.  The Fire comes with 8Gb of storage, which is enough to hold about 8 downloaded movies, 80 apps, 800 songs, or 6,000 books. I filled mine up right away so I never checked it out of the box, but apparently it is closer to 6.5Gb as the OS is going to take up some of this.  You have to really become adept at managing your content through the Cloud. Books won't take up much room, but magazines are around 250Mb and movies are a little under 1 Gb.  Free videos available through Amazon Prime cannot be downloaded, only streamed.  So unless you buy a movie from Amazon or transfer one of your own, you must be connected through a wi-fi connection in order to watch your movie.AMAZON CLOUD - If you have not tried out the Amazon Cloud Drive, you will be pleasantly surprised. You get 5Gb (which they will probably increase in the near future) of free online storage to store anything you want, and you can access it from anywhere.  This combines very nicely with the Fire.  5Gb isn't much for my collection, so I upgraded to a higher plan (rates are $1 per extra gigabyte per year).  I can upload a playlist to it and listen to it on my home computer, then when I get to work the Fire can access it and pick it up where I left off.  Any songs you get from Amazon Mp3 are automatically stored on the Cloud and don't contribute to the 5Gb storage space.E-READER - This was going to be the big determination in whether I should get a Fire or the new Kindle Touch.  Ultimately I ended up getting both since I prefer the E-Ink technology to the backlit display of the Fire.  If you are the type of person who reads a lot and expect to spend at least 50% of your use on reading books, I don't think you will be satisfied with the Fire over your Kindle 3 or the Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers. It just isn't the same, and after hours of reading, the display would make my eyes hurt a bit (just like with any tablet).  However it is nice not to have to use a lighted cover to see my books in the dark.  The Kindle Fire is difficult to read in bright sunlight or on the beach.  The touch navigation is very nice, but it doesn't function as nicely or quickly as it does on the iPad or even the Kindle Touch. This can be a problem for me, and the main reason I am using the Kindle Touch for reading books. Additionally, the Fire doesn't support real page numbers, even though the Touch does. So you have to use that ridiculous "location 121 of 16077 - 2%" format. A year of that with my last Kindle and I still don't understand what that means.  They need to fix this in an update.  Being able to touch a word and have it bring up the dictionary is incredibly convenient and takes less than 2 seconds.  But still, the Kindle Touch handily beats the Fire for reading.MAGAZINES - The Kindle Fire can also handle magazines, however the display is just too small to be an enjoyable reading experience.  I tried out several different magazines, and the main problem I had was with the formatting.  I tried to read an issue of Bon Appetit and my eyes were straining after three pages.  There is no way to read a single article without zooming. The Fire handles magazines two ways: with Page View, which shows the original magazine display, and with Text View, which attempts to just provide the text of the article. A lot of magazines these days have several things going on in one page, with multiple columns, little sidebars and boxes everywhere, etc.  I couldn't view a lot of this without zooming, the text is just too small.  So Page View did not work very well for magazines like this.  It is especially tough with magazines like Entertainment Weekly, Men's Health, GQ, etc.  I found magazines like that unreadable on the 7" display.  Magazines that focused mostly on the article, like Nature, Wired, etc, were handled much better.  Some magazines even come integrated with embedded video and audio, which is a very nice feature, and one I can see being very useful for things like Men's Health, but I haven't had as much of a chance to use it yet.  Text View is a very nice feature that works mostly well, but seems to get a bit confused with magazines that have complicated formatting, so it pretty much defeats the purpose since those are the ones I need it for the most.COMIC READER - This is one of the main reasons I purchased the Fire.  Amazon has a fairly extensive collection of comic books available for the Fire, including an exclusive deal with DC to publish many of their books.  In addition to a proprietary comic reader that comes on the Fire, Amazon also has a Comics by ComiXology app available to purchase issues and subscriptions through. Although I initially thought the 7" display would be too small, it is actually decent enough to serve as a comic reader.  I would definitely prefer a 10" version if they came out with one in the future. A 10" tablet is still the way to go for comics, but if you're looking for a cheaper option and portability, the Fire isn't too bad, and definitely beats a smart phone.  It has a "panel by panel" feature that lets you scroll through the issue by different panels, which it will then zoom in on. You tap the panel when done, and it moves to the next panel.  This is great for getting a larger view and working around the size restriction, especially since some of the text in the comics is just too small to read.  Although it is fairly decent, if you are considering the Fire just for comic books, and you are a Marvel fan, you may want to hold off and look at another retailer's device which I think has a few more options.  You can load your own .cbr comic files on the Kindle, but you'll need to use a third party app, like Comicat to do it.AMAZON MP3/VIDEO - Amazon hopes that you will get the majority of your content from them. That is why the Fire is so reasonably-priced.  Amazon music is DRM-free.  DRM is copy protection.  That means that the record labels haven't locked down the music you buy from Amazon to restrict how you use it.  Amazon MP3 music is playable anywhere, even on your Apple devices.  It also has a very high bitrate so you are getting great quality. You don't have to worry about not being able to listen to your music 15 years from now if Amazon goes under. It's yours forever.  As far as video, I have always disliked Amazon's Video services.  The prices are very reasonable and they now have a huge selection, but obtaining the videos is a huge pain due to Amazon's terrible Unbox player. That changes with the Fire, as everything is native and streams/downloads beautifully.  If you make a lot of purchases with Amazon, or if you have several Amazon customers in your household, you should take advantage of their Prime program.  In addition to the large selection of free videos now available to Prime members, the shipping advantages are amazing. I once had a 200 lb exercise bike overnighted to my house for only $3.99.  Everything I order I get within 2 days. The Prime program seems expensive but it has certainly paid for itself over the years for me, and now is even better that it is integrated more with the Fire.  The only problem I have with video playback is that everything I watched did not fully expand to the screen, and was letterboxed.  Considering the small 7" display size, this was an annoyance for me.  I know shows have different aspect ratios, but some should fit the display, and I think many users will be annoyed that they can't zoom or stretch the display to fit.WEB BROWSING - This is another feature I was initially excited about. I like the idea of being able to use the Fire as a netbook.  Amazon advertises "ultra fast web browsing" using Amazon's Silk browser.  It is based off of technology that is designed to increase page loading times by pre-fetching part of the content.  Sounds like a great idea, but doesn't work as well in practice.  I tried out the Fire on several different connections and compared page loading times with other devices (all connected wirelessly).  The Fire was one of the slowest.  Amazon's own web page, which has actually recently been optimized to work with the Fire, takes an average of 7 seconds to load. Other major portals took a similar amount of time or slower. My iPad and my Xoom both load pages much faster.  It is not slow enough to be a problem, but not fast enough to impress me or be worthy of Amazon's marketing regarding it.  This needs to be improved. UPDATE - As of February 2012, page loading times are much improved. It can still be a bit slow and stutter at times, but you can increase this by following the steps at the bottom of this review.  I am mostly satisfied with browsing now, although Silk still occasionally won't recognize it when I touch a link.BATTERY LIFE - Amazon advertises 8 hours of reading or 7.5 hours of video playback.  As an average, that's probably fairly accurate.  During testing I got an average of 7.4 hours of continuous reading, and 7 hours of video playback over five tests for each.  This is a big change over the roughly 30 days of continuous reading with the traditional kindle, so it may hamper you a bit if you're a voracious reader.  I just got into the habit of charging it every night with my cell phone.  You can shut down the Kindle or put it in sleep mode.  I keep mine in sleep mode all the time because it is so efficient that it uses almost no battery. I can leave it in sleep mode for 2 days and come back and not notice any change in battery life, and since I don't have to reboot, it starts up immediately.VS IPAD - As said, this isn't designed to be an iPad.  I have an iPad and there is so much more I can do with it compared to the Kindle. The Fire serves a different (but sometimes similar) function.  I just don't ever see Amazon building up the type of app store that Apple has, and that's where you're going to find the major differences. Additionally, the 10" display on the iPad makes a huge difference to me over the Fire's 7" display when it comes to watching movies and TV, and reading magazines and comic books.  However, I think there is definitely room for the Fire to steal some of iPad's market share, as many people (I am one of them), will find the functions they want in a tablet can be covered by the Fire.USER INTERFACE - The Fire uses a heavily modified version of Android.  I really liked the interface, however I don't think it works as well on the Fire as it does on a full tablet device like the Motorola Xoom.  Occasionally I would try to make a page turn and have it not register on the Fire, or have it register more slowly than I am used to.  If you have a lot of experience with the iPad, you are going to notice that the software doesn't respond as quickly on the Fire as it does with other tablets.  Although this is an inconvenience and something I definitely feel needs to be addressed, I can accept it given the lower price point.  I will have a problem though if this is not resolved through a firmware upgrade in the future.  The Fire's custom version of Android is very nice.  The most recent applications or files accessed will display in a carousel format that you can rotate through.  You can also set up commonly-used applications as favorites. If you want to access movies and pictures that you manually load onto the Fire, you have to open up the "Gallery" app, rather than accessing them from the "Videos" and "Photos" tabs.  The gallery app does not very user-friendly at displaying these files. For instance, it just creates thumbnails for all your video files and doesn't let you view the file names when selecting a video. If you have dozens of videos from a single TV show, there is no easy way to organize them in the gallery. It's clear Amazon wants you to view their videos purchased from them rather than your own. I would really like to see them fix this through a simple firmware update but I doubt they will.NEGATIVES:- No bluetooth and no HDMI.  I could really use bluetooth for integration with bluetooth-capable speakers and so I can use bluetooth audio in my car. As a media player, I feel this really should have been included, and I imagine it will with future versions.  This is especially important since the audio from the speakers is a bit tinny and weak.  I have been using headphones with all my media-playing, which significantly improves the sound. There is also no physical volume button, which is a pain when you need to silence the device quickly (EDIT: You can sideload the "Volume Control" app by RubberBigPepper" from the Android Market for a great software workaround to this).  I also would like HDMI output so I can take my Amazon video purchases and watch them on my TV.  Another big disadvantage in a device that is made for media.  This will also likely be included in a future edition, so at $200, I don't feel bad about possibly having to upgrade a year from now to get it.- Only 8Gb storage space.  As mentioned, this device is mainly designed to integrate with Amazon's Cloud, so 8 should be enough, but it would be nice to have at least 16.  I imagine Amazon did this on purpose to force people to use their Cloud service.- Touch capability can sometimes be sluggish.  iPad and other tablet owners may be disappointed with the touch reaction time and some aspects of the software.- Video doesn't include option to zoom or stretch the display to fit the screen.- Very limited selection of apps from the Amazon App Store. Most of the apps are mediocre games. UPDATE - you can get around this by manually loading apps onto the Fire. Do a search for "sideload kindle fire."  It is very easy.- Web "Accelerator" is not as fast as other tablets.- No Micro-USB transfer cable included with it.  Another way for Amazon to discourage you from transferring your own files to the device. If you want to do that, you will need to purchase one separately, like the AmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters).SUMMARY: Bottom line, you will not find a cheaper device out there for streaming music, video, and books than the Kindle Fire.  The reason that this device is so amazing is not for what it can do, but for what it can do at such a cheap price.  The price tag, not the technology, is the story here.  Although I definitely feel there is room for improvement and will be interested in seeing Amazon's second generation of this device (which I think will be significantly improved), the Kindle Fire is a solid start.  If you can wait a year or more for Amazon to work out the kinks with the Fire (like it did with its 1st generation of the Kindle), you should definitely do that. The next version should fix a lot of the problems that keep the current Fire from being a "Five Star" product.  Unfortunately, reviews shouldn't focus on price, so due to some issues with the form factor and touch interface, I can only give it four stars. It is just not "perfect" enough for me to say it is a five star product without taking price into consideration.  But aside for that, there is really only one device you can compare the Fire to - The Nook.  So for what it is, I would have no problems recommending the Fire to consumers who can take advantage of it.  This product more than lives up to what it is DESIGNED to do.  If you plan on getting most of your content from Amazon AND you have a Prime membership, I think you will really find this is a pretty incredible device for the money.UPDATE 28 Dec 2011: After getting a new case for the Fire that makes it easier to hold, I'm starting to use it more for reading (although I still prefer my Kindle Touch for anything over about 45 minutes).  Some magazines are now better adapted to the Fire liked my subscription to Wired, and some are still terrible and just compressed PDFs. An update released last week adds more privacy features so you can delete recent history form the carousel, and does improve noticeably on the touch sensitivity, although it can still be frustrating at times and not as smooth as something like an iPad.  Browser loading times are still disappointing, but not as bad as they were at first release, and I don't notice them as much.  I am continually impressed at battery usage for this device. Despite using it less than an hour a day, I never turn it off and only charge it a couple times a week.  The rest of the time it sits in standby mode which is extremely efficient.  If they could improve a couple more options I'd be closer to giving the Fire five stars.UPDATE 7 Feb 2012: I have been able to update the browser significantly by doing the following: Open up the browser and select the menu button at the bottom, select the Settings button, and then change the following options:Enable plug-ins: Change this to "off."  This will disable Flash, so if you have any web sites that need it you can re-enable it (YouTube works fine).Accelerate page loading: Uncheck this. If your wifi connection is decent, it's not really necessary.Mobile (This one is optional, but I prefer to view everything in mobile mode rather than having Silk trying to force a desktop view on a 7" screen."

For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia *UPDATE 8* Now Up:  See the addendum at the end of this review.I pre-ordered the 32gb Thrive here on Amazon, but got impatient and went to a local retailer just to check them out. We loved this tab so much, we got a 2nd for my husband in 16gb.Toshiba BrandFirst off -- No -- I do not work for Toshiba. But I fell in love with the brand a little over a year ago when I bought a new Qosmio laptop, and it's BY FAR the best computer I have ever owned.  I love it as much today as the day I got it, so when I found out Toshiba had an Android Tab, I had to take a serious look.Galaxy & Iconia in BriefPrior to learning about Thrive, I was seriously considering the new 10" Galaxy Tab.  I had been coveting the 8" model for some time, but just wasn't ready to take the leap.  So when the 10" came along, I just had to stop by a local retailer to try one out hands-on.  And I must say, I really fell in love with it -- the screen is vivid and stunning, the interface is clean and responsive.  And it's super thin for sure.  But, the first thing I noticed was there's no inputs of any kind; no SD slot, no USB, no nada.  The sales rep said that's because everything is trending toward the "cloud."  Well, that's all well and good, but I like products that I control, not products that control me (hence why I'm no fan of Apple's line of iShackle products.  I'm all for "the cloud" and have one here on Amazon for my music, but I'm also the type that prefers to have my own stuff stored locally.  I also like to get into the nuts and bolts of my peripherals and use them my way, so having no inputs on the Galaxy was a huge letdown for me.  I left the store feeling underwhelmed, and like it wasn't the right time to buy a tablet.  But I was bitten by the bug so I went home and started researching other tabs.Reviews here on Amazon had me convinced Acer Iconia was better than Asus Transformer.  And the Acer had USB inputs, so I was happy with that.  But I've never been a big fan of Acer, so I still wasn't feeling the itch just yet.  But then I stumbled upon the Toshiba Thrive, and still being so highly impressed with their laptop, I immediately felt a connection to the Thrive.Every Input I'll Ever NeedThrive has SD card, USB, mini-USB and full size HDMI ports.  And for me, this is where Thrive clobbers the competition -- Toshiba just "gets it;" they make products that keep the end user in control and offer a truly freeing experience.  I have a full size HDMI port on my Toshiba laptop too, and let me tell you, it completely changed my computing experience!  My laptop is connected to a 50" plasma TV and I use a wireless keyboard and gyration remote for a mouse.  Let me tell you, once you use a computer that way, there's just no going back.  So all those inputs on the Thrive was a big clincher for me -- and once again, Toshiba stands head and shoulders above the rest in this department.  I fully expect to connect my tablet to my HDTV as well.  And the on-board SD and USB ports assure I'll have all the computing freedom and control I've come to expect.Vibrant Screen and ColorWhen I first saw the Thrive at my local electronics store, I was a bit concerned the screen wasn't as vibrant as the Galaxy.  But then I remembered Thrive has an auto brightness feature, so I was wondering if that was limiting the saturation in some way.  I was easily able to find and navigate the setup menus right there in the store, turned off auto-brightness -- and voila! -- the Thrive's screen was every bit as vibrant and rich as the Galaxy!  The colors and clarity are nothing short of stunning.  I hate to say it, but the screen is probably better than my 50" plasma (it's only a couple years old, which already makes it a relic in tech world.)Ease of UseFor me, the truest test of any piece of tech, is the ability to use it straight out of the box with NO help from user manuals.  I got a new printer recently and had to fiddle with it for days because the install didn't set it up properly -- and in my book -- that's a sure sign of a piece of junk.  This Thrive, however, was very simple and easy to get the hang of within minutes right there in the store.  Naturally, that's as much a testament to Android 3.1 as it is to Toshiba Thrive.  Either way, I was doing everything from surfing the net, to customizing the entire interface and settings in minutes, all right there in the store -- no user manuals, no nothing.  I even tethered it to my cell phone just for fun.  The interface is so smooth and responsive, and the Tegra CPU is clearly a beast; no hangs, locking or delays of any kind.  Everything was fast, smooth and clean; just the way it should be.  In fact, Thrive loaded and buffered YouTube videos better than the Galaxy, though there could be many reasons for that given all the devices on the store's WiFi network.Rubberized BackSome might not think much of this, but believe me, it's pretty awesome and makes the Thrive feel like velvet in my hands!  It also gives me confidence in the tablet's durability and build quality.  By contrast, both the Galaxy and Iconia have a hard, slick back, and as a result, I personally found them both harder to hang on to.  I'm disabled and easily drop things, so I never felt fully confident holding either the Galaxy or Iconia.  All of these tabs are just a few weeks old, and it's worth pointing out that the backs of both the Galaxy and Iconia were scuffed and scratched to the point of making them look junky.  Granted, they're both display models in a high traffic store, but the physical condition of both these tabs after only a couple weeks on display suggests one can expect the same blemishes from personal use over time.  By contrast, the Thrive's rubber backing assures there'll be no scuffs or scratches on my tab or anything I set it down on.  And if it does wear out, I can just buy a new backing in one of 6 cool colors.ThicknessYes, the Thrive is probably twice as thick as the Galaxy, but I'm ok with that.  Especially since it isn't all that much heavier.  I think the added thickness is due to the USB and HDMI inputs the Galaxy is lacking.  Personally, I'd rather have a slightly thicker tab with all the inputs I want, than a wafer thin tab that has a USB dongle dangling from it that I always have to remember to carry.  Smaller and thinner isn't always better, at least not for my taste.  I don't want a 10" wafer thin screen that I'm scared to drop or set down anywhere, or that will easily get scratched or cracked.  The Galaxy just doesn't feel very durable, nor did the Iconia.  While the added thickness and rubberized back make the Thrive feel more durable; like it could survive being accidentally dropped, or if placed on a table, the rubber backing would help it survive minor spills.  Being disabled, I need something durable, and to that end, the Thrive feels like it will easily outlast both the Galaxy and Iconia.  And we're not talking a super thick tablet here; it's still plenty thin.  It's also very light; if not, my hands would cramp up and I wouldn't be able to grasp it to begin with.Wider Body - More To Get My Paws On!The Thrive is a bit wider than both the Galaxy and the Iconia -- the screen size is the same on all 3, but the Thrive's casing is about half an inch wider, which is great because it gives me a little more edge to hang on to without my fingers covering part of the screen.  I have big hands, so this all adds up to a good thing for me.  Overall, the Thrive just feels better in my hands, and more sturdy and durable.Screen ProtectorsI'm a fan of those "helicopter blade" screen protectors and have been using them on all my touch screen devices for years.  I went ahead and ordered a full body protector for my 32gb Thrive pre-order.  But after getting my hands on my husband's 16gb Thrive, I'm realizing I don't want to cover the velvety rubber back of my Thrive with a screen protector.  They haven't arrived yet, but I'm hoping we can use the back of the screen protector on the front of our 16gb Thrive (both pieces appear to be the same shape and size.  If not, no biggie, we'll just order another screen protector.  I'm a big believer in screen protection and they've saved me from accidental scratches more than once.Entertainment HubI've read that Tablets are trying to edge themselves into being the conduit that connects all your devices -- TV, cell phone, computer, etc.  And after getting this Thrive in my hands, I can see how tablets can easily fill that void.  I love my Qosmio laptop, but prefer not to take it away from home.  And my smartphone is great, but the screen is just too small to enjoy surfing the net on it.  But now with the Thrive, I can stay connected and still enjoy a full-fledged experience on the go, or even at home, all in the palm of my hands.  I've never been much into social networking, but I'm realizing that for someone with limited mobility, this might be my conduit to the outside world.  I can totally see how using this tab in a social aspect while watching TV would broaden and enhance my experience.  I just may get into Twitter too, and all that thanks to this Thrive!  Duh -- I'm starting to get why they named it that to begin with!Replaceable BatterySome people might find this meaningless.  But I just had to replace the battery in my expensive Harmony remote and it's only 2 years old.  So for me, having a replaceable battery in an expensive tablet its HUGE!  No other brand offers this but Thrive.Bottom Line -- my head is reeling a bit from the thought of owning 2 tablets.  It's really not an expense we can afford and I should probably cancel my 32gb pre-order here at Amazon or return this 16gb.  But we love it so much...  I guess we'll see what happens.  Either way, I really love this tablet and am VERY happy with it.  Every once in a while, a product comes along that fits my life like a glove.  Last time, it was Toshiba's Qosmio laptop.  This time, it's their Thrive tablet.  These are the first 2 Toshiba products I've owned, and I must say, I think Toshiba has won me over for life.  The quality, ease of use, superior construction and forward thinking innovation -- I'm sold; hands down.  There are plenty of tablets out there to choose from.  Just do your research and find the one that fits you.  For me, that's Toshiba Thrive.  I LOVE this tablet!!7/22/11 UPDATE -- Tips & Tricks:After using both 16gb and 32gb Thrive's for a couple weeks, I thought I'd add this addendum to my review:HDMI DUAL VIEWHook up the Thrive to your HDTV and the screen will display simultaneously on Thrive and your TV; Angry Birds on a 50" plasma - FUN!  I got a 25' HDMI cable, but am looking into wireless.  Picture is stunning.  BTW -- there's a reason why HDTVs _don't_ use mini or micro HDMI -- because the signal isn't as good as full-size HDMI, and only Thrive has that capability.DON'T USE A USB HUBI've had spotty results transferring files to Thrive when plugged into a hub.  But when I plug the Thrive directly into my laptop's USB port, I've had no issues and transfers are quite fast. (Win 7 Pro 64bit)FIREWALLS CAN BLOCK APPSI was initially having problems downloading apps from the Market while on my home WiFi, but then I realized my router's firewall was blocking some of Thrive's inbound traffic. So I set up 2 simple Port Forwarding rules, and voila, problem solved.BATTERY LIFEThrive charges in a about 1 hour; slightly longer if you're using it while charging.  So far, I've been getting 14-26 hours per charge while using Thrive on and off throughout the day.  My screen is set to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned off.  I leave WiFi on and just let Thrive go into sleep mode when not in use; naturally, the battery lasts even longer if I completely shut down at night.  Yesterday, I started the day with 50% battery life left -- I played Angry Birds for 4 hrs straight, watched YouTube for an hour, surfed the net and checked email for another hour, and read a book for 90min -- all that before the battery finally died and needed a recharge.  There's nothing scientific about my tally, but Thrive is giving me great battery life, IMO.ADOBE FLASH, FAST SURFING & PAGE LOADSSurfing the net is NOTHING like on my phone.  Web pages load as fast as my laptop and I can have several tabs open at the same time.  Fast, smooth and responsive.  Flash works great.  Haven't run into a website yet that doesn't work.EXTERNAL USB & FLASH DRIVESMake sure they are formatted with FAT (not NTFS) and you'll have no problems.  I even hooked up an external 500gb Western Digital My Passport drive with no issues.WHY 32gb IS BETTER THAN 16 or 8gbThrive comes pre-loaded with many apps; some useful, like Toshiba File Manager and Service Station; some not so useful, and they can't be deleted.  Point being -- I've never heard anyone complain about having too much HD space.  So do yourself a favor and get the largest GB you can afford.  SD cards, IMO, are for convenience, NOT for extending your storage capacity and running apps off it.  I use mine to view and transfer pics off my digital camera.FUN & HELPFUL APPS>Advanced WiFi Lock Free -- this solves the dreaded wake from sleep issue.  Go into the app's settings and UN-check "Enable Timeout."  Prior to this, I experienced the issue twice, but since installing this app, the wake from sleep issue has disappeared.  I do sometimes have to push the power button twice to get it to wake from sleep.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints about how the buttons work.>Talking Panda Free -- fun for kids of all ages!>Amazon Kindle -- read your digital books on Thrive.  Just wish it had text-to-speech.>DirecTV -- program your DVR(s) on the go and never miss a fave TV program.>Angry Birds -- I never thought I'd get into this game, but it really is fun.  Rio is my favorite edition.>Paint Joy -- finger painting on your tablet.  Save, share and even watch a time-lapsed rendition of your creations; kinda fun!  Let loose your inner artist!THRIVE PORTFOLIO CASEI got this case for outings away from home.  But at home, I prefer using Thrive without the case.  The Thrive is thicker than Galaxy, but I probably would have left Galaxy in it's case, because I didn't like how slick it felt.  So Thrive without a case is about the same thickness as with Galaxy with a case.ENTERTAINMENT CENTERThrive has already become another component of my home entertainment system.  I use it simultaneously while watching TV or even surfing the net on my laptop, which is hooked up to my 50" plasma.  The Thrive has become an addition and a natural extension of my home entertainment center.That's it for now; I'll add more in time, if I think of anything.9/5/2011 UPDATE 2 - over 2 months and still loving my Thrive.  Here's a couple extra helpful tips:HDTV VIA THRIVEWe took our Thrive on vacation with us for our anniversary (happy 21st to us!) and hooked it up to the hotel's 42" HDTV.  Thanks to Thrive's full-sized HDMI port, we easily ran a 25' cable right to our bed and watched our fave TV shows right off the TV network's websites while connected to the hotel's free WiFi.THRIVE DOCKDo yourself a favor and get one if the expense fits your budget. It's a tad overpriced at $50 with no power supply (it uses the one that came with Thrive) but it doubles as a great lap stand and makes charging the Thrive much more convenient; just slip it in and out of the cradle.  Don't like how the adapter fits into the Thrive itself and the dock solves that problem.  Also, Thrive looks great on display in the dock too.  I suppose if you don't mind changing the screen timeout a lot, you could even use it as a digital picture frame (just be careful with that if running off the battery.  I have a review for the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI too if you're interested.PORT FORWARDINGI was going to post specifics in my last update, but thought it might be different for everyone and didn't want to misinform.  But in case it helps anyone, here's how I fixed the problem I had with downloading apps from the Market on my home WiFi:I have my router's firewall set to high, and when I played around with the different security levels, I noticed the 2 that were blocking my Thrive were Real A/V port 7070 and T120 port 1503. I set 2 specific rules and opened those ports for my Thrive, and then the Market apps downloaded without issue. (these were both inbound traffic.  You have to know a little about port forwarding for this to make sense, but it's not that hard to do; a quick Google search never hurts. :-)MORE GREAT APPS> Scrabble is interesting because you can play online over time. I have 30 games going any given week. The app is a bit buggy, but it's still fun and I'm sure they'll improve on it.> Documents To Go is half off @ $7.99 in the Amazon AppStore> Twitter - works well but I'm still learning and don't tweet much, mostly follow.> Gmail comes standard with the tab. GDocs and all of Google's stuff is awesome.> GOOGLE SKY helped us find Jupiter, Mars, all the planets and stars in our solar system last night!! CQQL!!> The Kroger app lets me add digital coupons to my grocery store club card.> DirecTV Remote controls my TV's DVR; kinda neat.> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has a neat widget where you can flick up or down to change the temperature amongst your saved locations> Cloudy is a fun paper airplane game> PhotoShop Express is free and always good to have.> MXvideo Player has neat swipe controls that make it easy to forward, pause and reverse vids while they are playing.> the Bookmarks widget that comes standard with the tab lets you scroll through thumbnails of each web page.> Vevo and TV.com apps have some good content> Fruit Ninja is surprisingly fun; I like Zen Mode.  It speaks to my inner samurai.> and don't forget my all time fave: Lily The Talking Panda> All of these apps have free versions; the only one I've paid for so far is Paint Joy Pro at $1.99.> & Remember - 1 FREE PAID APP A DAY here on Amazon!That's all for now folks!;oDUPDATE 3 - 9/27/2011Over 3 months and I still L-O-V-E my Thrive!  It's a cornerstone of my entertainment experience. I do take it with me when I venture out, but home is my primary use. It is ALWAYS in my lap. Instant fit in my life and fills a void no other device can.  Perfect!Here's the latest Helpful Tips I'd like to share:Project Your ThriveI recently discovered that Thrive can be hooked up to an Epson Projector, which can be invaluable for those doing business presentations. Just plug in a standard HDMI cable from Thrive to the projector, and it will project your Android tablet onto any surface. Sure, you could do this with another tab, and HDMI dongle, or micro connection, but I never like being caught in the lurch with nonstandard cables. I've been caught more than once with a proprietary cable that's failed. I much prefer the convenience and reliability of Thrive's full size onboard ports. I have a review for the Epson Multimedia Projector on that page as well.Tablets Are Touchy-FeelyFor me, a tablet is a tactile experience, hence, external keyboards and mice are not required.  I've tried them both and found them counterintuitive.  If I want to use those things, I've got a great laptop for that.  A tablet is a device that stands on its own like no other.  It is a personal item, hence, it should feel good to hold.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not a computer.  It doesn't play by the same rules.  Quite simply, it's the most personal and indispensable component of all my tech items and fills a void no other device can.More Fun Apps:> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has changed its name to AccuWeather for Honeycomb. It's still the best weather app I found; the widget is great.> Days Left -- has a neat widget that goes on your desktop and can countdown the days to special events and occasions.> Amazon AppStore has a great app that makes it easy to shop for apps and get their Free App of the Day.> Airport Mania 2 -- has become one of my favorite games. Think Chevron Toy Cars with wings! The object is to land planes at your airport, wash, paint, load & unload packages and passengers, maintain and fuel up all the planes visiting your airport, and safely send them on their way. It's like being an Air Traffic Controller, but fun!> Word Mix -- a unique word scramble game that is addictive. You can play against the clock or Puzzle Mode.> WiFi Finder -- will find free WiFi Hot Spots in a Google Earth-type layout. It finds everything in your vicinity and maps it. Be sure to download the offline database within the app, so you can use it without a WiFi connection.> Rocket Bunnies -- If you read that title without a smile on your face, then you won't have any fun playing this game!> Prize Claw -- why waste money at a stupid machine, when you can play this for free! The teddy bears are cute, too!> Paradise Island -- think Sim City> Flying Penguin -- slide on your tummy, away from the polar bear, before he eats you up!> Fat Booth -- ever wonder what you'd look like chubby?! (or people you know or stars & celebrities)> Guinea Pig Getaway -- yes, it's as adorable as the title. Tilt and move your tablet to help guide their boat and escape the big meanie chasing them.> Foto Tiles Slideshow -- turn your desktop into a collage of personal photos that change on a timer; think digital mosaic, only it's a live desktop, not a screen saver.And last, but not least, I'd like to share a post written by Pie Grrrl, in the discussion section of this review - she had a VERY interesting conversation with some techies over at Best Buy, who gave their candid impressions about Thrive and other tablets. The direct link to her post is below. In brief, here's the just of what she learned:> All of them highly coveted the Thrive; the feel, the look and the full size ports.> All of them are gamers and mostly used their tablets at home; like I said in the review, these fill a void in everyone's home entertainment experience. Personally, I live in a bit of a bubble, and my Thrive has been a natural fit in my life and a conduit to the world. It's indispensable.> 20+ tablets coming out, including a newer, thinner Thrive.  Personally, I'm excited to see what Amazon's got up their sleeve with their upcoming new tab. I'm hoping for a slide-out keyboard, not that I'm in the market or could even afford to buy! I just like drooling over new tech.> Sales are tied between the Xoom and Thrive. The Xoomer's aren't interested in the ports; the Thriver's are.> the guys loved the Android platform vs. Apple's because they loved tinkering with the tablets and rooting them. Personally, rooting is nothing to be afraid of, and gives custom access and features to any Android tablet or phone. Just be aware it voids your warranty. I'll probably be rooting my Thrive once it's a little older.Looks like Amazon removed the link, so if you're interested, just look for Pie Grrrl's post in this review's discussion section: Posted on Sep 27, 2011 3:51:40 PM PDT.And lastly, and this time I mean it, a word about NetFlix -- I've cancelled my account, but some people have found a workaround until the official app is released. Point being, it will work, but just do a Google search, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of info. Having said that, Amazon VOD works perfectly, no tinkering required.BTW -- there's a post in this review's discussion thread, where on September 7, 2011 2:48:15 PM PDT -- where U. Shelat says explains how to get NetFlix working; As I no longer have NetFlix, I cannot verify if this works or not.Okay, I lied, I have to leave you with 1 last suggestion... get the Kindle app and read Jermaine Jackson's book about his brother Michael -- it's riveting. Yes, I have a review there, too. Love reading Kindle books on m Thrive. The book is called You Are Not Alone: Michael, Through a Brother's EyesThat's all for now, folks!Go forth all, and "Androidify" your Life!(Believe it or not, I didn't just coin that, it's actually an app):oDUPDATE 4 10-18-2011Had an interesting experience with an iPad today...Ran into someone who was trying to get photos transferred to their iPad -- they fumbled with hooking it up to their laptop, syncing to iTunes, then futzed another 30 minutes unable to make anything happen.  I just smiled.  Told the person how much I genuinely admire Mr. Jobs' genius, but wouldn't it be easier to just have onboard ports like on my Thrive -?- you'd be 30 seconds away from being done.  :oD>MORE GREAT APPS:>Webroot Security - FREE anti-virus, secure web browsing and rogue app scans.  Paid version includes ability to wipe a lost device clean on command.>Thumb Keyboard - Split your tablet's keyboard to the left and right corners of the screen -- makes typing and texting just as fast as a cell phone.>Circle Launcher - A nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line.>ADA Disabled Service Members - Free Americans With Disabilities Act info for Returning Service Members.Androidify all!:oDUPDATE 5 10-21-11Thrive just got an update adding Google Video support; basically movies on demand for a small fee. Between that, and Amazon VOD playing so well on Honeycomb and the Upcoming Kindle Fire, I'm beginning to think Netflix not working on Android Tabs is no accident. Either way, Netflix's time may well have come and gone, by their own doing as much as anything else.No word on Honeycomb 3.2, though at this point, I'm more interested in Ice Cream Sandwich! (Android 4.0) I saw a video and it looks yummy!  :o)UPDATE 6  10-24-11NETFLIX -- User ID "Visa Citi" just posted in the discussion thread for this review that NetFlix is now working. I downloaded the app, but was unable to log in, because I cancelled my NetFlix account several months back. I'm not interested in rejoining, but I checked another forum and confirmed that it is working.Android 3.2 -- is due shortly. And 3 weeks tardy in my humble opinion.Android 4.0 -- is the one we all want; no word on if or when.And it just goes without saying that I have to recommend more apps. Or as I like to call this portion of the review...KAIO'S ESSENTIAL ANDROID APPS:> AllRecipes.com Dinner Spinner -- Great recipe app.> Iris Alpha -- A prototype app that mimics Siri iPhone 4s.> Circle Launcher -- One of my new faves and recent Amazon Free App o' The Day -- Unclutter your desktop with this nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. The widget contracts to a small icon that, when touched, expands to display all the icons you've enclosed within it. Can be completely customized to your preferences.Th-th-that's all folks!Enjoy and Androidify!;^DUPDATE 7 - 11/27/2011Skype - is officially working. I don't use it myself but several users have verified it.Android 3.2 - click the Service Station icon to update.  No meaningful cosmetic changes; most likely bug fixes.  No word on when 4.0 will be ready.A word about memory, by Jeffrey Peterman:"If you look at the memory on the tablet, you'll find it split into 4:1. "Normal" internal memory, the same as the base memory on a phone.2. Internal SD memory, which is internal memory allocated for storage.3. External SD memory (an inserted microSD or SD, depending on the model.)4. USB memory.The system dynamically allocated memory between 1&2, without needing any user intervention, and this memory makes up the 8, 16, or 32 GB in the tablet. The other two "spaces" (inserted memory cards and USB memory) can ONLY be used for media storage - you can't run any program from an inserted card or a thumb drive, but you can open videos or documents that are on those removable spaces."Comment posted: Nov 27/11 3:30pmThanks JeffreyThe question about memory comes up a lot; how much to get?  Do I need 8, 16 or 32gb? To me, it's not a matter of the cost of a 32gb v.s. a 16gb + SDcard.  That comparison isn't equivalent, because having all the internal memory I need is far more valuable to me than an SDcard.  I'm not a fan of splitting critical and personal files that way.  I use my SDcard to float between several devices, but it always comes down to personal preference.Here's how it approximately breaks down:> an 8gb Thrive will have about 2.5gb available> a 16gb Thrive will have about 10gb available &> a 32gb Thrive will have about 25gb available.I've tried to write & update this review so it would answer an array of basic questions that come up often.  This is new technology to everyone, and it's the beginning of an exciting, new frontier.Androidify AllKaio:oDUPDATE 8 -- 3/17/2012Durability:  Well it's been 9 months with our Thrive, and still going strong.  The chrome finish near the camera is showing slight signs of wear.  And the lock on my SD card slot gave out just the other day.  It still reads SD cards, but I guess I'll have to tape them down, so the spring doesn't shoot it across the room.  Other than that, it's physically holding up quite well.Cool Volume Boost App: I found a cool app called Volume+ that boosts the audio up to 20X on the Thrive's speakers, and I even installed it on my new LG Marquee cell phone.  The app boosts the volume nicely on both devices, and can even boost bluetooth headsets and call volume as well.WiFi Tethering:  When I got my new cell phone I had to figure out all over again how to root it and configure the hotspot so I could tether my Thrive to it, but I got it working, and have a tutorial on how I did it posted on my blog.  Just check my Amazon profile for a link to my blog if you're interested, or check my post on March 7th in the Comments of this review for more details on tethering to a cell phone.Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich:  According to Toshiba's Twitter page, the Thrive will be getting this new version of Android by the end of Spring.  FINALLY!Android Green Back Cover:  I got the green back cover for my Thrive awhile back and it looks really cool.New Kid On The Block:  Toshiba Excite came out a couple of weeks back.  It's much thinner than the Thrive, so just decide if you need Thrive's ports and exchangeable battery.  If not, take a look at the Excite; it's currently the thinnest tablet on the market.More than likely this is my final update for the Thrive.  It's been fun seeing just how long this review can get, and how many comments we can all generate!!  Thanks to Everyone for all the fun.Keep Thriving & Androidify!;oDKaio... Still just visiting Earth!

 Length:: 9:19 MinsFrom initial reaction, the Thrive seems to be pretty standard in comparison with the Acer Iconia Acer Iconia Tab A500-10S16u 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Aluminum Metallic) that I had gotten for my dad.  It feels a little thicker and has more plastic overall as the whole back is a removable plate and the design looks a little better on the Iconia.  On the inside, both seem to be pretty responsive as expected running on the Honeycomb where both can be updated to 3.2 easily by going to the settings.  Included power adapter is a bit bigger and around the same size as that of my netbook for the Thrive while the Iconia one is more travel friendly and slightly smaller.Initial impressions of the overall build and the connections are positive and will see as time goes on how it holds up when my friend starts using it.Pros:Price was pretty decent over the lightning dealsFull sized SD cardUSB port and mini USB portMini HDMI Port for outputNice display from what I played withCons:3 ports are all on one side but may not be a big issueOverall plastic feeling which may or may not be a bad thing depending on casesVideo includes unbox, updates, and playing a little with the tablet.

For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia *UPDATE 8* Now Up:  See the addendum at the end of this review.I pre-ordered the 32gb Thrive here on Amazon, but got impatient and went to a local retailer just to check them out. We loved this tab so much, we got a 2nd for my husband in 16gb.Toshiba BrandFirst off -- No -- I do not work for Toshiba. But I fell in love with the brand a little over a year ago when I bought a new Qosmio laptop, and it's BY FAR the best computer I have ever owned.  I love it as much today as the day I got it, so when I found out Toshiba had an Android Tab, I had to take a serious look.Galaxy & Iconia in BriefPrior to learning about Thrive, I was seriously considering the new 10" Galaxy Tab.  I had been coveting the 8" model for some time, but just wasn't ready to take the leap.  So when the 10" came along, I just had to stop by a local retailer to try one out hands-on.  And I must say, I really fell in love with it -- the screen is vivid and stunning, the interface is clean and responsive.  And it's super thin for sure.  But, the first thing I noticed was there's no inputs of any kind; no SD slot, no USB, no nada.  The sales rep said that's because everything is trending toward the "cloud."  Well, that's all well and good, but I like products that I control, not products that control me (hence why I'm no fan of Apple's line of iShackle products.  I'm all for "the cloud" and have one here on Amazon for my music, but I'm also the type that prefers to have my own stuff stored locally.  I also like to get into the nuts and bolts of my peripherals and use them my way, so having no inputs on the Galaxy was a huge letdown for me.  I left the store feeling underwhelmed, and like it wasn't the right time to buy a tablet.  But I was bitten by the bug so I went home and started researching other tabs.Reviews here on Amazon had me convinced Acer Iconia was better than Asus Transformer.  And the Acer had USB inputs, so I was happy with that.  But I've never been a big fan of Acer, so I still wasn't feeling the itch just yet.  But then I stumbled upon the Toshiba Thrive, and still being so highly impressed with their laptop, I immediately felt a connection to the Thrive.Every Input I'll Ever NeedThrive has SD card, USB, mini-USB and full size HDMI ports.  And for me, this is where Thrive clobbers the competition -- Toshiba just "gets it;" they make products that keep the end user in control and offer a truly freeing experience.  I have a full size HDMI port on my Toshiba laptop too, and let me tell you, it completely changed my computing experience!  My laptop is connected to a 50" plasma TV and I use a wireless keyboard and gyration remote for a mouse.  Let me tell you, once you use a computer that way, there's just no going back.  So all those inputs on the Thrive was a big clincher for me -- and once again, Toshiba stands head and shoulders above the rest in this department.  I fully expect to connect my tablet to my HDTV as well.  And the on-board SD and USB ports assure I'll have all the computing freedom and control I've come to expect.Vibrant Screen and ColorWhen I first saw the Thrive at my local electronics store, I was a bit concerned the screen wasn't as vibrant as the Galaxy.  But then I remembered Thrive has an auto brightness feature, so I was wondering if that was limiting the saturation in some way.  I was easily able to find and navigate the setup menus right there in the store, turned off auto-brightness -- and voila! -- the Thrive's screen was every bit as vibrant and rich as the Galaxy!  The colors and clarity are nothing short of stunning.  I hate to say it, but the screen is probably better than my 50" plasma (it's only a couple years old, which already makes it a relic in tech world.)Ease of UseFor me, the truest test of any piece of tech, is the ability to use it straight out of the box with NO help from user manuals.  I got a new printer recently and had to fiddle with it for days because the install didn't set it up properly -- and in my book -- that's a sure sign of a piece of junk.  This Thrive, however, was very simple and easy to get the hang of within minutes right there in the store.  Naturally, that's as much a testament to Android 3.1 as it is to Toshiba Thrive.  Either way, I was doing everything from surfing the net, to customizing the entire interface and settings in minutes, all right there in the store -- no user manuals, no nothing.  I even tethered it to my cell phone just for fun.  The interface is so smooth and responsive, and the Tegra CPU is clearly a beast; no hangs, locking or delays of any kind.  Everything was fast, smooth and clean; just the way it should be.  In fact, Thrive loaded and buffered YouTube videos better than the Galaxy, though there could be many reasons for that given all the devices on the store's WiFi network.Rubberized BackSome might not think much of this, but believe me, it's pretty awesome and makes the Thrive feel like velvet in my hands!  It also gives me confidence in the tablet's durability and build quality.  By contrast, both the Galaxy and Iconia have a hard, slick back, and as a result, I personally found them both harder to hang on to.  I'm disabled and easily drop things, so I never felt fully confident holding either the Galaxy or Iconia.  All of these tabs are just a few weeks old, and it's worth pointing out that the backs of both the Galaxy and Iconia were scuffed and scratched to the point of making them look junky.  Granted, they're both display models in a high traffic store, but the physical condition of both these tabs after only a couple weeks on display suggests one can expect the same blemishes from personal use over time.  By contrast, the Thrive's rubber backing assures there'll be no scuffs or scratches on my tab or anything I set it down on.  And if it does wear out, I can just buy a new backing in one of 6 cool colors.ThicknessYes, the Thrive is probably twice as thick as the Galaxy, but I'm ok with that.  Especially since it isn't all that much heavier.  I think the added thickness is due to the USB and HDMI inputs the Galaxy is lacking.  Personally, I'd rather have a slightly thicker tab with all the inputs I want, than a wafer thin tab that has a USB dongle dangling from it that I always have to remember to carry.  Smaller and thinner isn't always better, at least not for my taste.  I don't want a 10" wafer thin screen that I'm scared to drop or set down anywhere, or that will easily get scratched or cracked.  The Galaxy just doesn't feel very durable, nor did the Iconia.  While the added thickness and rubberized back make the Thrive feel more durable; like it could survive being accidentally dropped, or if placed on a table, the rubber backing would help it survive minor spills.  Being disabled, I need something durable, and to that end, the Thrive feels like it will easily outlast both the Galaxy and Iconia.  And we're not talking a super thick tablet here; it's still plenty thin.  It's also very light; if not, my hands would cramp up and I wouldn't be able to grasp it to begin with.Wider Body - More To Get My Paws On!The Thrive is a bit wider than both the Galaxy and the Iconia -- the screen size is the same on all 3, but the Thrive's casing is about half an inch wider, which is great because it gives me a little more edge to hang on to without my fingers covering part of the screen.  I have big hands, so this all adds up to a good thing for me.  Overall, the Thrive just feels better in my hands, and more sturdy and durable.Screen ProtectorsI'm a fan of those "helicopter blade" screen protectors and have been using them on all my touch screen devices for years.  I went ahead and ordered a full body protector for my 32gb Thrive pre-order.  But after getting my hands on my husband's 16gb Thrive, I'm realizing I don't want to cover the velvety rubber back of my Thrive with a screen protector.  They haven't arrived yet, but I'm hoping we can use the back of the screen protector on the front of our 16gb Thrive (both pieces appear to be the same shape and size.  If not, no biggie, we'll just order another screen protector.  I'm a big believer in screen protection and they've saved me from accidental scratches more than once.Entertainment HubI've read that Tablets are trying to edge themselves into being the conduit that connects all your devices -- TV, cell phone, computer, etc.  And after getting this Thrive in my hands, I can see how tablets can easily fill that void.  I love my Qosmio laptop, but prefer not to take it away from home.  And my smartphone is great, but the screen is just too small to enjoy surfing the net on it.  But now with the Thrive, I can stay connected and still enjoy a full-fledged experience on the go, or even at home, all in the palm of my hands.  I've never been much into social networking, but I'm realizing that for someone with limited mobility, this might be my conduit to the outside world.  I can totally see how using this tab in a social aspect while watching TV would broaden and enhance my experience.  I just may get into Twitter too, and all that thanks to this Thrive!  Duh -- I'm starting to get why they named it that to begin with!Replaceable BatterySome people might find this meaningless.  But I just had to replace the battery in my expensive Harmony remote and it's only 2 years old.  So for me, having a replaceable battery in an expensive tablet its HUGE!  No other brand offers this but Thrive.Bottom Line -- my head is reeling a bit from the thought of owning 2 tablets.  It's really not an expense we can afford and I should probably cancel my 32gb pre-order here at Amazon or return this 16gb.  But we love it so much...  I guess we'll see what happens.  Either way, I really love this tablet and am VERY happy with it.  Every once in a while, a product comes along that fits my life like a glove.  Last time, it was Toshiba's Qosmio laptop.  This time, it's their Thrive tablet.  These are the first 2 Toshiba products I've owned, and I must say, I think Toshiba has won me over for life.  The quality, ease of use, superior construction and forward thinking innovation -- I'm sold; hands down.  There are plenty of tablets out there to choose from.  Just do your research and find the one that fits you.  For me, that's Toshiba Thrive.  I LOVE this tablet!!7/22/11 UPDATE -- Tips & Tricks:After using both 16gb and 32gb Thrive's for a couple weeks, I thought I'd add this addendum to my review:HDMI DUAL VIEWHook up the Thrive to your HDTV and the screen will display simultaneously on Thrive and your TV; Angry Birds on a 50" plasma - FUN!  I got a 25' HDMI cable, but am looking into wireless.  Picture is stunning.  BTW -- there's a reason why HDTVs _don't_ use mini or micro HDMI -- because the signal isn't as good as full-size HDMI, and only Thrive has that capability.DON'T USE A USB HUBI've had spotty results transferring files to Thrive when plugged into a hub.  But when I plug the Thrive directly into my laptop's USB port, I've had no issues and transfers are quite fast. (Win 7 Pro 64bit)FIREWALLS CAN BLOCK APPSI was initially having problems downloading apps from the Market while on my home WiFi, but then I realized my router's firewall was blocking some of Thrive's inbound traffic. So I set up 2 simple Port Forwarding rules, and voila, problem solved.BATTERY LIFEThrive charges in a about 1 hour; slightly longer if you're using it while charging.  So far, I've been getting 14-26 hours per charge while using Thrive on and off throughout the day.  My screen is set to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned off.  I leave WiFi on and just let Thrive go into sleep mode when not in use; naturally, the battery lasts even longer if I completely shut down at night.  Yesterday, I started the day with 50% battery life left -- I played Angry Birds for 4 hrs straight, watched YouTube for an hour, surfed the net and checked email for another hour, and read a book for 90min -- all that before the battery finally died and needed a recharge.  There's nothing scientific about my tally, but Thrive is giving me great battery life, IMO.ADOBE FLASH, FAST SURFING & PAGE LOADSSurfing the net is NOTHING like on my phone.  Web pages load as fast as my laptop and I can have several tabs open at the same time.  Fast, smooth and responsive.  Flash works great.  Haven't run into a website yet that doesn't work.EXTERNAL USB & FLASH DRIVESMake sure they are formatted with FAT (not NTFS) and you'll have no problems.  I even hooked up an external 500gb Western Digital My Passport drive with no issues.WHY 32gb IS BETTER THAN 16 or 8gbThrive comes pre-loaded with many apps; some useful, like Toshiba File Manager and Service Station; some not so useful, and they can't be deleted.  Point being -- I've never heard anyone complain about having too much HD space.  So do yourself a favor and get the largest GB you can afford.  SD cards, IMO, are for convenience, NOT for extending your storage capacity and running apps off it.  I use mine to view and transfer pics off my digital camera.FUN & HELPFUL APPS>Advanced WiFi Lock Free -- this solves the dreaded wake from sleep issue.  Go into the app's settings and UN-check "Enable Timeout."  Prior to this, I experienced the issue twice, but since installing this app, the wake from sleep issue has disappeared.  I do sometimes have to push the power button twice to get it to wake from sleep.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints about how the buttons work.>Talking Panda Free -- fun for kids of all ages!>Amazon Kindle -- read your digital books on Thrive.  Just wish it had text-to-speech.>DirecTV -- program your DVR(s) on the go and never miss a fave TV program.>Angry Birds -- I never thought I'd get into this game, but it really is fun.  Rio is my favorite edition.>Paint Joy -- finger painting on your tablet.  Save, share and even watch a time-lapsed rendition of your creations; kinda fun!  Let loose your inner artist!THRIVE PORTFOLIO CASEI got this case for outings away from home.  But at home, I prefer using Thrive without the case.  The Thrive is thicker than Galaxy, but I probably would have left Galaxy in it's case, because I didn't like how slick it felt.  So Thrive without a case is about the same thickness as with Galaxy with a case.ENTERTAINMENT CENTERThrive has already become another component of my home entertainment system.  I use it simultaneously while watching TV or even surfing the net on my laptop, which is hooked up to my 50" plasma.  The Thrive has become an addition and a natural extension of my home entertainment center.That's it for now; I'll add more in time, if I think of anything.9/5/2011 UPDATE 2 - over 2 months and still loving my Thrive.  Here's a couple extra helpful tips:HDTV VIA THRIVEWe took our Thrive on vacation with us for our anniversary (happy 21st to us!) and hooked it up to the hotel's 42" HDTV.  Thanks to Thrive's full-sized HDMI port, we easily ran a 25' cable right to our bed and watched our fave TV shows right off the TV network's websites while connected to the hotel's free WiFi.THRIVE DOCKDo yourself a favor and get one if the expense fits your budget. It's a tad overpriced at $50 with no power supply (it uses the one that came with Thrive) but it doubles as a great lap stand and makes charging the Thrive much more convenient; just slip it in and out of the cradle.  Don't like how the adapter fits into the Thrive itself and the dock solves that problem.  Also, Thrive looks great on display in the dock too.  I suppose if you don't mind changing the screen timeout a lot, you could even use it as a digital picture frame (just be careful with that if running off the battery.  I have a review for the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI too if you're interested.PORT FORWARDINGI was going to post specifics in my last update, but thought it might be different for everyone and didn't want to misinform.  But in case it helps anyone, here's how I fixed the problem I had with downloading apps from the Market on my home WiFi:I have my router's firewall set to high, and when I played around with the different security levels, I noticed the 2 that were blocking my Thrive were Real A/V port 7070 and T120 port 1503. I set 2 specific rules and opened those ports for my Thrive, and then the Market apps downloaded without issue. (these were both inbound traffic.  You have to know a little about port forwarding for this to make sense, but it's not that hard to do; a quick Google search never hurts. :-)MORE GREAT APPS> Scrabble is interesting because you can play online over time. I have 30 games going any given week. The app is a bit buggy, but it's still fun and I'm sure they'll improve on it.> Documents To Go is half off @ $7.99 in the Amazon AppStore> Twitter - works well but I'm still learning and don't tweet much, mostly follow.> Gmail comes standard with the tab. GDocs and all of Google's stuff is awesome.> GOOGLE SKY helped us find Jupiter, Mars, all the planets and stars in our solar system last night!! CQQL!!> The Kroger app lets me add digital coupons to my grocery store club card.> DirecTV Remote controls my TV's DVR; kinda neat.> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has a neat widget where you can flick up or down to change the temperature amongst your saved locations> Cloudy is a fun paper airplane game> PhotoShop Express is free and always good to have.> MXvideo Player has neat swipe controls that make it easy to forward, pause and reverse vids while they are playing.> the Bookmarks widget that comes standard with the tab lets you scroll through thumbnails of each web page.> Vevo and TV.com apps have some good content> Fruit Ninja is surprisingly fun; I like Zen Mode.  It speaks to my inner samurai.> and don't forget my all time fave: Lily The Talking Panda> All of these apps have free versions; the only one I've paid for so far is Paint Joy Pro at $1.99.> & Remember - 1 FREE PAID APP A DAY here on Amazon!That's all for now folks!;oDUPDATE 3 - 9/27/2011Over 3 months and I still L-O-V-E my Thrive!  It's a cornerstone of my entertainment experience. I do take it with me when I venture out, but home is my primary use. It is ALWAYS in my lap. Instant fit in my life and fills a void no other device can.  Perfect!Here's the latest Helpful Tips I'd like to share:Project Your ThriveI recently discovered that Thrive can be hooked up to an Epson Projector, which can be invaluable for those doing business presentations. Just plug in a standard HDMI cable from Thrive to the projector, and it will project your Android tablet onto any surface. Sure, you could do this with another tab, and HDMI dongle, or micro connection, but I never like being caught in the lurch with nonstandard cables. I've been caught more than once with a proprietary cable that's failed. I much prefer the convenience and reliability of Thrive's full size onboard ports. I have a review for the Epson Multimedia Projector on that page as well.Tablets Are Touchy-FeelyFor me, a tablet is a tactile experience, hence, external keyboards and mice are not required.  I've tried them both and found them counterintuitive.  If I want to use those things, I've got a great laptop for that.  A tablet is a device that stands on its own like no other.  It is a personal item, hence, it should feel good to hold.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not a computer.  It doesn't play by the same rules.  Quite simply, it's the most personal and indispensable component of all my tech items and fills a void no other device can.More Fun Apps:> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has changed its name to AccuWeather for Honeycomb. It's still the best weather app I found; the widget is great.> Days Left -- has a neat widget that goes on your desktop and can countdown the days to special events and occasions.> Amazon AppStore has a great app that makes it easy to shop for apps and get their Free App of the Day.> Airport Mania 2 -- has become one of my favorite games. Think Chevron Toy Cars with wings! The object is to land planes at your airport, wash, paint, load & unload packages and passengers, maintain and fuel up all the planes visiting your airport, and safely send them on their way. It's like being an Air Traffic Controller, but fun!> Word Mix -- a unique word scramble game that is addictive. You can play against the clock or Puzzle Mode.> WiFi Finder -- will find free WiFi Hot Spots in a Google Earth-type layout. It finds everything in your vicinity and maps it. Be sure to download the offline database within the app, so you can use it without a WiFi connection.> Rocket Bunnies -- If you read that title without a smile on your face, then you won't have any fun playing this game!> Prize Claw -- why waste money at a stupid machine, when you can play this for free! The teddy bears are cute, too!> Paradise Island -- think Sim City> Flying Penguin -- slide on your tummy, away from the polar bear, before he eats you up!> Fat Booth -- ever wonder what you'd look like chubby?! (or people you know or stars & celebrities)> Guinea Pig Getaway -- yes, it's as adorable as the title. Tilt and move your tablet to help guide their boat and escape the big meanie chasing them.> Foto Tiles Slideshow -- turn your desktop into a collage of personal photos that change on a timer; think digital mosaic, only it's a live desktop, not a screen saver.And last, but not least, I'd like to share a post written by Pie Grrrl, in the discussion section of this review - she had a VERY interesting conversation with some techies over at Best Buy, who gave their candid impressions about Thrive and other tablets. The direct link to her post is below. In brief, here's the just of what she learned:> All of them highly coveted the Thrive; the feel, the look and the full size ports.> All of them are gamers and mostly used their tablets at home; like I said in the review, these fill a void in everyone's home entertainment experience. Personally, I live in a bit of a bubble, and my Thrive has been a natural fit in my life and a conduit to the world. It's indispensable.> 20+ tablets coming out, including a newer, thinner Thrive.  Personally, I'm excited to see what Amazon's got up their sleeve with their upcoming new tab. I'm hoping for a slide-out keyboard, not that I'm in the market or could even afford to buy! I just like drooling over new tech.> Sales are tied between the Xoom and Thrive. The Xoomer's aren't interested in the ports; the Thriver's are.> the guys loved the Android platform vs. Apple's because they loved tinkering with the tablets and rooting them. Personally, rooting is nothing to be afraid of, and gives custom access and features to any Android tablet or phone. Just be aware it voids your warranty. I'll probably be rooting my Thrive once it's a little older.Looks like Amazon removed the link, so if you're interested, just look for Pie Grrrl's post in this review's discussion section: Posted on Sep 27, 2011 3:51:40 PM PDT.And lastly, and this time I mean it, a word about NetFlix -- I've cancelled my account, but some people have found a workaround until the official app is released. Point being, it will work, but just do a Google search, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of info. Having said that, Amazon VOD works perfectly, no tinkering required.BTW -- there's a post in this review's discussion thread, where on September 7, 2011 2:48:15 PM PDT -- where U. Shelat says explains how to get NetFlix working; As I no longer have NetFlix, I cannot verify if this works or not.Okay, I lied, I have to leave you with 1 last suggestion... get the Kindle app and read Jermaine Jackson's book about his brother Michael -- it's riveting. Yes, I have a review there, too. Love reading Kindle books on m Thrive. The book is called You Are Not Alone: Michael, Through a Brother's EyesThat's all for now, folks!Go forth all, and "Androidify" your Life!(Believe it or not, I didn't just coin that, it's actually an app):oDUPDATE 4 10-18-2011Had an interesting experience with an iPad today...Ran into someone who was trying to get photos transferred to their iPad -- they fumbled with hooking it up to their laptop, syncing to iTunes, then futzed another 30 minutes unable to make anything happen.  I just smiled.  Told the person how much I genuinely admire Mr. Jobs' genius, but wouldn't it be easier to just have onboard ports like on my Thrive -?- you'd be 30 seconds away from being done.  :oD>MORE GREAT APPS:>Webroot Security - FREE anti-virus, secure web browsing and rogue app scans.  Paid version includes ability to wipe a lost device clean on command.>Thumb Keyboard - Split your tablet's keyboard to the left and right corners of the screen -- makes typing and texting just as fast as a cell phone.>Circle Launcher - A nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line.>ADA Disabled Service Members - Free Americans With Disabilities Act info for Returning Service Members.Androidify all!:oDUPDATE 5 10-21-11Thrive just got an update adding Google Video support; basically movies on demand for a small fee. Between that, and Amazon VOD playing so well on Honeycomb and the Upcoming Kindle Fire, I'm beginning to think Netflix not working on Android Tabs is no accident. Either way, Netflix's time may well have come and gone, by their own doing as much as anything else.No word on Honeycomb 3.2, though at this point, I'm more interested in Ice Cream Sandwich! (Android 4.0) I saw a video and it looks yummy!  :o)UPDATE 6  10-24-11NETFLIX -- User ID "Visa Citi" just posted in the discussion thread for this review that NetFlix is now working. I downloaded the app, but was unable to log in, because I cancelled my NetFlix account several months back. I'm not interested in rejoining, but I checked another forum and confirmed that it is working.Android 3.2 -- is due shortly. And 3 weeks tardy in my humble opinion.Android 4.0 -- is the one we all want; no word on if or when.And it just goes without saying that I have to recommend more apps. Or as I like to call this portion of the review...KAIO'S ESSENTIAL ANDROID APPS:> AllRecipes.com Dinner Spinner -- Great recipe app.> Iris Alpha -- A prototype app that mimics Siri iPhone 4s.> Circle Launcher -- One of my new faves and recent Amazon Free App o' The Day -- Unclutter your desktop with this nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. The widget contracts to a small icon that, when touched, expands to display all the icons you've enclosed within it. Can be completely customized to your preferences.Th-th-that's all folks!Enjoy and Androidify!;^DUPDATE 7 - 11/27/2011Skype - is officially working. I don't use it myself but several users have verified it.Android 3.2 - click the Service Station icon to update.  No meaningful cosmetic changes; most likely bug fixes.  No word on when 4.0 will be ready.A word about memory, by Jeffrey Peterman:"If you look at the memory on the tablet, you'll find it split into 4:1. "Normal" internal memory, the same as the base memory on a phone.2. Internal SD memory, which is internal memory allocated for storage.3. External SD memory (an inserted microSD or SD, depending on the model.)4. USB memory.The system dynamically allocated memory between 1&2, without needing any user intervention, and this memory makes up the 8, 16, or 32 GB in the tablet. The other two "spaces" (inserted memory cards and USB memory) can ONLY be used for media storage - you can't run any program from an inserted card or a thumb drive, but you can open videos or documents that are on those removable spaces."Comment posted: Nov 27/11 3:30pmThanks JeffreyThe question about memory comes up a lot; how much to get?  Do I need 8, 16 or 32gb? To me, it's not a matter of the cost of a 32gb v.s. a 16gb + SDcard.  That comparison isn't equivalent, because having all the internal memory I need is far more valuable to me than an SDcard.  I'm not a fan of splitting critical and personal files that way.  I use my SDcard to float between several devices, but it always comes down to personal preference.Here's how it approximately breaks down:> an 8gb Thrive will have about 2.5gb available> a 16gb Thrive will have about 10gb available &> a 32gb Thrive will have about 25gb available.I've tried to write & update this review so it would answer an array of basic questions that come up often.  This is new technology to everyone, and it's the beginning of an exciting, new frontier.Androidify AllKaio:oDUPDATE 8 -- 3/17/2012Durability:  Well it's been 9 months with our Thrive, and still going strong.  The chrome finish near the camera is showing slight signs of wear.  And the lock on my SD card slot gave out just the other day.  It still reads SD cards, but I guess I'll have to tape them down, so the spring doesn't shoot it across the room.  Other than that, it's physically holding up quite well.Cool Volume Boost App: I found a cool app called Volume+ that boosts the audio up to 20X on the Thrive's speakers, and I even installed it on my new LG Marquee cell phone.  The app boosts the volume nicely on both devices, and can even boost bluetooth headsets and call volume as well.WiFi Tethering:  When I got my new cell phone I had to figure out all over again how to root it and configure the hotspot so I could tether my Thrive to it, but I got it working, and have a tutorial on how I did it posted on my blog.  Just check my Amazon profile for a link to my blog if you're interested, or check my post on March 7th in the Comments of this review for more details on tethering to a cell phone.Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich:  According to Toshiba's Twitter page, the Thrive will be getting this new version of Android by the end of Spring.  FINALLY!Android Green Back Cover:  I got the green back cover for my Thrive awhile back and it looks really cool.New Kid On The Block:  Toshiba Excite came out a couple of weeks back.  It's much thinner than the Thrive, so just decide if you need Thrive's ports and exchangeable battery.  If not, take a look at the Excite; it's currently the thinnest tablet on the market.More than likely this is my final update for the Thrive.  It's been fun seeing just how long this review can get, and how many comments we can all generate!!  Thanks to Everyone for all the fun.Keep Thriving & Androidify!;oDKaio... Still just visiting Earth!

Good enough for me. I purchased my first Latte product, Latte Ice Smart, three months ago.  First of all, Latte Ice Smart is small enough for me to carry it around.Once I had an issue and sent an email to Latte.  Latte was very responsive to my question and resolve my issue in no time.I highly recommend Latte Ice Smart for those who want to have it carried around in their pocket.  Furthermore, It also have full android functions like a smart phone.

Better than expected from long-time user! My review from another tech website, so do not be alarmed if you see it elsewhere... it's me! :)PROS1. Great form factor. A 7 inch tablet is just as important as a 10 in. tablet.2. Convenient to surf the web, watch Netflix or quickly check Facebook.3. Once the Android Market is acquired, games and other applications are easy to install.4. Up to 32 MicroSD addition.5. Capacitive Touchscreen!!!6. Charges quickly, usually less than 30 minutes-1 hour for full battery!7. My 3 year old daughter uses it effortlessly.8. Android 2.3CONS1. Battery Life is not short, but could be longer and really depends on what you are doing (e.g. Video will drain quicker than surfing the web). But I am still able to watch a full 3-4 hours of straight video.2. Only one speaker, but no big deal for me I add a speaker through the headphone jack, whenever I want it louder. I use the Coby when I take showers, sound is excellent and no need for anything louder. The newer Coby's have more speakers if you have the need.3. Unable to add newer Android OS unless you "Jailbreak" it.I normally do not write reviews, but was tired of reading people's poor reviews of this product and having had the product for almost a year I felt it was reasonable for me to write a review. Unfortunately, it may be too difficult for a few users, but it is not hard to add the most important part to a harmonious tablet experience, adding the Android Market. Once the Android Market is in place it is easy to check Facebook (unlike another commenter mentioned).Check YouTube on how to put the Android Market on the Coby Kyros. Join the AndroidTablets.net forum to learn more about your device.Yes, I watch Netflix on my device. I am using Netflix version 1.5.0 Build 360 and it works!Others have mentioned poor Wi-Fi. I am using a Linsky G-router with WiMax internet and by no means the newest router such as "N" and/or the fastest internet via "Cable" or "Fios". No problems. Add "Advanced Wi-Fi Lock Free", a free application from the Android Market and I have never lost a connection albeit I live in a small home of 1550 sq. ft.Other applications to add to your Coby should be "Cache Cleaner" and "Super Task Killer".Now for other useful software. I use the Opera Mini Browser for quickly checking Facebook, Ebay, Amazon, etc.. and Dolphin HD Browser for reading my web journals/magazines like Wired.com. SkyFire Browser may be suited to others preferences.Download a Youtube application for watching Youtube from your Youtube account subscriptions.I also can watch ESPN3 on the tablet, although rendering is not the best at times and may be due to my internet for streaming. When I watch "Replay" ESPN games, rendering is better.I also use Pandora, TuneIn and Shazaam for tunes.I use the Nook reader for ebooks or epubs.Games and other applications are limitless like Angry Birds and some coloring games like PicsArt for my child. I also have a Star Trek Soundboard to alert me whenever there is a new email... Love it!Anyway, the Coby Kyros fits my needs and is by no means an iPad or mid-range priced tablet. What it is though is an excellent first tablet with a small learning curve and once everything is in place... you can't lose for the $100 tablet arena of the Coby Kyros 7022.Just as a Footnote: I am a longtime Apple user; having owned a iMac G3, iMac G5, Macbook Pro and a Mac Mini. Apple is losing the 7-inch market and people do like using smaller tablets like myself. Android is a suitable and a well developed ecosystem. Thank you Coby for developing the Kyros and for providing an affordable tablet that fits my needs!UPDATE 3/20/12: I had my beloved Coby Kyros 7022 lock up on me.  The screen freezes and then restarts.  Fortunately, customer service was able to help me do a factory reset by doing the following:1. Have Coby Kyros unplugged.2. Hold simultaneously the Power button and the Silver-Front button, until you see an Android Logo.3. Count to 15 seconds, then press the Silver-Front button once more.4. This brings up the "Android System Recovery", using the top "Home/Menu" button, select "Wipe Data".Fortunately, I had all my applications saved on my computer and/or the Mirco-SD card.  I then re-added the Market.  It was frustrating not have any good piece of tech work, but thanks to the Coby Customer Service, I am back on track.  Lastly, it did take about 30 minutes to get Customer Service, but they were very helpful and courteous.

OK tablet, Great pen This is the first tablet I have owned, however I have had the opportunity to play with several other tablets for short periods.My impression of the Thinkpad is that it is a good tablet let down by lots of small annoyances. Overall I am not sorry I own it, and I do enjoy using it. However if I didn't need the pen I would be happier with the Asus transformer, or and iPad (although I personally dislike apple products).Pro's:-The stylus is really the big advantage of this tablet. It has much higher resolution than the finger input or capacitive styluses you can buy for other tablets.  I work in Academia, and I use this tablet to read and mark up scientific papers and text books in pdf format with the Repligo program from the market. I can highlight, make text boxes, and draw freehand with relative ease using the pen. In this capacity the Thinkpad is frankly excellent, and there are no other tablets with the same capabilities.-Another thing I like is a physical button to prevent the screen from rotating when you rotate the tablet. This is very handy if you want to keep an article in portrait mode while reading.-Full sized USB port, with support for thumbsticks. Lenovo has included an app to help transfer files back and forth from thumbsticks that you plug into the tablet. You must use the app to transfer files, since Android doesn't have a file browser that will let you do it. This app is nice and simple and seems to work well. The only downside is that a Keyboard-Folio will use up this port, so you can't have a thumbstick and a keyboard plugged in at the same time.-The wifi on the tablet seems to work well. I have connected to open and password secured networks, and the tablet can connect and use the internet nicely.-the full sized USB port has a sliding cover to keep out lint and dust from your bag. I really like this feature since i have had some ports on a laptop get full of crud and need cleaning out with a toothpick.Con's:-At times the tablet can feel sluggish. Some basic functions like switching pages in the pre-installed notes app take much too long to complete. switching from one app to the next can be irritatingly slow.-The capacitive input for your finger sometimes feels insensitive, although this may just be the tablet taking a long time to respond to input.-The tablet comes pre-loaded with Lenovo's social networking application "Social Touch", and a bunch of other social and media consumption apps, and games. This is frankly very irritating. This tablet is advertized as a business ready tablet, and I don't need Lenovo's half baked attempt to integrate facebook, twitter and email into one app. Even more irritating, this "Social Touch" app cannot be uninstalled. (Most of the other apps can be removed)-For some reason Lenovo has also re-created several of the apps that are part of Android, so the tablet comes with two Gallery apps, two mail apps, two calendar apps etc. The only plus side of this is that you can uninstall.-Lenovo has also tweaked the basic Honeycomb interface to include a favorite apps button on the system bar. This is not a bad idea except that the Android interface already has a link to all the apps currently running, which is very similar in practice. I find that I don't really need both of these and I frequently tap one when I want the other. I personally feel lenovo would be better off using just the basic Android interface for this tablet.-There is a faint grid on the screen. I assume this is a part of the stylus digitization system, and it is usually unobtrusive, however, in a well lit room, with a dark screen this can be distracting.-Charging this tablet is a problem: the charging uses the tablets mini usb port and a special adaptor plug. While the screen is on the tablet draws power so fast that charging barely happens: I have watched the charge go up by 1% every 10min or so while I was using the tablet. If you plug the tablet into a computer, the screen will draw more power than the computer can provide, so the tablet will still be discharging the battery. Due to these issues, the only real way to recharge the battery is to stop using the tablet and let it recharge. When the screen is off the tablet does recharge in an acceptable time, but I would really like to have a more capable charging system.-My tablet does not have the 3g option. This makes the GPS mostly useless for directions. Google maps requires a data connection to download maps and update routs. Without 3g, you can't do this on the road. This isn't a big problem since most of us have a phone with gps and a data connection, and if you get a thinkpad with a 3g connection there is no problem at all, but it is one more thing the tablet can't always do.-This tablet has a set of hardware keys for home, back, and web. The android system maintains the system bar with the software keys all the time since it was designed for tablets without these hardware keys. Since I have the software keys I rarely use the Hardware keys intentionally. I do occasionally press them accidentally when I am gripping the tablet which can be frustrating. Since these keys are duplicated in the software interface I would prefer not to have them.-The opening for the pen and the full size USB port have fairly sharp edges, which can make it uncomfortable to hold the tablet in one hand while working. This is made more frustrating by the fact that these ports are on the 'bottom' edge of the tablet (I am defining bottom here by the orientation that the keyboard folio keeps the tablet). Flipping the tablet over is not terribly hard and solves this issue, but I still find it a poor design.-The speaker on this tablet is poor. You can hear it in a quiet environment but it is easily overwhelmed by ambient noise. Further the sound is tinny and not great for music. This is not a problem if you have earbuds/headphones plugged in-The microphone is terrible. One of the nice features on my android pone has always been the voice recognition capabilities (I had nice voice integration 2 years before apple's siri). This tablet NEVER gets a voice command correct, while my pone gets it right 95% of the time or better. I haven't tried skype or other video chat apps, but I imagine the sound quality will be pretty bad.Other Thoughts:-Battery life is OK but not great. If I turn off wifi and don't do anything really CPU heavy like play a 3d game, I can get 7-9hours actual use out of a charge. With wifi on, I get 6 or so, and if I'm using a lot of download and cpu, like viewing youtube videos I probably get 4-5 hours of real use time. As far as I know there is no option for an external battery to increase the tablets usable time (The asus transformer for instance has an extra battery in the Keyboard-folio, but the thinkpad does not), but I find that I rarely use the tablet for more than 5 hours a day.-If you intend to hack the tablet with root access and try to streamline things a bit, keep in mind that the current root-access hack does not work for a noteworthy percentage of these tablets, including mine.To wrap up, I do want to say that the issues I listed above sound very irritating when written down, but I don't find them that frustrating in practice. I am happy with the tablet, and the sluggishness I reported is really not bad enough to impact the function of the tablet. The pen input is fantastic, and I find myself using it all the time, even when my finger would probably work just as well. If you have a use scenario where a pen input would be helpful, this is certainly a very good tablet. If you are interested in something for play (email, web browsing, games and video) I think that many of the other offerings have better polish and a nicer overall user experience.

Marvelous! This pad has everything I want, the USB is a plus. The only thing I don't like is sometimes when I  am online the program is automatically shut down, not often but it happens. Overall I would not trade it for  any other pad

The best tablet out there and can only get better....hopefully with next software update UPDATE AFTER ALMOST 5 MONTHS OF USEWith the latest Sony firmware update (middle of December) and after extensive testing, all battery drain issues have disappeared. it is now on a par, if not better, at keeping charge in standby mode, than any other tablet apart from the IPAD. Also I have remedied the wi-fi connection issue, but had to upgrade my cable HISPEED internet-now paying about $60.00 per month. The Sony S Tablet id not play nice with my former speeds-though 3-4 MBPS is not exactly slow. Now that I have almost doubled or tripled this, I do not get ANY dropped wifi connections after 2 minutes. I do have to say that my reason for changing to a more expensive internet plan was affected by my girlfriend's two teen boys who have a voracious online gaming habits of course (don't they all now?) Otherwise I would not have upgraded. I must mention, that this is more a recent development, and my previous testing of the wifi connection was done sans teenagers. Because of this I can still only give it 4 stars. I am very disappointed that there has not been more integration with the Playstaion store and more games available. I am also disappointed in the limited usability of the SD card. No matter which file browser is used it ids a pain in the rear to load and transfer movies to free up space in main tablet storage. Also, no matter what, finding the movies is an issue since the ones stored on the SD card do NOT show up in Sony's video application along with other videos purchased from Sony Video Unlimited. I have yet to find a File viewer that can show the files on the sd card and tablet in one view, from which you can also seamlessly play all files and have all the other features of regular video players that most other tablets have-recognizing and showing the movie names that I established for my ripped files on the desktop. Transferring video files to the sd card should not require me to transfer and then delete the original file from the Tablet. Transfer should mean just that-not copy instead. for that reason I  upgrade my review 3.5 stars stars(if i could give half stars), since these problems still exist, though there have been improvements such as battery life.UPDATE AFTER 1 MONTH OF USE: (PREVIOUS POSITIVE BATTERY LIFE COMMENTS FROM INITIAL REVIEW HAVE NOT HELD UP)Due to the severe battery drain when on standby, I have stopped using this device for the time being. I am going to wait until a software update comes out to solve this issue, and until the Official Skinny Case from Sony arrives. That way I do not have to remove the tablet from a pouch and not worry that the battery will be down to 20 % after 8 hours of standby and with only 4 hours of use(reading, browsing and playing Fish Tycoon). My new Galaxy Tab 8.9 has a  M-Edge case that does this and gives me 60% battery life at the end of the day(under the same usage) rather than just 20%-big difference. I love the heft and feel of the Sony, but cannot justify using it because of the battery drain issue. My initial review of battery life was good, but having installed exactly the same apps as on my other test tablets, the battery life and drain have worsened significantly. It is definitely something specific to the Sony Tablet/software.I am also somewhat pessimistic now, since Sony has delayed shipping on the case 6 times in 6 weeks. Also, as of now there is no news on a Software update release. That's fairly understandable though, since the tablet is still within 60 days of initial release. I would definitely NOT recommend this tablet to anyone who is going to be out and about-not unless you completely switch it off each time. This becomes annoying, since the Sony is not the fastest tablet to boot up. Oh and another annoying thing, is that any video which you transfer to the Tab, skips and stutters when screen orientation is changed. If you are just going to use this to browse the web and read ebooks-and are willing to shut the tablet down completely after each use, then this is the best tablet out there. IMHO however if you can wait a couple of months to see how Sony handles these issues with a software update, then go ahead. Sony has the potential to be the best tablet period(unless you like having hundreds of thousands of useless apps,no decent way to organize or close them, no widgets, no true multitasking and being tied into a proprietary ecosystem that makes converting movies a nightmare if virtually impracticable with lousy music and video quality).UPDATE AFTER 2 WEEKS WORTH OF USE:I regrettably have to drop my rating to 3 stars from 5. This is not just because the Video Unlimited or Music Unlimited apps are not ready or working properly-the Sony is new and that is expected. The problem I am seeing, and which other colleagues are experiencing, is severe battery drain when left on standby.About 3% drain per hour. This is unacceptable when not in use. It should not be happening since the specs are pretty identical to other similar Tegra driven tablets, so it most be a software leak. Where, I cannot say exactly, but bearing in mind that Sony has included dozens of proprietary programs, not on other tablets, including Crash Bandicoot and Pinball, as well as the Sony Video and Reader Apps, then I have to say that some of these may be poorly coded for the tablet, causing a battery drain, even when the programs are supposedly shut down. This CAN be fixed with a software update however. The other issue I have had is streaming and downloading of video. It just times out after about a couple of minutes and I have to keep refreshing the download-what should be a 45 min download can take hours as a result. Forget about streaming a movie of course. Before anyone says it is my wifi connection-since I have an abundance of various tablets at any given time, I know this issue is not specific to my wifi connection of course. I did contact Sony Customer support, but their only advice was to do what I already had, factory reset and update Adobe Flash. Again, I think that this issue could also be fixed with a software upgrade, but that had better happen very quickly, or else folks have many other avenues where they can channel hard earned cash. Especially in the next couple of months. I hope I can come back to you soon and go back to a 5 star rating. Sony, are you listening?UPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF INTENSIVE USE:Still a great device. I have been trying out the video and movie applications. The best way to play video is definitely through the gallery function. Though the movie files are not fully labeled as they would be in a custom Video Playing app, the files run smoothly and transition well when orientation changes. Using the built in video player...that needs some work-it is great until you decide to switch orientation or move the device by accident-then it either freezes or you have to restart. Not a dealbreaker since I know that the Video app will be updated.Crackle..free movies etc....sucks and I reported it...my wifi connection is broadband based and great for any other device, but not good for watching movies. It is another free app so i do not feel as though I am losing out too much, especially since i never planned to watch feature length movies streaming from wifi.Too much battery drain for ANY device, and they, of course, cannot let you download. Sony's Video Unlimited Store-which is not up and running as of yesterday yet-had better be a lot more wifi friendly for downloading. That is an interesting topic actually, since my HTC Flyer with the HTC Movie store(very limited on choice though) can be set to not have the screen go to sleep, then downloads are not interrupted with wifi cutting out-just leave it plugged in overnight is all. The Sony Tablet does not give you an option for"never turn screen off': just keep on for max of 30 mins. That is not good if the Sony Unlimited Video store app cannot download content if screen goes to sleep. That really would be an issue. Of course you could hook up to the laptop/desktop via a micro usb(provide your own) and download from saved files on your computer....However you have to download from the Sony site first then wait and then download to the tablet. So I much prefer the other option directly to tablet. We will see if Sony respond to this issue rapidly. The Sony Bookstore is great, let us see if the Video and Music Store, when fully operational, can match it.Apart from that no other issues of note: The Playstation games-pinball and Bandicoot are superb...cannot wait for the full Playstation experience and access to thousands, or at least hundreds of other titles initially! Also, cannot wait to get a proper portfolio case, so I can make the device more portable....really guys...don't spend 70 or 100 bucks on the Sony leather slip pouch...not worth it trust me. Just go for a generic tablet pouch for 10 bucks or so, until the STM Skinny for Sony Tablet S comes out-custom case so you can use/charge while protecting etc. It's a $500 piece of kit, so I do not want to keep taking it out of a case all the time to use it. You cannot get an Amazon yet, so order from the Sony Store-back ordered and mine will ship on the 14th of Oct...hopefully. Will keep you posted on developments!INITIAL IMPRESSIONS AFTER 2-3 DAYSI test tablets and write about them as a hobby. The money, from the reviews I write, pretty much indulges my geeky hobby.I currently own 10 different tablets and have just sold 4 this year. These 14 tablets cover virtually every reputable tablet out there. Creative Ziio,Samsung 7 and 10 inch, Acer 7 and 10 inch, iPad 1 and 2,HTC Flyer Toshiba Thrive(weighs a tonne), Motorola Zoom(given to my GF),HP Touchpad, Vizio 8 inch, Blackberry Playbook and now the Sony S Tablet. Asus Transformer just was a pointless proposition since I was not interested in a full keyboard-just Tablets and Portability.Same thing goes for the Slider really.I look for portability,battery life, raw power,great screen,great layout/icons, compatability with Video/audio codecs reliability, great cases and accessories,sturdiness, large # of apps and a decent price bearing these attributes in mind.Apple has battery life, raw power, sturdiness, large number of apps, great accessories and a decent price.It has awful screen resolution,video looks crappy on it when compared to others. Proprietary formatting through iTunes. iTunes itself is great for the masses, but not if you want things your way. Cannot even have your icons where you want them on your screen and space them conveniently! horrible sound quality through speakers as well-low volume output. It does have every App known to man on it however and you can watch any video ever made on it. The quality and sound, for those of us who actually notice and care, is horrible.The Acer 7 inch has a horrible battery life,spotty wi-fi connection, few case options but everything else is really great.the Thrive has a lot going for it, but seriously it weighs a tonne and not that great looking either. Screen is not that fantastic compared to others too. Decent price though.The Vizio...is unfinished, but a great eBook reader-better than Nook Color and will rival anything that the Kindle eggheads will come up with...unless Amazon can design a better color screen version,max out battery life to about 20 hours and price it for $250 or under. i am pretty sure this will happen in the next 2 months or so.The HTC Flyer is the best 7 inch in my opinion since it can do pretty much everything and has really good battery life. The other closest 7 inch is the Galaxy tab-both pretty comparable, but i find Flyer gives me better battery life for reading and browsing-which is pretty much what I do on a 7 inch tablet.The playbook-well it has the potential to be the best of them all...but RIM has just messed this product up and even with the 2.0 OS being promised forever, I think that the ship has sailed. IF they do bring out 2.0 and Android market compatability with native email-then it will be the best portable tablet out there. Until then........Sony,has it just right with even greater potential for the future.The Sony S tablet is the only tablet that you can hold in your hands, even one handed and browse for hours as you could a paperback. Only you can do one heck of a lot more with this Android tablet than a paperback....Sony got the right sized tablet for browsing AND playing Playstation games. Screen quality is great and so is the battery life. You feel you are holding a 7 inch tablet when in fact you are holding one about 40% bigger. The ergonomically weighted design is a genius of an idea.  The screen icons look 10 times better than the regular Android icons and the battery life rivals the ipad quite easily. Close enough and within 10% anyway. I will take that for fantastic video and sound quality in exchange..Other reviewers have complained about the SD card and plastic feel and what happens if you drop it. Well, what happens if you drop ANY tablet eh? It is not good. Drop the steel and glass iPad: sturdy in hand = increased downforce and hence more damage. The Sony is light-very light in your hands. Even though the the actual weight is comparable to the iPad. It is the easiest tablet to hold, hence the least likely to be dropped. End of that particular topic. The SD card... works perfectly, just download another video and music player from Android Market. Sony will provide support in the future no doubt for their own Media players.You can play awesome looking Playstation games on the Sony S. 2 are included and they take you into a different world of gaming on a tablet that is the perfect size. Thousands of more games are only a few weeks/months away at most. No other tablet can do that.The Sony eReader is the best implemented digital reader implemented on the tablet. Sony tablet, Sony ebook store-just like Amazon and Kindle.....but in color/backlit of course. Kobo and RIM Playbook combination sucks and all other Android devices have various degrees of success with font and formatting issues ref Kindle/Nook. But Sony has it virtually perfect out of the box. Always room for improvement though...better font choices,border spacing etc.All of this i have discovered in just 2 days. I will keep you posted as time goes on, but hope this helps any potential seekers of tablets.

I did not like the cord that charges the product. I loved the tablet but the cord to recharge the tablet was very loose and did not fit in the tablet very well.

Great with Photoshop & Zbrush but get the correct drivers I bought this slate primarily as a platform to run zbrush and photoshop.  Because the tablet and pen tech is from Wacom I expected performance similar to that of my cintiq and after some work it delivers.  I can run Photoshop CS6 and Zbrush 4r5.  They both work perfectly.  It is a pretty fantastic experience and I highly recommend the slate.  Note that I've had it less than a week so no long term info here.Important things that I discovered after buying:Wacom pens - only "penabled" type pens work.  The pen for my cintiq didn't work.  So I bought another pen that has a button on it for right clicking.  The pen that comes with this slate has not buttons.NO PRESSURE SENSITIVITY in PS or Zbrush out of the box - when I first installed the software I got no sensitivity to pressure.  Then I installed a number of other drivers from asus and wacom.  I got some improvement but it was still spotty.  Then I read on a forum to install the following driver from asus:Wacon ISD_DualTouch_V7.0.2-21 - It is for the Eee Slate EP121, the older model.  But it worked and made this slate feel as good as my cintiq.  This may not work for everyone but I hope this can save some people a little frustration.  I downloaded it from the Asus site under +touchpad for the EP121.It's a shame it doesn't come with this installed.  The driver looks to be over a year old.  Again, I hope this helps and I really love my slate at this point.  I can paint and sculpt anywhere which is what I've always wanted to be able to do.

It is OK Right up front, I'm 63 (that says I'm not computer literate). It does fine.  Sometimes the screen is to sensitive.  I am sure my programs that are on it have biased me a little.  I guess I am wishing that it was for fun, it's not, it's for work so...

A Tablet for the Rest of Us!!! I was in the hunt for an affordable yet quality built tablet for awhile. Then I saw Coby Kyros Mid7127, one of the newest model in the Coby Kyros family. After much research, I've finally ordered one and have been so happy with the purchase. Coby hits it right with this Kyros Mid7127 model. I am pretty amazed on how responsive the screen is, and how it loads the video without a hitch. I've rooted mine and installed google market. Though it's price is affordable, it doesn't really feel cheap and I can say that it's well-built.Buy one if you're looking for a quality tablet and test it for yourself!

EDIT (due to problems) formally - nice as both a Book Reader, and ... Edit:  Sadly, as some others have reported, my Viewpad 7e also showed issues when reading microSDHC cards.  In my case, only 2 of 4 cards that I own would even read.  One of these cards was brand new, and all of them work fine in other devices.  Of the 2 cards that my Viewpad could read, one would un-mount itself and become unreadable within minutes, and the other would work fine for several hours, but randomly either un-mount or corrupt files.  As recommended by Viewsonic Customer Service, I tried reformatting all the cards, both on a PC, and in my Viewpad 7e, but it didn't change anything.I did really like my Viewpad 7e, but I was forced to replace it with another tablet when Amazon was unable to ship a replacement (or give a firm date when one would be available.)Hopefully, the problem I had with the microSDHC card reader on my Viewpad was a fluke (and not indicative of a general design defect of some sort), and if so, I would still rate the Viewpad 7e a fairly good value, because though it lacks some features, like a capacitive touch screen, that are found on other tablets like the Kindle Fire, by way of compensation it has other useful features like cameras, bluetooth, and expandable microSDHC memory.. . . But, for this comparison to work in the Viewpad's favor, the added features (like the micro-SDHC card expansion slot) also have to ACTUALLY WORK.For the record, here are the things that I really liked about my Viewpad -- Both front and rear cameras (fairly rare on such an inexpensive tablet)- 512 k memory, and a 1GHz CPU (better performance than most other low cost tablets)- USB OTG Host capability- Bluetooth (also rare on inexpensive tablets selling below 200 dollars)- Easy to hook up an external keyboard and mouse (works with BOTH Bluetooth and USB)- The multi-touch 7 inch 800x600 screen with it's slightly more spacious 4:3 aspect ratio... (vs. the 7 inch 16:9 screens found on most other devices)- Built in Flash Video in the browser.... And here are some of the things I was not as thrilled about -- The Viewpad 7e's cameras are only so-so (not nearly as good as the built in cameras on the Samsung Galaxy Player 4 for example)- On the Viewpad 7e, if you forget to disable 'Sync' and 'WiFi' with the Power Widget before using the sleep button, the battery will drain really fast for a device that is supposed to be 'sleeping' in low power mode.  My other Android devices (as well as my Netbook PC) will run several days to a week or more while sleeping, but the Viewpad will drain in less than 24 hours if Wifi is not disabled.  Disabling WiFi and Sync will extend this to a few days, which is a little more reasonable, but still less than every other device that I own.- The Viewpad 7e touch screen is resistive, so instead of a nice smooth scratch resistant glassed in front like the Kindle Fire or Nook Tablet, what you see on the Viewpad 7e is a plastic screen that is slightly recessed into a picture frame style bezel (which may present both a durability and an aesthetic issue with some folks) - and of course, you have to use a slightly firmer touch than with a capacitive screen.I didn't find this to be a deal breaker with my Viewpad, because the extra pressure required was fairly light and not too objectionable, and I have to admit that, after careful calibration, the pointing accuracy was excellent (easily as good, and often better, than many of the capacitive screens I have used).-  There is no Compass or GPS on the Viewpad 7e.  I suppose this is forgivable given the low price point, but the only slightly more expensive $200 Galaxy Player 4 has nearly every feature that the Viewpad 7e has, including a 1GHz CPU and 512k of Ram, PLUS more flash memory (8 Gigs) AND both GPS and a Compass - all in a tiny Cell Phone sized package.  Of course this could be explained away as an apples-to-oranges comparison, since the Galaxy Player has only a tiny 4 inch screen; Ok, but how about the 8 inch Vizio Tablet which ALSO has both a Compass and built in GPS plus an even HIGHER RESOLUTION 8 inch 1024x768 screen?  Admittedly, you don't get something for nothing, and the Vizio is a bit more pricey, especially here on Amazon, but over the holidays it sold all around the country for as little as $189.  Bottom line, after not thinking that it would matter, I went on to find that there are a ton of new apps that depend on GPS and Compass, so even if it would have raised the price by 10 or 20 dollars, I would have preferred that the Viewpad 7e include both a GPS and Compass.- Another big negative for many folks is the fact that the Viewpad 7e doesn't have the full Android Market from Google.  Instead, you get Amazon's App Store, and 1Mobile Market.  I bought this device mainly for use as a book reader, and I WAS able to find All my favorite book reader Apps.  The Kindle App comes pre-installed, and between the two markets that were provided, the B&N;'s Nook App, as well as Aldiko, Cool Reader, FBreader were all available.Also, unlike some Android phones, the Viewpad 7e is not blocked from installing Apps from other sources (you just have to select it as an option under settings), so I was able to find and load several Apps by going directly to their respective web sites and downloading the .APK files directly (After a successful download, you  can either just pull down your notification panel and install the app from there, or from `Downloads' on your `All Apps' page.)Because of these other alternatives, I didn't think that the lack of the full Android Market would bug me, but like the GPS thing, I found that I was bugged just a bit by missing access to some of the really cool Google Apps like Google Maps, Google Earth, and Google Sky.On the plus side, I did find that the default firmware on the Viewpad 7e is fairly easy to 'Root' (Gingerbreak did it in one-click), and there are then several fairly easy methods to install the full Google Android Market, so this would not have continued to be an issue for me (had I been able to keep my Viewpad 7e) since access to the full Android Market can fairly easily be added (though I understand that not everyone will want to have to hack their tablet to make it do what they want it to...)I also had plans to fix the lack of a GPS on my 7e by adding a tiny TomTom external Bluetooth GPS (only about 10 dollars here on Amazon) but fate intervened, and as I noted in my first paragraph above, I had no choice but to return my Viewpad 7e due to a problem with the built in microSDHC card reader.Overall, despite the issues I mentioned, I did like my Viewpad 7e, and still consider it to be a pretty good 'starter' Android Tablet.On the other hand, if you think you would be bugged by the lack of a capacitive screen, GPS, and access to the full Android Market (and are willing to spend a few dollars more), I suggest that you check out the Samsung Galaxy Player 4 or 5 (which have 4 and 5 inch screens respectively) or the Vizio 8 inch tablet.To replace my ill-fated Viewpad, I ended up picking up a refurbished Vizio 8 inch tablet for just under $200, and then, because the Vizio is a bit larger and I missed the portability, I picked up a little Samsung Galaxy Player 4.With the Vizio, I lost the Viewpad 7e's rear side camera, but gained a beautiful larger 1024x768 glass surfaced capacitive screen which works very nicely.  I do notice though, that on the Vizio, the standard home-screen 'launcher' App is really sluggish compared to what I was seeing on my Viewpad 7e, and unlike my Viewpad, the Vizio doesn't give you the option to just use the standard Android launcher (which I fixed by loading the Go Launcher from the market).  Also, though the Vizio's screen is only technically one inch larger than the Viewpad 7e, the difference in portability and general `hand-hold-ability' is pretty noticeable.  Though I found it fairly easy to hold my Viewpad 7e in one hand, the Vizio is definitely more of a prop-it-in-your-lap type device.And lastly, since I mentioned also getting a Galaxy Player 4, you may be wondering about how it stacks up against the others.The answer is - in comparison to both the Vizio 8 inch tablet, and my original ViewSonic Viewpad 7e, the Samsung Galaxy Player 4 (which is also based on Android 2.3) is flat out the slickest, best working, and most powerful Android Tablet of the three.- The Galaxy Player has a super smooth and accurate capacitive touch screen.- The Galaxy Player Plays nearly every video format you can think of right out of the box.- The Galaxy Player has a noticeably better front camera than either the Vizio or Viewsonic, and a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER back camera than the Viewpad 7e (Vizio has no back camera at all)- Compared to both the others, the Galaxy Player 4 is smoother and more stable, and both the Web Browser and Flash video are more reliable.- My Galaxy Player 4 battery life is actually better than my previous Viewpad 7e and roughly on a par with the 8 inch Vizio (5 hours when playing multi-media, and longer when used as a book reader or for other low-cpu tasks at reduced screen brightness)Hard to believe that a tiny device that is mostly billed as an MP3 and Video Player can out class two dedicated Android 2.3 Gingerbread Tablets, but that's the way it is.Pretty much the ONLY thing that the Samsung Galaxy Player 4 gives up to the other two tablets is their larger screens, but if you can live with the Galaxy Player's diminutive 4 inch screen (which is razor sharp by the way), in terms of it's raw performance as an Android tablet, it's the best of the three by a wide margin.Sorry to drift off into discussions of the pluses and minuses of the tablets I purchased to replace my defective Viewpad, but I thought that a few direct side by side comparisons might help anyone who is comparison shopping.

 Length:: 0:51 MinsI have used just about 2 weeks I am satisfied with the purchaseThe screen size is perfect unlike other 7-inch tablet to rotate a screen is very narrow, I struggled a bit to adapt to the use of the screen because I have a phone with capacitive screen and responds to touch and very sensitive this should push a little harder (no need stylus pen)The battery life is acceptable around 5 to 6 hours with uninterrupted useThe screen resolution could be better but I remind that cost me less than $ 200I play movies (avi) files without problemsMake video calls anywhere without sitting in front of a pcThe front camera can be used for emergency and videos or photos is not very practical to take pictures with a very large device further that the quality is not the best if there is no daylightThe sound of the speakers is acceptable in indoor environmentnegativeThe gogle app (gmail, youtube) can not be installed unless root the device. (very easy to do in three clicks, I have not done it yet for fear of not being able to have future firmware updates)It's a bit heavy compared to the Kindle firecreaks when handling but it feels solidthe location of the volume button is very close to the button that locks the screenedited 10/02/12after approximately one month of use the device stopped working under normal conditions of use (not root) 1 month ago was sent to the manufacturer's authorized service technician in Venezuela who reported that the device had to be replaced and I'm still waiting for the new one

Great tablet! Specs, looks and performance justify the price. Got this Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus two days after it launched from Amazon. Just to start, I own a Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S1)phone and I have tried my friend's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 a couple of times. Those are the only items I can compare on (I know they're not comparable to other tablets similar with the Tab Plus 7.0) but these are just a basis in case you own those devices.Screen:I am just basing this on what it looked like since I am a little bit lazy to research on the exact resolution of each screen. The screen on the Tab 7 Plus is somewhat similar in looks with the 10.1 but falls short when you're used to using a Super AMOLED screen (in my case, my Galaxy1 phone) I see the big difference every time I switch between the tab and my phone. SAMOLED screen is sharper and has very high contrast. But if you haven't owned a device with an amoled screen, you would give this tab's screen 5 stars because it's really good compared to other tablet screens i've seen in Bestbuy.GPS:Very spot on! (at least compared to my Captivate phone which had some issues before I installed a custom firmware on it) I have not tried navigation yet which I know should be the ultimate test on a gps but I walked about a mile with it and seems great to me. "GPS status" app from market locks up 12-14 satellites with SNR constant to about 40. But again, I haven't tried yet on how it deals with driving. I will have to give you an update on that..**UPDATE: 11/18. I tried driving for an hour upstate and back using Google Navigation (phone data is tethered to the tab plus, took about 5MB of map data in 2 hours). It's very accurate and responsive. It did not have any problems at all. :)Speed:Dual core SoC Exynos 1.2Ghz.. Very fast! Smooth scrolling and very fluid. One of the reasons why I didn't get the tab 10.1 is for some reason, its scrolling are not that smooth even if I try other launchers. But this tab plus 7.0 really makes the 10.1 look bad when it comes to simply scrolling. Launching apps is very fast as well. I haven't encountered any hiccup within an app. I have yet to try playing graphic intensive games. Will update again..Universal Remote? (Peel SmartRemote App):This is one of the reason why I got this tablet. There are limited tablets out there who has a built-in IR port for controlling Home theater systems. The app is pretty good but I don't think this can replace a Logitech Harmony remote right away since this software is pretty new. Their database for devices is somewhat limited for me. I own an old Samsung 46 inch LCD which the app can control. It can also control my Time Warner cable box and my Denon AVR 1911 receiver (ON/OFF/VOLUME/INPUT SOURCES only. doesn't support all buttons. I love the way Peel displays all the TV shows that are currently. You won't need to browse through the guide on your tv anymore. You can display based on genre (drama, comedy, action, sports etc) and you can even personalize your channels from there. Bottomline, the app is currently good on replacing you TV/Cable remote but is still limited in supporting other remotes. As for streaming players, it only has support for Apple TV and Roku for now. I submitted a request to Peel to support WDTV Live device, let's see how it turns out. By the way, search youtube for "Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Universal Remote". Someone did an early post on what the universal remote app looks like.**UPDATE 1/17/2012: I ended up buying a Logitech Harmony 650 for only $49 (sold by Amazon and it's an excellent remote for the price!) because I gave up on the Peel app because the app development is very slow. At the very least, they do reply when you ask for support but I don't think this Smart Remote app is priority to them.WIFI:I get around the max 15Mbps limit on my Speed test app on this comparing to 5Mbps on my Captivate phone connected to 2.4GHz band. I tried the 5Ghz band and had same result for the Tab plus. I guess I have to try another app that would display more accurate results. My point is that it is fast. Browsing is very fast and very smooth. I watch HD trailers on the Movie Fone app and youtube without any hiccup.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Speed definitely varies and has different factors like ISP, router, wifi chipset, CPU specs, OS etc. But I recently noticed that the wifi of this tab has the same performance as my desktop on quadcore proc, 12GB ram, dualband wifi, windows 7 64bit specs. Goes up to 30Mbps (Time Warner turbo boost)on my 15Mbps connection.Camera:Pretty good. 3MP back and 2MP front is enough to take decent pictures and videos. Did Skype a couple of times and they say my video quality on both cams is good. Oh and audio quality is superb and LOUD considering its size!Size and Weight:This is pretty much a perfect balance between a phone and a laptop for me. Fits in your pocket and it's big enough to browse and watch movies. It has a very premium feel. Build quality is awesome.Battery:So far so good. I've only had this for two days, charged a couple of times for a few minutes to an hour but I've only had it charged to 100% once. And battery performance is great!**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Battery has been superb for me lasts about 7-8 hours of almost nonstop use (surfing the web, youtube, music, skyping, streaming videos and downloading files. Battery drain is very little on standby so I won't worry if I don't use it for a couple of days.Overall:This is a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking great looks, performance and portability. For you guys who are used to having super AMOLED screens, you might want to wait for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 version but it will definitely come at a higher price. But I don't think it will be worth it if its price goes $100 higher than the Tab 7.0 Plus. I think I would prefer a 7 inch screen which is just right for one hand. We'll see when the 7.7 gets released.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012- Now that the price for this tab is only $350, I'd forget about the tab 7.7. I am 100% contented with this after almost 3 months of use. I've been using this without any problems at all and it always gives me the best performance regardless of how many apps i throw at it. Definitely worth every penny!

Great Enterprise Tablet I'll start by saying I love the system and use it all the time.  My laptop sits on a shelf now and I use this for everything now (hasn't changed 5 months later)....*** something to add from my experience with this product -- I've slowly given over to using the Windows 8 side of my hard drive almost exclusively now and I am loving it.  IMO, once you get used to the Win8 interface and how to find things, it really is a good OS for tablets.  Especially tablets like this where you can dock it and use like a desktop.  I am using it in that fashion right now with the standard bluetooth keyboard and a 3rd party bluetooth mouse.  It works great.  And I'm fine with Win8 in this environment because of the desktop side of the interface (and you really don't miss the old standard start button after a while)  And when I move to using it as a touch screen tablet I just go back to Metro (or whatever it's called now) and it's a good experience, minus the fact that IE9 metro app in the preview build doesn't support flash, but this is sure to change.Anyway, ther are some additional things I'd like to cover after my 5+ months of use now.Starting with the bad:-- there is an issue I found with the screen recognizing it's boundaries when using touch or WACOM pen and thus calibrating incorrectly - but it isn't hardware related (whew!).  It was near perfect calibration at first, and then I noticed it slowly losing the ability to locate the edges to the point where there was a nearly 1/2" gap between the systems peercieved edge and where the actual screen edge was, so I couldn't use that 1/2" of the screen.  Now this would be serious, except after debugging, I found the issue.  It isn't a Samsung hardware issue because when I booted back into Windows 7 (like I said, I almost never use Win7 anymore) I noticed this wasn't an issue.  I could touch the whole screen and use the entire width and length for writing.  So there is a bug in how Windows 8 processes the drivers and calibrates the touch screen.  They, Microsoft, assured me that this is being worked out and will not be an issue at release in October.  I'll keep my fingers crossed, but at least I know there's a solution that can be found since, like I said, Windows 7 does not have this issue.Now, some good:-- at home, I found the integrated INTEL WiDi to be awesome!!!  I use this tablet now to stream ESPN3 games to my TV all the time, as well as assorted videos, SKYPE calls, you name it.  It makes this an awsome multimedia device and I can just hold it on the couch, punch up what I want, and then go set it in it's dock and watch what I want on the TV.  It's cool and it only cost an additional $50 for a reciever to hook to my home theatre.  I totally undervalued this feature at first.-- the onscreen keyboard isn't great, but I've gotten used to it.  And it has multiple languages, so I can type Middle Eastern characters with ease and switch keybard layouts to find one that's convenient.  I've gotten pretty good at using it on airplanes and in airports, etc.  But it's also very easy to just carry the keyboard with meto use on tables (not good on airplane seat tables :( --  but the whole setup is much smaller than a laptop and almost the same as an ultrabook.-- people complaining about sound.  I still haven't noticed it?  It can get loud at times, breifly, but it's not that loud and definately not consistant.  probably depends on how you use it, but I've played Civ V for 2 hours on an airplane and never had much problem.  I don't know.Anyways - I have to say that until Windows 8 releases and I see the touch screen issue fixed, I'd be a little warry.  You might want to wait until after It's released to purchase this.  because if it stays as is, this is a 2 star product.  if the issue is resolved, absoutely 5 star.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:Pros:- Solid state drive is super fast (honestly I can boot in often less than 20 seconds and wake from sleep in less than 4).- limited bloatware, less than 1 GB by my calculation, and some of it is very useful like the system set up tools and even the Samsung sort of App center GUI overlay that you activate by pressing the "home" button.- processor and integrated Intel graphics chipset is powerful enough for almost any business task, movies, music, and some games.- the Wacom digitizer pen is well supported and the capacitive touch screen is very good.  Navigating on this is a breeze for me.  Palm rejection is some of the best I've seen- Design of the system is very high grade.  It feels like a very polished product and there isn't anything flimsy about it, from what I can tell.  (*caveat* I've heard tell of the screen delaminating on some folks.  I'd buy a screen protector to prevent this.  That's what I've done and I've noticed no problems.  You just have to give the 'rubbery' feel of the screen protector to fade after a couple days of use to get use to writing on the screen again)- Runs very well on Windows 8, so it's an easy system to upgrade once that OS comes out.  There's a reason Windows chose this as a demo platform for their new OS.Cons:- the battery life could always be improved.  Heavy use with video and /or gaming will net you only about 2.5 - 3.5 hours, and using very strict power management settings you still may only squeeze out about 5 - 6 hours of use for strictly business apps.  And of course there's no option for a spare battery.- The micro SD memory slot is stupid.  It should be a standard SD memory slot as that is what most people use in their other devices, such as digital cameras.  There's really little reason, I think, that there isn't a standard SD memory slot here.  I find this the most annoying feature- No integrated SIM card support.  I would love to be able to just pop in a SIM card from a cell network and be able to get online.  USB dongles for cellular data are such a pain, especially in a system as form functional dependent as a slate tablet.  Also this brings me to.....- only one USB slot.  There's another on the dock, but now that the system has no SIM card support and only micro SD memory option, I'm often using a USB cell modem and a USB thumbdrive.  I now have to chose which one I want to plug in at any time.  Second most annoying feature.- Camera is terrible.  You'll read other reviewers mention how awful it is, seriously, it is worse.  Worse than what you even think.  I had a webcam in 1998 that produced better video and still pictures than the camera on this system.  I'll never use the camera, so I don't really care, but just so you're aware.That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  For more detail keep reading.Since I received this tablet and got it set up, it has immediately become my everyday laptop!  It's fast & powerful, I can run all the applications I need on a daily basis to include MS Office 2010, Photoshop CS4,IBM Lotus Forms, and my offices CITRIX network apps. In addition, I like to play the Civilization series of games and this handles CIV IV on if highest graphics settings and even CIV V on its lowest setting. Also, movie viewing is crisp through Netflix or iTunes. The built in speakers leave something to be desired, but they are as good as what's on an iPad.  But, for me, this is mostly a work tablet, otherwise I would have just stuck with an iPad for my entertainment.My set up included the dock and bluetooth keyboard.  In addition I purchased the Samsung Series 7 Slate cover/stand.  It should be noted that the cover/stand doesn't work with the dock.  You'll need to remove your computer from the cover in order to attach it to the dock.  But for me, I don't really use the dock at all, and the cover/stand is rubbery enough to get a good grip on slick surfaces that I just use it as the stand when I'm typing using the bluetooth keyboard.The keyboard itself isn't too bad.  I've read some reviewers saying it felt "gummy".  It doesn't feel that way to me, and the more I've used it, Iv'e found it to be very responsive allowing me to type accurately.  It's probably a matter of preference.  Of course, I've been able to use other bluetooth keyboards or USB keyboards without issue if I wanted to.I'm a big user of OneNote for taking meeting notes and marking up documents, and it works great on this system.  The digitizer pen is very good, with good pressure recognition, and pretty good palm rejection.  Sometimes though, I actually turn off the capacitive touch screen during meetings so that only the pen is recognized in order to prevent any accidental jumping around on the display.  This is easily done on the Windows control panel.  I've used a few other tablets for this purpose, a Gigabyte T1028, and a Lenovo Thinkpad convertable x220.  Obviously, neither of those our Slate tablets, so it might not be fair to compare them directly, but I like this Samsung Series 7 Slate much better for my purposes.  It's easily more portable and it's handwriting recognition works as well if not better than that on the Lenovo, which before this I would have called the standard.  For my primary purposes, this is a great system.As far as typing, like typing on any tablet, the touch screen keyboard takes getting used to.  Samsung provides a Swype style keyboard as standard software that you can set as your default keyboard to replace the Windows touch screen keyboard, and it works well if you get used to it.  But realistically, if I'm typing long paragraphs, then I pull out the bluetooth keyboard - it's small enough for me to throw in my bag every day along with the Slate.Handwriting recognition by Windows is pretty good, if you've never used it.  I suggest taking the time to go through the "Learn Your Handwriting Style" feature in the Tools menu to help set it up, but it also natively learns your handwriting as you make corrections, so it becomes a quick way to enter text after a while.  Honestly, I almost never use the touch screen keyboard at all, it's either the handwriting tool or the bluetooth keyboard and it works well for me.The system, because it's running a powerful i5 processor, does seem to heat up at times, but never seems to be dangerously hot.  And I've easily had less powerful laptops that ran hotter than this slate does.  And the cooling system and fan are relatively quiet as well.  I have no issues with cooling or sound.The Solid State drive makes this system super fast!  I have Windows 8 Consumer Preview loaded on a partition of the hard drive while retaining my Windows 7 HP factory install partition that I use for most work functions.  Switching between the two by logging out and rebooting literally only takes about 20 - 30 seconds.  Calling up documents and pdf files is almost instantaneous at times.The Hard drive itself (at least the 128 GB model) is pre-partitioned with a 19.8 GB system restore partition.  This leaves you with about 100 GB of actual space, with about 8.5 taken up by Windows 7 and the preloaded Samsung software.  For me, after loading the system with Photoshop, Office Professional, and my Civilization games I had 65 GB left.  So there's lots of space, as much as the largest iPad (just something to consider) and there's an option to create your own system restore disks, so you can theoretically wipe the whole drive clean I suppose and end up with about 80+GB of free storage space after software install.The battery life is really good for me.  Like I said, I use it mainly for meeting notes and marking up documents.  Using the Slate in this manner, along with about 30 min - an hour of web browsing gives me about 5.5 hours of battery life on a full charge.  I easily make it a full 8 hour day without recharge because I use the power button to put the system to sleep anytime I set it down.  (The system wakes up in less than 2 seconds and you can set a quick picture password using the Samsung system manager software so literally I wake the system up and I'm back to taking notes in less than 4 seconds.)Like I said in the beginning, for me, this system does it all and it's about as light and portable as my Kindle.  The only place I could see myself missing my old Thinkpad would be when I'm on the plane, as I could see the set up being a little less stable in that sort of environment than a standard laptop.  Anywhere else however and I'm happy to pull this out all the time.So for the cost of this system, if you plan to use it like I do, as pretty much a replacement for you're standard laptop, then I'd say it's worth the price.  I love it.

Worst investment I've done I was looking for a desktop-laptop-pad cross over. Unfortunately, this is cross over offers more difficulties than solutions.In the past year I have hardly ever used it.

Perfect size I bought my Galaxy Tab 8.9 about a year ago.  I think 10 inches is too big and 7 inches is too small.  The 8.9 I think is the perfect size for a tablet.  It is portable, has an excellent screen and is fast.

Excellent tablet Since I received, I have been using it, non-stop: It's really beyond my expectations.The purchase also went with no problems whatsoever.

One of the best tablets I purchased the Motorola Xoom 3G from about one month ago ,having read a lot of bad reviews about this product , i found this product an awesome one , the 3G operation is like a magic touch you just insert the sim card and the Xoom will do the rest by itself , upgrading the system to HC 3.2 and you will have  a very excellent and reliable tablet charging only in 2 hours fully charged to give you about 8 full hours of continuous operation. The model number for the tablet is MZ601 , so buy it and enjoy.

Rocks This tablet is amazing. I use it nearly every day for personal and work email, news, rss feeds, facebook... It is so powerful and has so many options I don't see myself needing another tablet until this one just poops out on me. No sign of that happening soon thanks to the tough construction.

Asus Transformer Prime 32 GB Champagne Gold - Review Updated 01/23/12!!! ****Update January 23, 2012:  I thought I would post that I have decided to return my Prime TF201.  I'm on my second one actually because of a few problems.  I still think that this is a great device for those that aren't having the problems.  But for me, it just wasn't worth the hassle.I have 2 problems.  First are the physical defect on both that I received.  The first one, as I mentioned below in my initial review, was the scratch on the Gorilla Glass.  Had I put the scratch there, I wouldn't have a problem because it isn't scratch proof, rather, it is only scratch resistant.  So I went on to tablet #2 and there are no scratches on the screen this time, however, there are dents on the silver border around the screen when looking at it straight on.  One at the top and 2 at the bottom.  While this may not bother some, I'm paying good money for this and I want it as close to flawless as possible.  Also, the port for charging seems to be dented a little as well.  It still fit the charger, but it looks like someone pressed really hard on the metal around the port and bent it downward.  AGHHProblem 2:  The second problem, on both devices is that once upgraded to ICS, I have numerous lockups and reboot problems.  Too many to consider keeping it.  I feel that this isn't really the Prime's fault but more an ICS problem, and may be fixed in a future update, but I can't take it.  On the first tablet, it happens while doing any simple task, like scrolling thru a page on the default browser, or playing a simple game, or using the camera.  It is just not acceptable for me.  It locks up for about what seems to be 20 seconds, then automatically reboots itself.  Then it is good for a short while, like 15 minutes, and then it does the same thing.  I really hate making this decision but it just has to be done.  Also, for those concerned, the GPS update seemed to help mine slightly for locking onto satellites with no WIFI turned on, but was still not very strong. And the Wifi strength, after careful testing and review, was just too weak.  Dropping it a star due to both of them having physical defects.****Update January 9, 2012:  I just received my Ice Cream Sandwich update to 4.0.3 and it went smoothly,  plus there was another camera update as well right afterwards.  When the tablet boots up now, it gives the option to unlock and go to the main screen if you swipe to the right, or go straight to the camera if you swipe to the left.I was hoping for the ability to move apps to the SD card, but no such luck yet.  Mine is not rooted.  Although my bootup time went from 3 mins 30 secs down to 1 min 31 secs with ICS then even down to 1 min 20 secs the next time I booted up.  I like the long hold on the main screen for Live Wallpapers and plain photo wallpapers.For those that thought ICS may improve GPS functionality, it did not for mine.  I figured as much, but thought I'd test it out.  Wifi seems the same as before the update.  Though mine seems very good cause I'm always near the router.  (But like I said below, I'm NOT using this for GPS functionality.  If you are, and you like the Prime for the specs, wait for the new Prime TF700t.  Even though in my opinion, it doesn't look as nice and it costs more.  Or wait for the smaller 7" tablet, unnamed as of yet, which will also run ICS and have the Tegra 3 processor.  ANd it will only be $249.00.  Or look around.  Lots to choose from.)Looks like they also included an updated version of the web browser.  I also see a Downloads App in the app section.I like the transitions from screen to screen in the app section as well.  Although, while scrolling to the Widgets section after the apps, mine just locked up and this was after 5 mins from a fresh boot.  Not sure what that was about.  I couldn't do anything but the tablet rebooted on its own.  I'm sure there will be updates to come to clear any glitches.****Update January 3, 2012:  for those concerned about the locked bootloader, Asus made an announcement they they will provide an unlock key to allow root access at the risk of the user voiding the warranty.  Here is hoping that Asus holds true to their promise, but they usually do.  GPS is another issue for those concerned about it.  I put my star rating back to 5 because Asus has been very good with updates and listening to the buyers.  I just wish there was a way to get a plastic backing to replace the aluminum one for those that need GPS fixed to their wishes.  I hope you all are enjoying your Prime as much as I am.  And those of you waiting for yours to arrive, I'm  sure you will enjoy it, just be aware of the issues before getting it.  Or cancel your order and wait for a better option.  Don't  forget CES 2012 is right around the corner Jan 10-13.  Maybe there will be something more suited to your needs.****Update January 1, 2012:  I added a few photos to the image gallery here on Amazon that I took with the rear camera.  Keep in mind that the photo upload here does not allow the full sized image.  They seem to be compressed and shrunk down in size so you can't see it in full detail, but you get the idea, i hope.  Also, i noticed on Google Earth, everything freezes up after using it for a few minutes.  Then the tablet reboots itself.  This also happened on my original transformer as well.  Did anyone else notice this?  Even with these glitches that I mention, i am very happy with this tablet.  Just want to point out things that i notice when i play around with it.  I suspect that many things will run smoother when ICS comes along, or with future updates by Asus.  I know i mentioned it before but i have to stress how easy it is to clean the screen when the fingerprints get bad.  People seem to point out how easy it is to get fingerprints on it but nobody seems to say how easy they wipe off.  Lastly, i have been reading a lot of negative feedback about the gps.  I did say in my review how mine is slightly off and that for me this is not an issue since i really won't be using this function.  So if you are worried about very accurate gps, you may want to try the prime out at bestbuy or somewhere first.  I have a dedicated gps and cell phone that does gps for me.  I tested my Prime with the 'gps test' app and I lock onto 6 to 10 satellites within 20 seconds indoors but the strength rarely goes above 25 per satellite, (should be over 40). A lot of reviews on the old original transformer complained about the plastic backing, and Asus switches to aluminum and people complain because it blocks wifi and gps.  Watch what you wish for.  I'm still a very satisfied customer overall.****Update December 30, 2011:  Another update to my review.  I have noticed when recording a movie in HD, the auto focus is nice to have, but when it changes focus, upon playback you can hear clicking while it changes focus.  Nothing major but worth noting.  Also, when recording in lower light the movie can go out of focus.  I had to move the camera down to the floor then backto the subject for it to refocus.  Annoying, but tolerable.  Anyone else notice this?  I still love the tablet tho.****Update December 23, 2011:  I wanted to add an additional comment.  Please inspect your screen carefully.  When I got the tablet, I had noticed a small scratch on the Gorilla Glass screen in the upper right side.  I contemplated not doing anything about it, but finally decided that I paid good money for this and deserve a defective-free quality product.  I used Amazon's Help link and chatted online with someone who helped me resolve this rather quickly.  I will do a replacement of my tablet, and since it will be within the return timeframe, it will be at no cost to me.  My concern about this was that it is in high demand and I may not get the new one for quite a while.  I would rather wait a little longer and get a tablet that has no noticeable defect like this.  Some people may not have noticed it because it is a very fine scratch, but it is about 3/4 of an inch long.  I tried wiping it with the provided cloth, thinking it was something on the glass, but sure enough, it is a scratch.  I am currently dropping my star rating to 4 stars because of the promotion of the Gorilla Glass as being scratch resistant.  Here is a quote right from Gorilla Glass' website, "Gorilla Glass features exceptional damage resistance to the scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use."  I am one who takes extra special care of my electronics, and there was nothing that came into contact with the screen except my finger and the provided cloth.  Plus I noticed the scratch as soon as I opened it, but got more worried about it as the days went on.  I really hate to return it, but I can't see living with this, knowing that the screen may scratch even more later.  Maybe someone in the factory did something that caused it to scratch?  I have no idea, but I will be returning it for a new Tablet of the same model and color.  I thought it would be fair to mention this to other people considering buying it.  I really don't see this as an Asus issue as much as a Gorilla Glass (Corning) issue, but I like to be as fair as possible.  I will update again once I get my new replacement item.  Hopefully there will be no other worse defects.Also, for those that want to know, I ran the free AnTuTu Benchmark v2.5 and here are my results while using Honeycomb OS.RAM: 2109, CPU integer: 3662,  CPU float-point: 2794, 2D Graphics: 283, 3D Graphics: 1190, Database IO: 400, SD Card Write: (8.3 MB/s) 83, SD Card Read: (20.2 MB/s) 189, CPU Frequency: 1400 MHz, Total Score: 10710.  I did not test battery life, but it lasts a good while without having to recharge with everyday usage.Now back to my original review:OK, so I will start by saying that my Amazon order was not canceled, and I received my tablet on Tuesday December 20th.  So there was no problem for me as far as my order goes.  However, my docking keyboard still has yet to arrive.  Amazon says it should arrive around January 6th.Please note that I had the original Transformer, but I sold it to a friend and bought this one. So I will do my best to compare, but it has only been several hours that I got to play around with the new one so far.Am I glad I updated to this one, yes.  Are there major noticeable differences?  Some, but not drastic.  Obviously some new Tegra games cannot be played on the original Transformer, so there are the obvious hardware updates to this Prime model.The new operating system, due later, may make this tablet act completely different.  So I will update once that comes out also.Pros:* Tegra 3 chip makes for more powerful gaming with games that are designed for it, as well as overall performance improvements.* The enhancements on Honeycomb OS are subtle, but nice.  Hopefully ICS will be a HUGE improvement.* The screen has that special coating that they talked about, and although it does fingerprint up like crazy as with any touch screen tablet, it is SO much easier to clean off the prints.  Wow, it is nice.* The rear camera is a huge improvement over the previous model.  Perfect? no, but incredibly improved? yes. The auto focus is nice, although sometimes jittery when making a movie.  But overall it is great.* The rear camera has an LED flash now, which is very nice to have.* I like the gold color a lot more than I thought I would.  It is very subtle.* For only having one speaker this time around, I was impressed by the sound for both music and games and general sound bites.* They included a longer charging cable than the original 3 footer.  Looks to be about 5 foot this time around.  Thanks for that Asus.  The extra 2 feet seriously helps.* The overall-design looks and feels better than the original.* When I opened it, and booted up, I had 2 Asus updates ready for me.* Wifi speeds seemed the same as the previous model.  I didn't test it, just from using it and judging by memory.* The screen looks much improved from the original, even though it is the same resolution, the brightness helps and the colors look better.* Movies look amazing on this screen.* Adobe Flash sites work on this tablet.* Not sure why we need it, but there are 2 microphones this time around.* Asus implemented a new file manager which is really nice and easy to navigate.* Headphones connected sound amazing, and are in stereo. (I read others questioning if headphones would sound good or not)* HDMI port is not the same as the original Transformer.  This is Micro HDMI and the original was Mini HDMI.  But it looks great on my HD TV.Cons:* The Gorilla Glass, which is supposed to be scratch resistant, came with a scratch on it.  See my update above for details.* As far as design, the biggest complaint I have is that the power button is hard to press because it doesn't stick out far enough.  You have to try to press it to truly understand.  Took my a while the first few tries.* If you use it, the MicroSD card sticks out more than it did in the original.  Probably due to the Prime's curved edges.  Not a major flaw, but noticeable if you had the original Prime.* As per usual, the more apps you install, the longer the start-up boot time.  Not Asus' fault, but this is with any Android Tablet.  I have quite a few apps installed (I installed 107 apps myself), and while it still shuts down very quickly, it went from taking 30 seconds to boot, all the way up to 4 minutes and 10 seconds now.  That is a LONG boot up.  Like I said, before I installed my apps, it was only 30 seconds.  Anyone else experience this?* There have been a few glitches in some apps that I've used.  I will try to take note as to which ones and update on here.* Some movies that I had were not able to be played on the default player.  I downloaded MoboPlayer and the codecs and no problems now.* There is only one speaker.  Granted, it is great sound, but still only one speaker?  What were they thinking?  I guess it was a design limitation?  I have no idea here.  But it least it is loud and great quality for one speaker.Let me tell you that this one, compared to the original model, does not feel that different as far as noticing performance improvements. As I stated before, this may (or may not) change when we get the new ICS operating system later.  I don't want to sound biased and say that it will be amazing with ICS, but logically it makes sense that it will run smoother and faster overall, with the exception of older apps that aren't designed around the quad core, etc.So don't expect to see an astonishingly noticeable difference if you played with the original Transformer.I plan to upload some videos to youtube soon that show the use of the front and rear camera as well as some still photos.If I notice anything else, positive or negative about the Prime, I will post as soon as I get the chance.My overall review:  This was worth the extra money in my opinion.  I like to keep my gadgets up to date, and I loved the specs on this tablet.  If you have the extra money, I say go for it, or at least wait until ICS operating system comes out to hear if it really makes a big impact on performance, or to see if it is all hype.  It was a major bummer about the scratch on the front, but I am very particular about things like that when you pay over $100 for an item.  I hope that everyone gets theirs soon also, just don't forget to inspect your glass.  You only get a short time to return the item, so test it out.

 Length:: 6:19 MinsThis tablet has been nothing but awesome to me so far. GPS "issues" were fixed with the latest firmware update and WiFi signal strength has been average, which is acceptable. Everything about the tablet is built great. I have no regrets with my purchase!

Asus Transformer Prime 32 GB Champagne Gold - Review Updated 01/23/12!!! ****Update January 23, 2012:  I thought I would post that I have decided to return my Prime TF201.  I'm on my second one actually because of a few problems.  I still think that this is a great device for those that aren't having the problems.  But for me, it just wasn't worth the hassle.I have 2 problems.  First are the physical defect on both that I received.  The first one, as I mentioned below in my initial review, was the scratch on the Gorilla Glass.  Had I put the scratch there, I wouldn't have a problem because it isn't scratch proof, rather, it is only scratch resistant.  So I went on to tablet #2 and there are no scratches on the screen this time, however, there are dents on the silver border around the screen when looking at it straight on.  One at the top and 2 at the bottom.  While this may not bother some, I'm paying good money for this and I want it as close to flawless as possible.  Also, the port for charging seems to be dented a little as well.  It still fit the charger, but it looks like someone pressed really hard on the metal around the port and bent it downward.  AGHHProblem 2:  The second problem, on both devices is that once upgraded to ICS, I have numerous lockups and reboot problems.  Too many to consider keeping it.  I feel that this isn't really the Prime's fault but more an ICS problem, and may be fixed in a future update, but I can't take it.  On the first tablet, it happens while doing any simple task, like scrolling thru a page on the default browser, or playing a simple game, or using the camera.  It is just not acceptable for me.  It locks up for about what seems to be 20 seconds, then automatically reboots itself.  Then it is good for a short while, like 15 minutes, and then it does the same thing.  I really hate making this decision but it just has to be done.  Also, for those concerned, the GPS update seemed to help mine slightly for locking onto satellites with no WIFI turned on, but was still not very strong. And the Wifi strength, after careful testing and review, was just too weak.  Dropping it a star due to both of them having physical defects.****Update January 9, 2012:  I just received my Ice Cream Sandwich update to 4.0.3 and it went smoothly,  plus there was another camera update as well right afterwards.  When the tablet boots up now, it gives the option to unlock and go to the main screen if you swipe to the right, or go straight to the camera if you swipe to the left.I was hoping for the ability to move apps to the SD card, but no such luck yet.  Mine is not rooted.  Although my bootup time went from 3 mins 30 secs down to 1 min 31 secs with ICS then even down to 1 min 20 secs the next time I booted up.  I like the long hold on the main screen for Live Wallpapers and plain photo wallpapers.For those that thought ICS may improve GPS functionality, it did not for mine.  I figured as much, but thought I'd test it out.  Wifi seems the same as before the update.  Though mine seems very good cause I'm always near the router.  (But like I said below, I'm NOT using this for GPS functionality.  If you are, and you like the Prime for the specs, wait for the new Prime TF700t.  Even though in my opinion, it doesn't look as nice and it costs more.  Or wait for the smaller 7" tablet, unnamed as of yet, which will also run ICS and have the Tegra 3 processor.  ANd it will only be $249.00.  Or look around.  Lots to choose from.)Looks like they also included an updated version of the web browser.  I also see a Downloads App in the app section.I like the transitions from screen to screen in the app section as well.  Although, while scrolling to the Widgets section after the apps, mine just locked up and this was after 5 mins from a fresh boot.  Not sure what that was about.  I couldn't do anything but the tablet rebooted on its own.  I'm sure there will be updates to come to clear any glitches.****Update January 3, 2012:  for those concerned about the locked bootloader, Asus made an announcement they they will provide an unlock key to allow root access at the risk of the user voiding the warranty.  Here is hoping that Asus holds true to their promise, but they usually do.  GPS is another issue for those concerned about it.  I put my star rating back to 5 because Asus has been very good with updates and listening to the buyers.  I just wish there was a way to get a plastic backing to replace the aluminum one for those that need GPS fixed to their wishes.  I hope you all are enjoying your Prime as much as I am.  And those of you waiting for yours to arrive, I'm  sure you will enjoy it, just be aware of the issues before getting it.  Or cancel your order and wait for a better option.  Don't  forget CES 2012 is right around the corner Jan 10-13.  Maybe there will be something more suited to your needs.****Update January 1, 2012:  I added a few photos to the image gallery here on Amazon that I took with the rear camera.  Keep in mind that the photo upload here does not allow the full sized image.  They seem to be compressed and shrunk down in size so you can't see it in full detail, but you get the idea, i hope.  Also, i noticed on Google Earth, everything freezes up after using it for a few minutes.  Then the tablet reboots itself.  This also happened on my original transformer as well.  Did anyone else notice this?  Even with these glitches that I mention, i am very happy with this tablet.  Just want to point out things that i notice when i play around with it.  I suspect that many things will run smoother when ICS comes along, or with future updates by Asus.  I know i mentioned it before but i have to stress how easy it is to clean the screen when the fingerprints get bad.  People seem to point out how easy it is to get fingerprints on it but nobody seems to say how easy they wipe off.  Lastly, i have been reading a lot of negative feedback about the gps.  I did say in my review how mine is slightly off and that for me this is not an issue since i really won't be using this function.  So if you are worried about very accurate gps, you may want to try the prime out at bestbuy or somewhere first.  I have a dedicated gps and cell phone that does gps for me.  I tested my Prime with the 'gps test' app and I lock onto 6 to 10 satellites within 20 seconds indoors but the strength rarely goes above 25 per satellite, (should be over 40). A lot of reviews on the old original transformer complained about the plastic backing, and Asus switches to aluminum and people complain because it blocks wifi and gps.  Watch what you wish for.  I'm still a very satisfied customer overall.****Update December 30, 2011:  Another update to my review.  I have noticed when recording a movie in HD, the auto focus is nice to have, but when it changes focus, upon playback you can hear clicking while it changes focus.  Nothing major but worth noting.  Also, when recording in lower light the movie can go out of focus.  I had to move the camera down to the floor then backto the subject for it to refocus.  Annoying, but tolerable.  Anyone else notice this?  I still love the tablet tho.****Update December 23, 2011:  I wanted to add an additional comment.  Please inspect your screen carefully.  When I got the tablet, I had noticed a small scratch on the Gorilla Glass screen in the upper right side.  I contemplated not doing anything about it, but finally decided that I paid good money for this and deserve a defective-free quality product.  I used Amazon's Help link and chatted online with someone who helped me resolve this rather quickly.  I will do a replacement of my tablet, and since it will be within the return timeframe, it will be at no cost to me.  My concern about this was that it is in high demand and I may not get the new one for quite a while.  I would rather wait a little longer and get a tablet that has no noticeable defect like this.  Some people may not have noticed it because it is a very fine scratch, but it is about 3/4 of an inch long.  I tried wiping it with the provided cloth, thinking it was something on the glass, but sure enough, it is a scratch.  I am currently dropping my star rating to 4 stars because of the promotion of the Gorilla Glass as being scratch resistant.  Here is a quote right from Gorilla Glass' website, "Gorilla Glass features exceptional damage resistance to the scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use."  I am one who takes extra special care of my electronics, and there was nothing that came into contact with the screen except my finger and the provided cloth.  Plus I noticed the scratch as soon as I opened it, but got more worried about it as the days went on.  I really hate to return it, but I can't see living with this, knowing that the screen may scratch even more later.  Maybe someone in the factory did something that caused it to scratch?  I have no idea, but I will be returning it for a new Tablet of the same model and color.  I thought it would be fair to mention this to other people considering buying it.  I really don't see this as an Asus issue as much as a Gorilla Glass (Corning) issue, but I like to be as fair as possible.  I will update again once I get my new replacement item.  Hopefully there will be no other worse defects.Also, for those that want to know, I ran the free AnTuTu Benchmark v2.5 and here are my results while using Honeycomb OS.RAM: 2109, CPU integer: 3662,  CPU float-point: 2794, 2D Graphics: 283, 3D Graphics: 1190, Database IO: 400, SD Card Write: (8.3 MB/s) 83, SD Card Read: (20.2 MB/s) 189, CPU Frequency: 1400 MHz, Total Score: 10710.  I did not test battery life, but it lasts a good while without having to recharge with everyday usage.Now back to my original review:OK, so I will start by saying that my Amazon order was not canceled, and I received my tablet on Tuesday December 20th.  So there was no problem for me as far as my order goes.  However, my docking keyboard still has yet to arrive.  Amazon says it should arrive around January 6th.Please note that I had the original Transformer, but I sold it to a friend and bought this one. So I will do my best to compare, but it has only been several hours that I got to play around with the new one so far.Am I glad I updated to this one, yes.  Are there major noticeable differences?  Some, but not drastic.  Obviously some new Tegra games cannot be played on the original Transformer, so there are the obvious hardware updates to this Prime model.The new operating system, due later, may make this tablet act completely different.  So I will update once that comes out also.Pros:* Tegra 3 chip makes for more powerful gaming with games that are designed for it, as well as overall performance improvements.* The enhancements on Honeycomb OS are subtle, but nice.  Hopefully ICS will be a HUGE improvement.* The screen has that special coating that they talked about, and although it does fingerprint up like crazy as with any touch screen tablet, it is SO much easier to clean off the prints.  Wow, it is nice.* The rear camera is a huge improvement over the previous model.  Perfect? no, but incredibly improved? yes. The auto focus is nice, although sometimes jittery when making a movie.  But overall it is great.* The rear camera has an LED flash now, which is very nice to have.* I like the gold color a lot more than I thought I would.  It is very subtle.* For only having one speaker this time around, I was impressed by the sound for both music and games and general sound bites.* They included a longer charging cable than the original 3 footer.  Looks to be about 5 foot this time around.  Thanks for that Asus.  The extra 2 feet seriously helps.* The overall-design looks and feels better than the original.* When I opened it, and booted up, I had 2 Asus updates ready for me.* Wifi speeds seemed the same as the previous model.  I didn't test it, just from using it and judging by memory.* The screen looks much improved from the original, even though it is the same resolution, the brightness helps and the colors look better.* Movies look amazing on this screen.* Adobe Flash sites work on this tablet.* Not sure why we need it, but there are 2 microphones this time around.* Asus implemented a new file manager which is really nice and easy to navigate.* Headphones connected sound amazing, and are in stereo. (I read others questioning if headphones would sound good or not)* HDMI port is not the same as the original Transformer.  This is Micro HDMI and the original was Mini HDMI.  But it looks great on my HD TV.Cons:* The Gorilla Glass, which is supposed to be scratch resistant, came with a scratch on it.  See my update above for details.* As far as design, the biggest complaint I have is that the power button is hard to press because it doesn't stick out far enough.  You have to try to press it to truly understand.  Took my a while the first few tries.* If you use it, the MicroSD card sticks out more than it did in the original.  Probably due to the Prime's curved edges.  Not a major flaw, but noticeable if you had the original Prime.* As per usual, the more apps you install, the longer the start-up boot time.  Not Asus' fault, but this is with any Android Tablet.  I have quite a few apps installed (I installed 107 apps myself), and while it still shuts down very quickly, it went from taking 30 seconds to boot, all the way up to 4 minutes and 10 seconds now.  That is a LONG boot up.  Like I said, before I installed my apps, it was only 30 seconds.  Anyone else experience this?* There have been a few glitches in some apps that I've used.  I will try to take note as to which ones and update on here.* Some movies that I had were not able to be played on the default player.  I downloaded MoboPlayer and the codecs and no problems now.* There is only one speaker.  Granted, it is great sound, but still only one speaker?  What were they thinking?  I guess it was a design limitation?  I have no idea here.  But it least it is loud and great quality for one speaker.Let me tell you that this one, compared to the original model, does not feel that different as far as noticing performance improvements. As I stated before, this may (or may not) change when we get the new ICS operating system later.  I don't want to sound biased and say that it will be amazing with ICS, but logically it makes sense that it will run smoother and faster overall, with the exception of older apps that aren't designed around the quad core, etc.So don't expect to see an astonishingly noticeable difference if you played with the original Transformer.I plan to upload some videos to youtube soon that show the use of the front and rear camera as well as some still photos.If I notice anything else, positive or negative about the Prime, I will post as soon as I get the chance.My overall review:  This was worth the extra money in my opinion.  I like to keep my gadgets up to date, and I loved the specs on this tablet.  If you have the extra money, I say go for it, or at least wait until ICS operating system comes out to hear if it really makes a big impact on performance, or to see if it is all hype.  It was a major bummer about the scratch on the front, but I am very particular about things like that when you pay over $100 for an item.  I hope that everyone gets theirs soon also, just don't forget to inspect your glass.  You only get a short time to return the item, so test it out.

Amazing Tablet, I'm lovin' it ! Acer Iconia A200-10g16u 10.1-Inch Screen Tablet - Titanium GrayI own the Acer Iconia Tab A-200, 16GB Version, since March 2012. I got mine direct from the Acer Store. I was looking for a Honeycomb OS Tablet which is flawless, I've been reading reviews on various tablets already out there in the market but, couldn't really come across a tablet that have all the positive scores. To give Honeycomb tablets a try, I first got myself a Lenovo Thinkpad tablet, I still can not justify why I went with Lenovo brand as my first choice, it was a horrible expensive experience, It used to restart every 15-20 minutes of use, drops wi-fi within a strong wi-fi zone, GPS never worked and there was ZERO technical support for it. This is where I realized, why so many people write issues in various tablet reviews.Tablets aren't everybody's business...by now there are so many vendors selling tablets in the market but, most of them are here for the sake of having another 'product' linked to their brand. Majorly I see only, Apple, Acer, Samsung, Amazon being serious in the business of Tablets, rest all are just offering sort of trial products.Based on various tablets reviews; being a little hesitant to try another tablet, I selected ACER A200. The choice turned out GREAT ! At $350 it is a gem. The Tablet physical appearance is good with nice rubberized feel to the back.It's 10.1" screen is very good, colors are bright and fresh. The touch sensitivity is perfect and screen touch response is excellent. I like the full-USB availability, where you can plugin your Flash drive, Mouse, Keyboard etc. The battery life is very much acceptable, it runs on Wi-fi for 7 hours straight and it takes 3.5 hours to charge from 15% (low battery mark) to 100%. GPS works brilliant, I use it at far flung places away from Wi-fi and it locks on satellites in less than 10 mins.The GPS feature alone is a heart stealer for a tablet at this price, it doubles your device from a wi-fi tab to a GPS navigation. The 16GB storage (the maximum offered in A200) is pretty much enough (else get a Micro SD card to be plugged in the slot). Off the 16GB storage, 12GB is available for user applications. This is after my A200 recently got a Ice-Cream Sandwich (ICS) official upgrade and some applications I installed. ICS isn't shipped installed when I got my A200 but Acer marketed this product to be upgradeable to ICS when it launches hence, it was a pleasure to have this model. ICS upgrade have made tablet experience a whole lot smooth, screen enhancements and of course web surfing is more responsive. The Speakers on A200 aren't that bad as many reviewers commented, I ran various music test and it is more attributed to the quality of sound encoding, it may not be that thunderous but still i don't want it to be as I don't use the tablet for room filled music listening....I rather use a nice Bluetooth headset which complements the tablet very much.So for those of you, who are reading reviews to make a buying decision....I'd recommend this Product. It's 10.1" Screen, 16GB storage, ICS OS, Perfect GPS are some of its great features. There aren't any issues I've found, no warming, no quick battery drainage, no screen bleeding or color washed out effect...nothing of that sort. To me ACER has build its reputation, they really worked on this model and it will remain a choice for many who are looking for an Android OS tablet. There is and will remain competition in Tablet offerings but, as I mentioned earlier, Tablet isn't everybody's game. Few vendors have already dropped their idea, few like Lenovo will soon look somewhere else. GREAT JOB ACER! for nice working product with good technical support available anytime.

Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.

On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.

Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10" class. I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading "Downloading Apps and Games" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout "multi-touch" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called "AppShopper" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the "popular" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like "Dissolve" with "Zoom in on Faces", or the nifty multi-photo "Origami" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support "AirPrint" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations? UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10" class, but I personally find all 10" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8" than 7". If 10" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)

Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10" class. I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading "Downloading Apps and Games" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout "multi-touch" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called "AppShopper" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the "popular" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like "Dissolve" with "Zoom in on Faces", or the nifty multi-photo "Origami" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support "AirPrint" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations? UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10" class, but I personally find all 10" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8" than 7". If 10" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)

The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!

Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.

Truly a great device! I was one of those people that said "I don't need a iPad, I have a Laptop / PC Desktop / Smartphone." There wasn't a need for a tablet in my life but it would have been nice to catch up with the world in the direction technology is moving. So over the course of years I always dismissed iPad because of it's price. I bought MANY Android Tablets and taking them back because I was disappointed with Issues. Here is a list:- Elocity A7 tablet- Samsung Galaxy Tab- Dell Streak 7- Archos (few of those)- HTC Flyer- Eee Pad Transformer- Xoom- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+Now all of them wasn't bad tablets, they just wasn't working properly after a while. So after all that I gave up on tablets period. I decided that since I have a now Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) It was time to just save and bite the bullet on a iPad....Now I question myself...Why did I wait so long to buy one?!?!This tablet is amazing, It truly a remarkable device. I can see why Apple get's praised for making a device this good and this fluent. While I understand both iOS and Android is different and each it's own (There are some things Android and iOS do better then one another.) but "The New iPad" is leaps and bounds over most tablets that I've tried here is why:Screen:Bright and Vibrant HD Visuals. It's crisp and sharp and reading on this thing is Phenomenal. This is eye candy (or iCandy) pure eye candy to anyone who is a fan of a HD display. Unlike the iPad 2 which I tried at the demo at store there is no way I can go back to a lower resolution tablet due to the fact I am spoiled by this screen. The games look amazing as well. Honestly its like the screen isn't there.Speed:Quick...So quick in everything it does. Web browsing is super fast, Opening apps is super fast, Doing anything is fast. I never owned a iPad 2 so I can't compare the two but I am very happy with it.Apps:Good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store and running perfectly if they are iPad ready. You won't be disappointed. Its one of the best ecosystems on a tablet device. This was my main reason for getting the iPad and I'm sure a lot of other people too. There wasn't a hassle like "side loading" like it was on my first tablet "Elocity A7 tablet" which lead to a terrible user experience for a first timer. The iPad simply just works and I can believe if this your first time having a tablet. You will be happy.iOS 5.1.1 / Camera:It improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. unlike it was before on the first iPad. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. Recording Video is nice! What bad about it is that it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE. I don't see myself using the camera at all to take pictures it's nice that it's there though. Let's face it, I don't think many people would want to use their tablet to take Pictures / Videos. I will just use the front facing cam for face time.Build Quality:Solid and it just feels right in the hand. Just don't drop this tablet at all. it seem like it would break pretty easily. I would get a screen protector like I did and a case to cover the iPad. I notice its a little heavier then the iPad 2 which might be a problem to some people.The bad:Well, The iPad can get warm at times on the back. It's also somewhat restrictive and limited. I would like to have an SD slot to add more storage / lack of customization that iOS such as widgets / and a little bit more open in the market. I can live without these but it would be nice for Apple to open up a little more. The price is expensive but worth it (especially for that screen alone) just little too much just for 16GB of space.Overall:I just want to point out that this Tablet is not for Android junkies, its just not. If your coming from an Android and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys wait for the Nexus Tablet from Google which I will be getting as well.But for people that just want a great user experience with a tablet without any hassle. Even if your a New comer to tablets, I suggest you get the New iPad. Its a little hard to say if you have an iPad 2 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want that drop dead gorgeous screen. But trust me it improves on what the iPad 2 before it had which was a good tablet from the start.It have the best ecosystem, it still has the "just work" aspect and it still one of the best tablets out there. Buy it, enjoy, and have fun!Edit:I took back the 16 GB and got myself a 32GB iPad and I love it to death! Personally I highly suggest getting the 32GB/64GB iPad. its just not enough storage with some Apps ranging to 1 GB+. Thanks to some research I also found out how to do home sharing on iTunes to save space. Still loving this product so far.

The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!

Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10" class. I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading "Downloading Apps and Games" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout "multi-touch" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called "AppShopper" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the "popular" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like "Dissolve" with "Zoom in on Faces", or the nifty multi-photo "Origami" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support "AirPrint" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations? UPDATE: a 7.9" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10" class, but I personally find all 10" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8" than 7". If 10" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)

Lots of problems I bought this tablet back in April after reading lots of reviews and doing lots of research. Unfortunately the problems started almost immediately and I talked myself out of sending it back and now it is too late. For internet browsing, it is almost a complete waste of time. From the very beginning the built in web browser would freeze and I'd sit there for a few minutes watching an unmoving screen until a "Browser has stopped working. Wait or Force Close" error would appear. This error presented itself constantly with almost every app I opened, and every incident of trying to browse the internet. I downloaded the dolphin browser to see if that would fare any better. It did not. I also thought that not having access to Google Play wouldn't be that big a deal, or would be something I could get around via the Amazon mobile marketplace. This is not the case. Because you cannot download from Play you cannot get Facebook and a number of other very popular apps. Getjar's selection is paltry at best, and even trying to download directly from website does not work (most of them reroute you to Google Play anyway).I also had issues with the preinstalled book reader, aldiko. As with all functions it would constantly freeze and I would get the wait or force close error. Often I had to try to open the same app multiple times and I would get the error multiple times until I would run out of free time or just be so frustrated I had to give up.I was hoping that an update to the software might help the problem, since that was the experience I had with my phone; it had suddenly starting having lots of problems which persisted for a few months, until an update came out and from then on it ran very smoothly without any of the old errors.However, THERE IS AND WILL NEVER BE an update for this tablet. It is in the tablets FAQ on the Coby website. This is despite the fact that there is an "automatic update" options in the settings but this is for the apps and not the tablets internal software. Though in the tablet explorer program, I do receive a notice stating an update is available but every single time I have ever tried to update it, I sit and wait for 5 minutes while it downloads, choose the option to install and then get an error every time saying there is conflicting programs so the update could not be installed.And again, Coby's own FAQ states there will not be any updates made for the Coby Kyros 4.0.So I used this tablet mostly as a book reader using the FBreader app and for a while that worked out quite well. Sometimes I could get through to browse the internet, at least enough to check basic things and maybe read an article or two, but I do also have a laptop so for more advanced pursuits I used that.But then about a few weeks ago, a strip of screen about an inch wide, running along the left side of the tablet stopped responding to my touches. This is giving me issues with turning the page while reading, and if I want to type in a search or write an email I am constantly having to turn the tablet in circles in order to get the keyboard keys out of the unresponsive section and this is quite an exercise in patience. Sometimes it is not even possible, because in certain apps and websites the keyboard disappears as soon as the screen is turned to a different angle, and if the space you need to type in cannot be selected without turning the tablet to get to the needed keys, then there simply is no option to type in that field.I am not sure if all the Coby Kyros's have these issues but as I was hoping for an update which never came, I waited too long and now I cannot return the tablet. I could go through Coby's warrantee system but according to its website I have to print some documents and mail a cashiers check with the tablet, where it will then take several months to receive my new one. I am not sure I want to do all that just to be without a tablet at all for months. So I am considering just throwing or giving this one away and buying a new one. NOT a Coby.

Nice cheap alternative I wanted to wait a little while to write a review on this tablet. I received this tablet as a gift when it first came out in June. The android environment is very familiar and friendly. This is actually my third Coby Kyros sent to me.I played with the tablet and installed various apps testing how various stuff effects it. It had a nice long battery life, I was able to play with it for 5 to 7 hours on a single charge. During the first two weeks was great playing, but during a charge the adapter plug on the tablet broke and I had to call Coby Kyros for a replacement. Coby was very friendly and helpful, however you do still have to send $15 for s/h for the next one, plus you have to pay for s/h to ship the broken one back (which is about $7 -$15 depending how you ship it. It took about 4 weeks and they sent . . . well they just sent me a brand new tablet, which is still really nice of them. BUT..... when I received the replacement the wifi had a short in it, and would not stay connected or would not connect at all. I called Coby back and they actually did waive the shipping cost to ship it back. It took about three weeks and they did ship another tablet. I am happy to report so far so good, everything appears to work.It does not integrate with Google Apps that well. I have tried side-loading Google Apps such as Play, Drive, Books, Music, and even the YouTube app with little success. Out of all those only the YouTube app runs, but does not log into Google. I have found that Amazon's App Store does run and a nice alternative to Google Play. One thing Coby need to realize is that since it is an Android is has to be Google App friendly since no one uses GetJar. I did not have hardly any current and popular app (such as Facebook) on GetJar; actually no Facebook app on Amazon's App Store either. That I was able to side-load from my phone. I was able to side-load The Sims Freeplay which was great, because it makes the play much easier. Game-play is nice and doesn't lag to much. Most of the Google Play Apps were able to side-load just fine onto the tablet just fine.However since this is now September and Google/Galaxy Nexus 7 is here I would probably go with that one. But for a nice 10" tablet alternative this will do nicely too.

A great price for a great tablet!! Pros-Price-Android 4.0(Ice Cream Sandwich)-Build Quality-8GB plus microSD expansion-HDMI Out Port-Front facing camera-Different color options-Small and portableCons-No Google Play-Screen resolution-MicroSD card protrudes slightlyWhen I began my quest to purchase a tablet, my wife placed me on a strict budget of $200. Ipad, Samsung and many others were instantly ruled out. After scouring the internet, looking through Best Buy and Walmart I thought I narrowed it down to the Amazon Kindle Fire or maybe the Barnes and Noble Nook. However, both of these devices run very customized versions of Android and cater to their respective stores. Fortunately, I stumbled on to the Visual Land Internet Tablet. Not only was it unaltered Android. It has Android version 4.03. Oh, did I mention the price? It was well under budget so that I could purchase a case also. Did the low price mean cheap and low performing?The box contains the tablet, wall charger, mini usb cable, mini usb to usb cable, in-ear buds and a manual. I was surprised at all the contents. Most higher cost tablets do not have as much accessories included in the box. So far so good!The Visual Land Prestige tablet feels good in the hand. It is all plastic, but is solid. No creaks or groans. Holding the tablet in landscape, you have the mini usb, HDMI(yes, HDMI out), charging port, 3.5 mm headphone jack, microphone, and microSD slot. Phew, that is a ton of ports. Most high end tablets do not come with HDMI out. Way to go Visual Land!! On top is the power button and the volume buttons. The left and bottom is bare. The front of the device has the 7 inch 800 x 400 capacitive touch screen along with a web camera on the upper left corner. The rear of the device has a textured plastic back on most of the back with the left and right edges (in landscape mode) a shiny plastic that is a fingerprint magnet. There is a small opening for the speaker and a reset hole also on the back. A nice touch is that all ports and buttons are labeled so you know exactly what they are. One thing that I do not like is that the microsd card slightly protrudes out from the side. It leaves me a little concerned that it could pop out. It has not  yet and I hope it doesn't.Let me mention the screen. It is a mixed bag. My phones screen has a higher resolution. However, the colors look good as is the viewing angles but you will notice some pixilation at times. The screen is bright enough and responsive to touch. It is not the main selling point, but is not a deal breaker.The Visual Land tablet comes with Android version 4.03. I t has the basic apps you need from you tube to web browser. Documents to Go, Angry Birds and Skype also comes pre-installed. . If you want to get more apps there is the Getjar app store. You could also download Amazons Android App store. You have plenty of options. I have downloaded Amazon Kindle app, the Nook app, Netflix and some games. All the apps run smoothly. Videos stream great. I inserted my 16GB microSD card and all my music, photos and videos were easily accessible!!All in all, I am very happy with this tablet. There is no other tablet that comes close in this price range. If you are on a budget and want a little more than an ereader, this is the device for you.

Works great for me! I love this little jewel! I have owned it for two weeks now and have learned to make it do lots of tricks.  I am a "techie-grandma" and wanted the newest Android system (Ice Cream Sandwich).  Look at the spec's!  It has everything I wanted and it all works well.
