The Slimmer iPad From Apple; Look Ma Face Time The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.Now Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an "iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G" version.The "iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G" FactsOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The "iPad 2" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.New Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.Audio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:o  HE-AAC (V1)o  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)o  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)o  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)o  MP3 VBRo  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)o  Apple Losslesso  AIFFo  WAVThe iPad can view the following document types:o  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);o  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);o  Web pages (.htm and .html);o  Keynote (.key);o  Numbers (.numbers);o  Pages (.pages);o  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)o  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);o  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)Re-syncing with iTunesThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.Transferring My AT&T; 3G AccountAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T; for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.A funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T; killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T; store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.Note: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T; will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to "Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data."VPN AccessThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.First Impressions:Like my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.Today while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.ConclusionsLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...Not that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain "cool" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.

A great device WHEN you consider price and function, with a few flaws UPDATE November 2012 - With the Kindle Fire HD out now, I highly recommend it over this older version, as it fixes many of the problems I mention in my review.  No one should buy this original version of the Kindle Fire unless you can get it for very cheap.  I would also recommend theKindle Fire HD 8.9" over the 7" Fire, as I feel the increased size has a dramatic effect on the tablet experience.The first and most important thing that should be said about the Kindle Fire is that this is not an "iPad-killer."  It is not designed to be.  I have seen so many articles and comments comparing this to the iPad, and surveys where people are asked if they will be buying a Kindle Fire over an iPad this Christmas.  If you are expecting an iPad, or even a tablet, you will be disappointed.  The main purpose of this device is to deliver Amazon content to you more effectively.  It is designed for consumption, not creation. That is the reason it is so cheap and why Amazon is taking a loss on it.  They are hoping to make up for that loss through sales of videos, music, books, and apps through Amazon's Web Services.  You can also use it to view your own movies and media, but will find that it is more limited in that way than a regular tablet.  Personally, as someone who has ordered several rentals from Amazon Video, and had to contact customer support for every single one of them due to problems with Amazon's Unbox player or purchases not appearing in my downloads, I can really appreciate this.  But if you don't plan on using Amazon at all to obtain your media, you may want to take this into consideration before purchasing the Fire.  Additionally, the reason this product is so hyped, and one of the reasons I like it so much, is due to the ridiculously low price.  Amazon reviews shouldn't focus on price, but it is hard not to with this device.  On price alone, this is a five star device.  However when looked at the Fire overall, and when compared with other touch devices (what little there is to compare it to), I have to give it four stars, since there are a few areas I feel could use definite improvement.FORM FACTOR - The Kindle Fire feels almost the same in my hand as my 3rd generation Kindle but it is a bit heavier.  It might be difficult to hold it one handed and read a book for an hour or watch a movie. You're going to need to rest it on something.  The display is made of Gorilla Glass, which is a highly damage-resistant.  You can still crack it, but I have used a phone with Gorilla Glass for two years on it and it has zero scratches on it despite being kept daily in my pocket with my keys.  The back of the tablet is rubberized, so it won't slide around and won't get scratched easily.  It also feels good in my hand.  Despite all the companies that will be selling them, I do not think you need a screen protector.  I have scratched Gorilla Glass before, but it is very difficult to do.CONNECTIONS/STORAGE - On the bottom are a headphone port (which will accept external speakers), micro-USB (for charging and file transfer), and power button.  The Fire doesn't come with an SD card slot, with good reason.  As mentioned, Amazon wants you to get content directly from them.  It also reduces the production costs.  You can transfer your own content to the device through the USB connection from your home computer.  The Fire comes with 8Gb of storage, which is enough to hold about 8 downloaded movies, 80 apps, 800 songs, or 6,000 books. I filled mine up right away so I never checked it out of the box, but apparently it is closer to 6.5Gb as the OS is going to take up some of this.  You have to really become adept at managing your content through the Cloud. Books won't take up much room, but magazines are around 250Mb and movies are a little under 1 Gb.  Free videos available through Amazon Prime cannot be downloaded, only streamed.  So unless you buy a movie from Amazon or transfer one of your own, you must be connected through a wi-fi connection in order to watch your movie.AMAZON CLOUD - If you have not tried out the Amazon Cloud Drive, you will be pleasantly surprised. You get 5Gb (which they will probably increase in the near future) of free online storage to store anything you want, and you can access it from anywhere.  This combines very nicely with the Fire.  5Gb isn't much for my collection, so I upgraded to a higher plan (rates are $1 per extra gigabyte per year).  I can upload a playlist to it and listen to it on my home computer, then when I get to work the Fire can access it and pick it up where I left off.  Any songs you get from Amazon Mp3 are automatically stored on the Cloud and don't contribute to the 5Gb storage space.E-READER - This was going to be the big determination in whether I should get a Fire or the new Kindle Touch.  Ultimately I ended up getting both since I prefer the E-Ink technology to the backlit display of the Fire.  If you are the type of person who reads a lot and expect to spend at least 50% of your use on reading books, I don't think you will be satisfied with the Fire over your Kindle 3 or the Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers. It just isn't the same, and after hours of reading, the display would make my eyes hurt a bit (just like with any tablet).  However it is nice not to have to use a lighted cover to see my books in the dark.  The Kindle Fire is difficult to read in bright sunlight or on the beach.  The touch navigation is very nice, but it doesn't function as nicely or quickly as it does on the iPad or even the Kindle Touch. This can be a problem for me, and the main reason I am using the Kindle Touch for reading books. Additionally, the Fire doesn't support real page numbers, even though the Touch does. So you have to use that ridiculous "location 121 of 16077 - 2%" format. A year of that with my last Kindle and I still don't understand what that means.  They need to fix this in an update.  Being able to touch a word and have it bring up the dictionary is incredibly convenient and takes less than 2 seconds.  But still, the Kindle Touch handily beats the Fire for reading.MAGAZINES - The Kindle Fire can also handle magazines, however the display is just too small to be an enjoyable reading experience.  I tried out several different magazines, and the main problem I had was with the formatting.  I tried to read an issue of Bon Appetit and my eyes were straining after three pages.  There is no way to read a single article without zooming. The Fire handles magazines two ways: with Page View, which shows the original magazine display, and with Text View, which attempts to just provide the text of the article. A lot of magazines these days have several things going on in one page, with multiple columns, little sidebars and boxes everywhere, etc.  I couldn't view a lot of this without zooming, the text is just too small.  So Page View did not work very well for magazines like this.  It is especially tough with magazines like Entertainment Weekly, Men's Health, GQ, etc.  I found magazines like that unreadable on the 7" display.  Magazines that focused mostly on the article, like Nature, Wired, etc, were handled much better.  Some magazines even come integrated with embedded video and audio, which is a very nice feature, and one I can see being very useful for things like Men's Health, but I haven't had as much of a chance to use it yet.  Text View is a very nice feature that works mostly well, but seems to get a bit confused with magazines that have complicated formatting, so it pretty much defeats the purpose since those are the ones I need it for the most.COMIC READER - This is one of the main reasons I purchased the Fire.  Amazon has a fairly extensive collection of comic books available for the Fire, including an exclusive deal with DC to publish many of their books.  In addition to a proprietary comic reader that comes on the Fire, Amazon also has a Comics by ComiXology app available to purchase issues and subscriptions through. Although I initially thought the 7" display would be too small, it is actually decent enough to serve as a comic reader.  I would definitely prefer a 10" version if they came out with one in the future. A 10" tablet is still the way to go for comics, but if you're looking for a cheaper option and portability, the Fire isn't too bad, and definitely beats a smart phone.  It has a "panel by panel" feature that lets you scroll through the issue by different panels, which it will then zoom in on. You tap the panel when done, and it moves to the next panel.  This is great for getting a larger view and working around the size restriction, especially since some of the text in the comics is just too small to read.  Although it is fairly decent, if you are considering the Fire just for comic books, and you are a Marvel fan, you may want to hold off and look at another retailer's device which I think has a few more options.  You can load your own .cbr comic files on the Kindle, but you'll need to use a third party app, like Comicat to do it.AMAZON MP3/VIDEO - Amazon hopes that you will get the majority of your content from them. That is why the Fire is so reasonably-priced.  Amazon music is DRM-free.  DRM is copy protection.  That means that the record labels haven't locked down the music you buy from Amazon to restrict how you use it.  Amazon MP3 music is playable anywhere, even on your Apple devices.  It also has a very high bitrate so you are getting great quality. You don't have to worry about not being able to listen to your music 15 years from now if Amazon goes under. It's yours forever.  As far as video, I have always disliked Amazon's Video services.  The prices are very reasonable and they now have a huge selection, but obtaining the videos is a huge pain due to Amazon's terrible Unbox player. That changes with the Fire, as everything is native and streams/downloads beautifully.  If you make a lot of purchases with Amazon, or if you have several Amazon customers in your household, you should take advantage of their Prime program.  In addition to the large selection of free videos now available to Prime members, the shipping advantages are amazing. I once had a 200 lb exercise bike overnighted to my house for only $3.99.  Everything I order I get within 2 days. The Prime program seems expensive but it has certainly paid for itself over the years for me, and now is even better that it is integrated more with the Fire.  The only problem I have with video playback is that everything I watched did not fully expand to the screen, and was letterboxed.  Considering the small 7" display size, this was an annoyance for me.  I know shows have different aspect ratios, but some should fit the display, and I think many users will be annoyed that they can't zoom or stretch the display to fit.WEB BROWSING - This is another feature I was initially excited about. I like the idea of being able to use the Fire as a netbook.  Amazon advertises "ultra fast web browsing" using Amazon's Silk browser.  It is based off of technology that is designed to increase page loading times by pre-fetching part of the content.  Sounds like a great idea, but doesn't work as well in practice.  I tried out the Fire on several different connections and compared page loading times with other devices (all connected wirelessly).  The Fire was one of the slowest.  Amazon's own web page, which has actually recently been optimized to work with the Fire, takes an average of 7 seconds to load. Other major portals took a similar amount of time or slower. My iPad and my Xoom both load pages much faster.  It is not slow enough to be a problem, but not fast enough to impress me or be worthy of Amazon's marketing regarding it.  This needs to be improved. UPDATE - As of February 2012, page loading times are much improved. It can still be a bit slow and stutter at times, but you can increase this by following the steps at the bottom of this review.  I am mostly satisfied with browsing now, although Silk still occasionally won't recognize it when I touch a link.BATTERY LIFE - Amazon advertises 8 hours of reading or 7.5 hours of video playback.  As an average, that's probably fairly accurate.  During testing I got an average of 7.4 hours of continuous reading, and 7 hours of video playback over five tests for each.  This is a big change over the roughly 30 days of continuous reading with the traditional kindle, so it may hamper you a bit if you're a voracious reader.  I just got into the habit of charging it every night with my cell phone.  You can shut down the Kindle or put it in sleep mode.  I keep mine in sleep mode all the time because it is so efficient that it uses almost no battery. I can leave it in sleep mode for 2 days and come back and not notice any change in battery life, and since I don't have to reboot, it starts up immediately.VS IPAD - As said, this isn't designed to be an iPad.  I have an iPad and there is so much more I can do with it compared to the Kindle. The Fire serves a different (but sometimes similar) function.  I just don't ever see Amazon building up the type of app store that Apple has, and that's where you're going to find the major differences. Additionally, the 10" display on the iPad makes a huge difference to me over the Fire's 7" display when it comes to watching movies and TV, and reading magazines and comic books.  However, I think there is definitely room for the Fire to steal some of iPad's market share, as many people (I am one of them), will find the functions they want in a tablet can be covered by the Fire.USER INTERFACE - The Fire uses a heavily modified version of Android.  I really liked the interface, however I don't think it works as well on the Fire as it does on a full tablet device like the Motorola Xoom.  Occasionally I would try to make a page turn and have it not register on the Fire, or have it register more slowly than I am used to.  If you have a lot of experience with the iPad, you are going to notice that the software doesn't respond as quickly on the Fire as it does with other tablets.  Although this is an inconvenience and something I definitely feel needs to be addressed, I can accept it given the lower price point.  I will have a problem though if this is not resolved through a firmware upgrade in the future.  The Fire's custom version of Android is very nice.  The most recent applications or files accessed will display in a carousel format that you can rotate through.  You can also set up commonly-used applications as favorites. If you want to access movies and pictures that you manually load onto the Fire, you have to open up the "Gallery" app, rather than accessing them from the "Videos" and "Photos" tabs.  The gallery app does not very user-friendly at displaying these files. For instance, it just creates thumbnails for all your video files and doesn't let you view the file names when selecting a video. If you have dozens of videos from a single TV show, there is no easy way to organize them in the gallery. It's clear Amazon wants you to view their videos purchased from them rather than your own. I would really like to see them fix this through a simple firmware update but I doubt they will.NEGATIVES:- No bluetooth and no HDMI.  I could really use bluetooth for integration with bluetooth-capable speakers and so I can use bluetooth audio in my car. As a media player, I feel this really should have been included, and I imagine it will with future versions.  This is especially important since the audio from the speakers is a bit tinny and weak.  I have been using headphones with all my media-playing, which significantly improves the sound. There is also no physical volume button, which is a pain when you need to silence the device quickly (EDIT: You can sideload the "Volume Control" app by RubberBigPepper" from the Android Market for a great software workaround to this).  I also would like HDMI output so I can take my Amazon video purchases and watch them on my TV.  Another big disadvantage in a device that is made for media.  This will also likely be included in a future edition, so at $200, I don't feel bad about possibly having to upgrade a year from now to get it.- Only 8Gb storage space.  As mentioned, this device is mainly designed to integrate with Amazon's Cloud, so 8 should be enough, but it would be nice to have at least 16.  I imagine Amazon did this on purpose to force people to use their Cloud service.- Touch capability can sometimes be sluggish.  iPad and other tablet owners may be disappointed with the touch reaction time and some aspects of the software.- Video doesn't include option to zoom or stretch the display to fit the screen.- Very limited selection of apps from the Amazon App Store. Most of the apps are mediocre games. UPDATE - you can get around this by manually loading apps onto the Fire. Do a search for "sideload kindle fire."  It is very easy.- Web "Accelerator" is not as fast as other tablets.- No Micro-USB transfer cable included with it.  Another way for Amazon to discourage you from transferring your own files to the device. If you want to do that, you will need to purchase one separately, like the AmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters).SUMMARY: Bottom line, you will not find a cheaper device out there for streaming music, video, and books than the Kindle Fire.  The reason that this device is so amazing is not for what it can do, but for what it can do at such a cheap price.  The price tag, not the technology, is the story here.  Although I definitely feel there is room for improvement and will be interested in seeing Amazon's second generation of this device (which I think will be significantly improved), the Kindle Fire is a solid start.  If you can wait a year or more for Amazon to work out the kinks with the Fire (like it did with its 1st generation of the Kindle), you should definitely do that. The next version should fix a lot of the problems that keep the current Fire from being a "Five Star" product.  Unfortunately, reviews shouldn't focus on price, so due to some issues with the form factor and touch interface, I can only give it four stars. It is just not "perfect" enough for me to say it is a five star product without taking price into consideration.  But aside for that, there is really only one device you can compare the Fire to - The Nook.  So for what it is, I would have no problems recommending the Fire to consumers who can take advantage of it.  This product more than lives up to what it is DESIGNED to do.  If you plan on getting most of your content from Amazon AND you have a Prime membership, I think you will really find this is a pretty incredible device for the money.UPDATE 28 Dec 2011: After getting a new case for the Fire that makes it easier to hold, I'm starting to use it more for reading (although I still prefer my Kindle Touch for anything over about 45 minutes).  Some magazines are now better adapted to the Fire liked my subscription to Wired, and some are still terrible and just compressed PDFs. An update released last week adds more privacy features so you can delete recent history form the carousel, and does improve noticeably on the touch sensitivity, although it can still be frustrating at times and not as smooth as something like an iPad.  Browser loading times are still disappointing, but not as bad as they were at first release, and I don't notice them as much.  I am continually impressed at battery usage for this device. Despite using it less than an hour a day, I never turn it off and only charge it a couple times a week.  The rest of the time it sits in standby mode which is extremely efficient.  If they could improve a couple more options I'd be closer to giving the Fire five stars.UPDATE 7 Feb 2012: I have been able to update the browser significantly by doing the following: Open up the browser and select the menu button at the bottom, select the Settings button, and then change the following options:Enable plug-ins: Change this to "off."  This will disable Flash, so if you have any web sites that need it you can re-enable it (YouTube works fine).Accelerate page loading: Uncheck this. If your wifi connection is decent, it's not really necessary.Mobile (This one is optional, but I prefer to view everything in mobile mode rather than having Silk trying to force a desktop view on a 7" screen."

Personal comparison of Kindle Fire HD, Kindle Fire, & Kindle Keyboard I purchased the Kindle Fire HD shortly after it was released in October 2012. This is my 3rd Kindle device, and yes I've kept them all for various reasons. In this review I will focus primarily on the strengths and limitations of the Kindle Fire HD, but will also point out how it compares to the "regular" Kindle Fire and the e-Ink Kindle Keyboard device. FYI, I am specifically reviewing the smaller size Kindles (not the larger 8.9" version). I love the "book size" of the smaller Kindles, they are comfortable to hold and very portable (I can just tuck it in my purse or briefcase without a problem).First of all, I must say you can't go wrong with a Kindle (any style), they are tremendous. I received my first Kindle (with the e-Ink display and buttons on the keyboard) as a gift a few Christmases ago, and initially I was actually a little skeptical about whether I'd really like it or use it. Well, in short order I found the answer was a resounding YES to both; and I was instantly hooked by all the bells & whistles offered with the Kindle Fires.Some of the best features for the Kindle Fire HD are the stunningly beautiful screen display -- the colors are rich and the picture is extremely sharp, true HD. There is also slightly less glare on this device than on the "regular" Kindle Fire, which comes in handy if you want to use your Kindle outdoors or in certain overhead lighting conditions. We use WiFi for Internet connectivity, and the Kindle Fire HD connects faster and stays connected much more reliably than the regular Kindle Fire thanks to its dual antennas. Battery life also seems slightly improved over the regular Kindle Fire. When using headphones, the audio sound is fantastic on the HD (however, it is truly nothing special without the headphones, no matter what their ads may imply). One thing to note, I checked the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD side by side: the picture quality is "great" on the regular Kindle Fire and "stunning" on the Kindle Fire HD, but the actual screen display size is in fact slightly smaller on the Kindle Fire HD (the units are the same size overall, but there's more of a "black border" on the HD version).A few comments on the ads that Amazon displays on the Kindle Fire HD: You can pay to block them, but honestly they're not that bothersome to me. Full page ads display whenever you "wake" the device (if the ad interests you then you can press for more info, but otherwise you simply swipe to unlock the screen and the ad disappears). There's also a row of ads for "Apps you might enjoy" on the Home screen. It is very easy to ignore them altogether, but on occasion I have actually been interested in a few of their suggestions and was grateful to learn about some apps I probably wouldn't have discovered otherwise.I do have a few minor critiques for the Kindle Fire HD... Even though there is a "front facing camera" included, in the "out of the box" configuration it can only be used with Skype. If you want to use it as a true camera, you'll need to purchase an app for that. It puzzles me why Amazon didn't provide true camera functionality. To date I haven't bought a camera app yet, but probably will at some point (so far the apps available are not rated very well, so I'm holding off until there's a clear "winner" out there).Another issue that I have is related to bugs with the Email interface. Searching the Kindle forums I've seen similar issues reported by many others... The problem is that I have multiple email accounts (Comcast for my primary email, and GMail for calendar purposes) associated with the device (which it supports), but periodically my Comcast mailbox stops loading. The only workaround is to uninstall/reinstall the Comcast account, which is easy enough to do, but the point is that I should not have to do that... It's a bug, and it's annoying. (Interestingly, I do not have the same issue on my "regular" Kindle Fire... I have not had a single email issue on that device ever.)In terms of accessories, I bought the "fast charger" and a bright pink Kindle case for my Kindle Fire HD. The charger does work faster than previous Kindle chargers (but you have to buy it separately; if you have an older Kindle charger it will work with the Fire HD as well, just not as quickly as the new charger does). Initially I thought the Kindle brand case was overpriced, but it seems worth it. The device fits perfectly, all of the controls are accessible, and it is designed to automatically put the Fire HD to "sleep" when you close the cover, and to "wake it" when you open the cover... There's no need to turn the unit off and on, and I enjoy the "instant on" aspect. I also love the bright pink color since it makes it easy to spot where my Kindle Fire is around the house :-)The Kindle Fires come with a 1 month trial membership to Amazon Prime. I did not become a subscriber with my original Kindle Fire, but signed up after getting the Kindle Fire HD, if for no better reason than being able to watch Downton Abbey any time I choose (it looks and sounds exquisite on the Fire HD)...  It is worth browsing Amazon Prime's selections of shows and movies to see if they interest you enough to justify the subscription cost. The 1-month trial starts the day you activate the device, so be sure to give it a try. It's worth noting that the "free 2 day" shipping benefit (with no minimum purchase) really does help offset the cost. I've used that many times this holiday shopping season!I've gotten many many hours of enjoyment from the Kindles. I must say that for pure "reading" purposes, my first e-Ink Kindle Keyboard wins hands down. The e-Ink display is easiest on the eyes and works in any lighting condition other than "dark" (there is not backlight provided). This is definitely the model you'd want for reading by a pool or on the beach... Also, its battery life is INCREDIBLE (lasts for weeks at a time). However, its web browser capabilities are extremely limited (the interface with the Amazon store works fine, but that's about it), and the Black & White display doesn't lend itself to reading magazines, photo books etc.If you want a more versatile tablet-like device, the regular Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD are both excellent choices. They offer excellent value for money... I use my Kindle Fires on a daily basis, reading email, checking Facebook, listening to downloaded music, playing Scrabble and other apps... However, what I don't do that much on the Fires is to read books very much (partly because the other features become "distractions" and partly because I sense some eye strain when reading on the Fires)... For the most part, when it's time to read a good book I'll still turn to my original Kindle Keyboard for that.One final point: The Kindles are pretty much "the best thing since sliced bread" when it comes time to packing for travel. No need to haul a stack of books and games with you: This single lightweight device can hold more books, music, photos, games, etc. than you can ever possibly need. And it fits in my purse.  :-)Kudos to Amazon for an amazing family of products. I am a VERY satisfied customer.Kindle Fire HD 7", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers

not worth exchanging for refurbished I spent $111 on a kindle that works OK but I still have to prop the cord just so or it won't charge. I also had to unregister it 3 times and reload all my apps after each start just to get 11.5 of the 16 g I was supposed to have. The tech on the phone said "Is that good enough?" Really?? I just said sure and hung up. I should have just bought a new kindle.

Easy to root, but locked bootloader This was easy to root, everything was done automatically using scripts from xda. But locked bootloader will screw you over when try to push custom on jelly bean. Locked bootloader are wrong, locked bootloaders are evil :)

I LOVE the Kindle Fire 8.9": A Detailed Review As I did with my review of the 7" version of this device, I had the chance to check out my friend's advanced copy of the 8.9" version as well. My conclusion? Simple: I LOVE this device. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!I am a former Apple fanboy; I had the iPhone, I still have the second generation iPad; but now I am finding myself expanding to other, less expensive options. I now have the Galaxy S II, and am seriously considering switching to this product. You'll find most of my comments similar to the review of the 7", with a few exceptions.DESIGN - I really like how the shortcut bar switches to the right side of the screen when you turn it to landscape mode, so you won't have to look for them. Landscape mode already uses up more vertical space so putting these buttons on the bottom in landscape mode would be silly. It's a bit weird that the home button is now on the right instead of left, but hey, that's fine with me as long as you're not using my landscape space.Attachments download pretty easily. Once you get the hang of things, you'll be using it in no time.FEEL - The fire HD 8.9 was designed very well this time around. So much easier to hold one-handed than a 10 incher or the even bigger 11.6" guys that weighs down your hand. It has a fairly large bezel which does not look so great aesthetically (I would rather have an edge to edge screen with only a tiny bezel for holding, but I'll live!) It has a soft touch back which looks very pleasant. wider bezel as I noted before, and is extremely light. It is somewhat thick - definitely thicker than the ipad, but the 8.9 version feels just right. It weighs 20 oz. so it's the heaviest product in the Amazon kindle repertoire, but it offers the most so that is expected.It is bigger than the original fire and has nice curved edges which makes it much easier to hold than the original fire. It looks very sharp!!! It has volume buttons, a MAJOR improvement on the original fire as well. It is bigger than an iPad mini and feels bigger too - while still keeping a similar price point as the regular iPad but with far more options.SOUND - the sound is clear and fantastic and comes out very crisp. The fire uses dolby digital audio which comes out very clearly. Dolby knows what they are doing. The music plays very nicely and can be stored in the cloud which is great. Amazon allows you to import up to 250 songs which is not very much, but what can you do?SOFTWARE - the device has new programs such as x-ray which is great to learn more about books and movies, and FreeTime which is fantastic for kids.The platform is Android 4.0, but this is Amazon's customized version of the platform. It is based solely to sell products so don't think of this device primarily as a iPad replacement - folks, think of it more as a faster way to line amazon's pockets with other purchases that you will almost certainly make through the device. The home screen is not customizable with widgets, live wallpapers, weather apps, etc., the way an android screen is.Immersive reading is a new feature that allows you to play an audiobook while reading the screen - you can read and listen at the same time, or if you're bored with reading, just listen. I love having the option. They do well with the sound here using the new Dolby digital feature - that is just super neat and not expected in a tablet!While x-rays for movies is super cool, I got bored of it quickly. I enjoy learning about interesting features of the movie, but after the first time, I just want to enjoy the movie.The idea of FreeTime is great for my kids. My daughter can play with her games, and I know she is not doing other things because of the bright, vibrant blue background color of the screen which I can easily ascertain with a quick glance. I can lock them down on time so they can share with each other. Most importantly, the new fire HD is built tougher.The browser runs very nicely. It seems to run faster than the original fire did. I can turn full screen on or their new "reading view" which eliminates all the background junk that wastes space. I was able to download and load PDF files and some of my word documents without any issues, and I'm told by my friend that he had no issues loading his exchange server for work on the 8.9 fire HD.Movie and book titles show up the same way the original fire did, in a library look which seems to work well for Amazon's needs. It displays your titles easily and clearly and allows you to find what you are looking for quickly. The whispersync feature was a great idea - it lets you access your content on any device, so I was able to download a book on the fire HD and see it on my original kindle fire and my iPad's kindle app. Now they have whispersync for movies, games and audiobooks as well!!!!You can use skype which works fine on wifi - it's integrated but is not as full featured as their desktop app. You can also check email - they allow access to aol, gmail, etc. Facebook is set up with the device, and you can easily view photos as well. In short, it's a pretty full featured tablet just as all the others on the market, but at a fantastic price point.HARDWARE - The 8.9" version costs $299 and $369 respectively (add $15 if you can live with special offers), as well as 32gb and 64gb ($500/$600) with LTE, plus you can get a fantastic 250mb data plan for only $50 a year on the LTE version. As my previous review noted, the 7" kindle HD comes in 16gb (only $200!!!) and 32gb for $50 more. So you are getting a pretty fantastic deal. In comparision, the 64gb version of the iPad is $659 not including the data plan, so you're saving some money on this guy. Additionally you get 5 gb of amazon cloud storage free, plus you can pay more for more cloud storage (for files: 10/20gb, $25/50gb, $50/100gb, $100/200gb, $250/500gb, and $500/1k gb, plus for music: free/250 songs, and $25/250,000 songs).The data plan, if you get the LTE version of the 8.9" fire HD, blows away the competition. Consider any smartphone you own - for instance a Galaxy S 2 - you have to pay at least $10 a month premium for the data plan alone, and this is only $50 a year! Not to mention the data plan includes 20gb cloud storage and a $10 Amazon app store credit!It has dual band wi-fi with 802.11 a/b/g/n that makes it much faster than the competition. It also has an amazing screen and dolby digital sound! It can handle WPA2, WEP and WPA security. The processor is a speedy 1.5 Ghz dual core processor with 16 gb integrated flash memory, which is almost as fast as my desktop PC... time to upgrade... :)It is a capacitive touch screen with fantastic resolution. The video playback is 720p. The device also has Bluetooth (A2DP) and HDMI port, as well as text to speech which is great for my blind friend. It comes pre-registered to my account which is a good and a bad thing. I have to be sure not to give it to anyone else without undoing that! It also has a USB 2.0 and 3.5mm stereo jack. It has an accelerometer and gyroscope and front facing HD camera with built in microphone for Skype! It also has an ambient light sensor as well which is a fantastic feature.As noted in my other review, I was able to check out the cover for the 7" (haven't seen it for the 8.9" yet) which has a nice leather grain. The interior is made of nylon which has a bit of a plasticky feel. I love the iPad 3 magnetic locking feature and they seem to have utilized that here which turns the device off (sleep) when you close it, and turns it on when you open it. Simple. Uncomplicated. I assume the cover is the same for the 8.9" version.SCREEN - They have reduced the screen glare on the device using IPS technology, a polarizing filter and anti-glare, which is pretty nice. IPS is a big deal as you don't want to be looking at it from a sharp angle and not be able to see the screen. I don't have as much trouble seeing it in direct sunlight. Also, the screen is much sharper and crisper than the original fire. I can lay the screen down flat on the table and still see what's being played pretty well. The color is vibrant and the magazines show up fantastic similar to the iPad's retina screen. It has vibrant blacks and a display resolution of 1920 x 1200 which is about 255 ppi so that does lag a bit behind the iPad with retina display.PERFORMANCE -  The HD 8.9" seems to run a bit more efficiently than the 7" version that I tested earlier, and it certainly runs much faster than my current kindle fire. It has a hardware called MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) which is increased antennas that work together to transfer data and improve data performance without taking up more unnecessary power or even adding any bandwidth to the spectrum! It uses all antennas provided to improve the connection quality as well. Not only that, the processor needed can be the same one without requiring an updated one.Downloads are pretty fast. I have Prime so I am able to run movies and shows for free and they ran fantastic on the device. On Wifi they just scream OWWWWWWW FAST. Much better than the iPad 3 as I've cross tested them. Netflix and YouTube ran seamlessly with no stuttering as sometimes happens on wireless devices like the iPad. I was able to get about 8 to 9 hours of battery life with VERY heavy usage, a bit less than the 7" version since I had the LTE running, I think they say over 11 hours but that did not happen for me. It charges pretty fast - it took only a few hours using their "powerfast" charger.ADVERTISING - The device DOES have advertising, which is displayed on the lock screen only. I found this did not bother me too much, but now Amazon allows you to pay $15 to turn this feature off. If you care so much, then you probably should not be wearing that shirt with the polo logo on it. I'm sure most of you don't and would rather spend that $15 on a new app for the device.OPENING THE BOX - It has a USB 2.0 cable and the quick start guide, as well as the tablet itself. I wish it came with the power adapter up front. I would have to go out and buy one - the iPad comes with one so why not this device? I would rather pay the extra price up front, although I guess it's better to have the option than the choice made for me. The micro-USB cable is nice for plugging it into the computer. No headphones, although I just plugged mine in from my iPad and was fine.WARRANTY - this comes with Amazon's 1 year limited warranty but you can buy a 2 year warranty as well.ACCESSORIES - You get a $3 mp3 credit with any kindle accessory you buy, so that's a bonus. You can and probably should buy two products with the device. Most importantly, pick up a powerfast charger which allows for superfast charging in only 4 hours and costs $20 which is not unreasonable. Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (for all Kindle Fire models, not included with device). I did not get a chance to see the cover for the 8.9" but I DID see it for the 7", so I assume they are very similar. You can get it here for about $55 Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9" Standing Leather Case, Fuchsia (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9") which is a bit pricey but attaches magnetically, will wake and put your iPad to sleep, and serves as a built in stand.CONS - Very minimal issues - no charger included. No microSD port. No rear camera (most have dual cams now). But let's consider these things - you save money with the absence of a charger - remember, Amazon is already selling these at cost. If you have any USB charger (most people have a smartphone so you can reuse that charger if it's USB), you'll be fine. No rear camera is fine - you aren't holding a larger device like this at all times and if you really need to take a photo, you'll have your smartphone or camera for that. The only real negative I found was the lack of a microSD port, but given that Amazon is generous with the significant memory capacity of the 8.9", this isn't a desktop replacement so you probably wont need to use up all of that storage.Conclusion - Price is great in comparison to the competition (i.e., the iPad) but you may still want to get a charger and almost certainly a case to protect your baby. Definitely a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a functional tablet and you want to be at the forefront of the technology line. I LOVED IT and recommend it!!!I hope you enjoyed this review. Please feel free to post any comments and I'll be happy to answer!***UPDATE 11-19-12 - Still loving it. I play with it every day. Noticed that the browser does predictive linking. Cool! Screen is super clear and immersive - those pixels are put to great usage and the IPS with a variety of angles is simply fantastic (although it's included with many devices, it's still a great feature for those not used to the future of tech!).  Gotta love that x-ray tech - it's so nice to download something on my kindle then switch to my phone when I dont feel like holding it, without having to redo everything. Makes life SO much easier! Amazon, you're a blessing!******UPDATE 11/23/12-have been playing with it for a few more days and i am still very happy with it. When I'm on wifi, movies load super fast and snappy, even better than the 7" version. It seems like the wifi is just much better on this model. Also, when watching movies, the sound is fantastic and crisp, due to the speakers on each side, almost like surround sound! One thing you should know is that the device does have a tendency to get a bit warm, nothing extremely unusual, pretty typical in fact but you should just be aware of that fact. Minor issue. Still love it and reccommend it!!!******UPDATE 12/17/12 - Sorry this is a bit behind the 8-ball but better late than never!!! Just so you are aware, Amazon has posted an update for the Kindle. Doesn't work on the lower end models. This is the text of the update taken from the forums: "We have a new, free software update available for Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire Second Generation. The software update will be delivered automatically via wireless to your Kindle in the coming weeks. These software updates will include: *Kindle FreeTime, a tablet experience just for kids allowing parents to set daily screen time limits, and give access to appropriate content for each child. *A setting so customers can control whether or not personalized recommendations appear below the carousel on the device homepage. *Ability for customers to set the default device language to one of six languages, including English (US), English (UK), German, French, Italian, and Spanish. We will be delivering this update over wireless connections in the coming weeks.

Chromecast- HBOGO I wish the Chromecast with HBO Go was developed  but as of right now but it isn't.  That's really the only gripe for now.

Excellent Buy Dispute a Few Problems Has it really gotten to the point where we have to upgrade our electronic gadgets every year? It was just last fall, after all, that I bought my first Kindle Fire (that's when it was launched after all). I've been addicted to it ever since, and it goes wherever I do. Or at least it did. That's because Amazon announced a refreshed line of Kindle Fires for 2012, and I knew that I had to have one.Not so much because of the fact that there was anything wrong with my trusty Kindle Fire, mind you. It was just that the new ones packed some amazing features that I knew would enhance my Kindle experience with books, videos, music, audiobooks, games, and apps.New Kindle ModelsThe classic Kindle Fire would be dropped to $159, and is a great value at that price if you are looking for a solid, entry level device. It has even been slightly improved since 2011. The new Kindle Fire HD would boast even better screen resolution and a faster processor, more memory, and better Wi-Fi for $199. It was released shortly after being introduced in late September.I, however, was holding out for the larger, 8.9" Kindle Fire that was set to be released on November 20th. This was a trade-off to be sure, as my old Kindle, at 7 inches, was not much larger than a paperback book and immensely portable for that very reason. Still, I decided that I wanted the larger model at 8.9 inch screen size.The 8.9 inch kindle Fire HD comes in several flavors. I opted for the basic model that runs $299 and has 16 GB of internal storage. The next model up will run you $70 more at $369, with the only difference being 32 GB of onboard memory. Both of these kindles are Wi-Fi only.If you want a 4G LTE model, those are available starting at $499 for a 32 GB model and $599 for a 64 GB version. Monthly data plans are available, as well. For occasional use beyond the reach of a Wi-Fi network, you can pay $49 and get 250 MB of data a month for a year. This also includes an extra 20GB of free cloud storage and a $10 credit towards the Amazon app store.It should be noted that all of the Kindle Fire models will display ads when you start up the device. This is no big deal for me, but if you want to remove that feature it will cost you another $15.Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch vs. ipad MiniAs I said, I had opted for the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model. But a funny thing happened on the way to the tablet. Apple, sensing that other makers were eating its lunch with smaller, cheaper tablets than the ipad, launched the ipad Mini before I received my new Kindle.That, I think, makes an excellent segue into an ipad Mini to Kindle Fire comparison. Obviously, at $299, the Kindle HD 8.9 inch will save you a few hundred over the ipad 3. But what about a comparison to the new ipad mini? I had a decision to make when the ipad mini was announced, especially since most of my family is already hooked on Apple and has been bugging me to convert. I had a considerable amount invested in Amazon content, though, which was a consideration. Most of it would be portable to an ipad, but the easy interface to your content that the Fire features would not be the same.For starters, the ipad Mini would cost me $30 more for a similar 16GB, Wi-Fi only model. Not so much as to make a difference, but then I started to look at the specs. First off was the display, and the Kindle clearly had the advantage over the ipad Mini. The 1920 by 1200 anti-glare display was clearly superior to the ipad's 1024 by 768 display, and of course the Kindle's screen is an inch larger. The Kindle HD also boasts a faster processor and Wi-Fi, and better speakers. The ipad mini seems to have the edge with it's camera.I decided to stick with my order for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model.The Kindle HD ArrivesEarlier I mentioned that my new kindle HD was to ship on November 20th. But as I was checking my Amazon account on the preceding Friday, I noticed that the $299 for the device had already been charged to my account. Sure enough, a quick hop over to Amazon.com indicated that the Kinddle HD had shipped the day before, and was on the UPS truck for delivery.Initial ImpressionsI was happy to get my kindle HD early, and popped it out of the box posthaste. I was immediately impressed by the larger display and new design. The device did not have the same heft as my own kindle in proportion to its size, and as a result felt less sturdy. Still, it's clear Amazon has learned from some of the mistakes they made with the original Kindle Fire.First off is the power button, which has been moved from the bottom to the top of the device. This was a major annoyance on my old Kindle Fire, as it had an alarming habit of being depressed when the tablet was held upright and trying to shut the power off.A volume control button is another welcome change; the first Kindle Fire did not have one at all. There's a new front facing camera and improved speakers on the sides of the device as well. The micro USB connection is joined by a micro HDMI output, too.One pet peeve that I have is that there is no power adapter included. While you do get a micro USB cable, this is really for connection purposes to a PC; same will not effectively charge your tablet. Actually, it's not really the omission of the power adapter that bugs me. Let's be fair, the kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a steal at $299, and you can get an Amazon "Powerfast" adapter for $19.99. It's just the plug really, and connects to the device via the included cable.My peeve, then, is that I would have liked to have known ahead of time that I needed to buy the power feed. Luckily, my old Kindle charger is compatible, but won't charge the device as quickly as the new one will. Annoyingly, Amazon changed the price to $9.99 on the adapter, but then when I went to buy one the price had changed again to $19.99 again with a $3 MP3 credit. I will hold off, I think, to see if it goes back down.My Kindle HD arrived fully charged and already configured to my Amazon account. I did need to download a software update which took about 30 minutes to fully configure and delayed my ability to start playing.Incompatible AppsWhile the power adapter omission was mildly irritating, the inability to use a number of the apps I had purchased for my Fire was downright infuriating, such to the point that I called Amazon and obtained an RMA. To be fair, most of my apps work on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. One in particular, though, that I use almost daily was incompatible when I received my tablet.The app in question is Comics by Comixology. I use this app almost daily, and have spent a considerable amount on digital comics that I and my sons read. To be unable to access these was intolerable, and I called Amazon Tech Support and e-mailed Comixology about the problem.I wasn't alone in my dismay; a number of new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet owners also posted their displeasure on Amazon and the Comixology Facebook page. It seemed amazing to me that Amazon would not correct this, since they get a cut of every comic sold through the tablet app.Fortunately, Amazon and Comixology worked to resolve the incompatibility issues and I was able to download the app the following day. Of course, you may not find my tale of woe all that disheartening, especially if you don't read comics. You should, though, be concerned about the incompatibility of apps, and I should further advise that I do have a number still that won't work. This is  not a problem that Apple has had from ipad model to ipad model.NavigationAs with the original Fire, you will find navigation is fairly intuitive, and not much has changed in the department. The home screen is where the action is at, and you can always navigate to it from any book, video, or app by tapping the screen at the bottom to retrieve the menu; then hit the home icon. It's that easy. Once there, you will notice key information displayed at the top of the screen: "alerts" about software updates, new e-mail, and even a friend's latest move in "Words With friends"; the time; Wi Fi status; and battery strength.Gone, though, is the "Gear" icon that brught you to your settings menu in the past. Instead, you need to swipe down from the top center of the screen to get to some options: you can lock and unlock your device, adjust volume, screen brightness, see and choose wireless networks, sync with Amazon, see device information, and much more.You have several ways to access your content. The home screen is presented as a row of your most recently used books, apps, videos, and websites. This is called the "carousel", and you can scroll through it with the touch of a finger. Any time you access anything in the carousel, it gets bumped to the front of the line. Again, this is much the same as the first Kindle Fire.Holding your finger on a content pane in the carousel allows you to delete it from rotation, delete it from the device, or add it to your favorites. Favorites, however, are no longer displayed on a lower "shelf" on the home screen. Instead, there's now a favorites icon in the shape of a star beneath the carousel (it's also accessible from most other areas in the device). Tapping it at any time will bring up all the content in your favorites menu.You can also access content directly by category from a menu above the carousel.  In addition to the original Kindle Fire Options of Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web, you can also choose from Shop, Games, Audiobooks, Photos, and Offers. From each of these categories, you can see content on the device and in the "cloud", and also access the Amazon store to purchase more. As with the first Fire, there is a search box on the home page and for each content category.How Much Storage Do I Need?The amount of storage that's right for you is entirely dependent upon the way you use your Kindle. At 16 GB of memory internally (only 12.8 GB of which is user accessible), I have roughly twice the storage that I had with my old Kindle Fire. Truth be told, I never used all of that, though I came close. Mostly that is because I generally access my content from the cloud. If you are not often in range of Wi-Fi and store more content locally, you may choose to opt for more storage.Managing your content and the amount of memory it consumes is simpler with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. From the settings menu, simply choose "Device" and "Storage" and you'll get a detailed analysis of your usage by content type. Tapping any of these categories will bring you to a list of that content; you can delete what you no longer want locally to increase available memory.The CloudThe Cloud allows you to store content on Amazon's servers for access through a Wi-Fi or cellular connection with compatible models of the Fire HD. The Fire HD has excellent Wi Fi detection and transfer speed capabilities, indeed even better than the ipad 3 offers thanks to the dual Wi-Fi antennas. This allows you to transfer files to your device in no time.Amazon gives anyone with an Amazon account 5 GB of storage space for free. You can use it to store documents, videos, and music for your Fire. Any music, magazines, books, and videos you purchase through Amazon do not count towards your limit. Need more space for your stuff? Amazon offers the option to buy more, the cheapest plan being $20 for an upgrade to 20 GB. Best of all, this option includes unlimited music storage. Amazon recently copied Apple's "matching" option; if they have the same music in their library that you are uploading they will automatically upgrade your tracks to 256K or better quality. There is no charge for this with one of the paid cloud plans.Available ContentAmazon has the drop on anybody else in the content category. Not even Apple comes close, except perhaps in music, but Amazon offers reduced price songs and albums that I have rarely seen on itunes. In addition, many purchases on Amazon come with promotional MP3 credits, so you can download songs as a bonus. While it's true that you can access this content through other devices, for me the integrated interface with the Kindle Fire makes them much easier to get to.While it is true that the content is not unique to this device and may seem a curious component of a review of the Kindle Fire HD, I truly believe that it is a very important factor in your decision on whether or not to buy this device or an ipad, Surface, or Nexus tablet.NewsstandAmazon offers a number of magazines and newspapers by single issue or by subscription. You can find such favorites as Time, The Economist, Forbes, Us, Popular Science, and much more.BooksAmazon has a massive library of books to choose from, most of the latest titles and lots of classics, too. Many books are free. I had a large library already from Amazon, so I was good to go with my new Fire HD. I generally keep a few on my device and store the rest in the cloud for later retrieval. As with all e-readers, I love the convenience of being able to download a book the day it is released. No trip to the store required.Also par for the course is the ability to adjust display (meaning font and print size) to your liking, though sadly the text-to-speech option that was present on the very first Kindle is still not available. Here's hoping Amazon brings it back someday.MusicThe Fire is a surprisingly good music player. Although it will never replace my Zune as my preferred music device, I do enjoy streaming music from the cloud while web surfing or playing games. As with the Kindle Fire, the Fire HD boasts an impressive little music player that streams high-quality audio to your headphones from the cloud or local storage.There are a number of apps available for music lovers as well, most of them free. Pandora, Spotify, and Iheart Radio are all available for the Fire HD.VideoStill annoying is the inability to play digital copy from my blu ray purchases. That said, there are plenty of options for video with the Fire. The Amazon video store offers a large library to select from, with much content available for rental or purchase. Any purchased content can be accessed from the cloud or the device.When renting a title, Amazon offers the convenient option of downloading to the device so that it can be accessed when Wi Fi is not available. You have 30 days to start watching; once you do the content will be deleted after a 48-hour window.DocumentsDocuments can be accessed from the cloud or the device for access as well. Quickoffice is included at no charge with your Fire HD. This comes in handy, though the files are locked for read access (though different apps allow you to alter them).You can upgrade to the full version of Quickoffice for just $15. I in fact did this shortly after purchasing my first Kindle Fire. This allows easy editing and creation of documents.AppsAmazon is not even close to offering the app content that Apple does, and likely never will. While the library of Android apps available for the Kindle has grown, it is still only a subset of those available on most dedicated Android devices (such as my cell phone). Bottom line for me, though, is that the apps catalog on Amazon suits my needs, and while I may not always be able to get an app I want, I can usually find the app I need.AudiobooksA large library of audiobooks is available through Audible.com, an Amazon company. These are my constant companions on the way to and from work, and help me to endure the traffic.WebThe Fire HD uses the Amazon Silk browser. It's intuitive, learns from the sites you visit most frequently, and starts loading them in advance on its servers when you start surfing (you can shut this off if you prefer). You can bookmark favorites, and websites look good when displayed in either mobile or normal formats. Overall, though, it's not all that different than most of the popular browsers out there.PerformanceAs with the Kindle Fire, Performance of the Kindle Fire HD has pleased me overall. Using the performance of my old Kindle Fire as a baseline, it's easy to see the improved performance on this model.Wi-FiWeb pages load more quickly than in the past with the improved Wi-Fi connectivity. Video and music stream flawlessly with a strong source as well. All the better to access your content from the cloud.Video DisplayThe display is perhaps the most impressive new aspect of the Kindle Fire HD. Video is crisp and clear, and HD movies look better than ever. Apps and games are most impressive, with some HD Apps like "Angry Birds Star Wars" appearing in glorious, sharp detail and amazingly rich, vibrant colors. Digital comics from the Comixology app truly dazzle.Books, also, are easier to read, at least for me. One of the disadvantages of the Fire line is that it lacks the e-ink of the original Kindle. That device was much like reading a conventional book with e-ink. The Fire's display was prone to impart eye fatigue for this reviewer much more quickly. Happily, with the higher resolution and improved display, this does not seem so much a problem with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet.On Screen KeyboardCertainly, the larger display of the Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet allows facilitates the use of the keyboard for e-mail and word processing much more easily. Quite simply, it's much easier to type on the screen keys with the larger display. Often, I found myself making numerous typos on my old Kindle Fire because the keys were just too small; tilting is sideways to increase size reduced my content space. Not as much of an issue with the larger Fire HD.ProcessorSo far, I haven't noticed any benefit from the faster processor. All my games and apps run pretty much as smoothly as they did on the original Kindle Fire. Perhaps that's a compliment to that device.SpeakersAnother of the features that Amazon touts as much improved are the speakers. "Exclusive Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers for crisp, booming sound without distortion"  are promised. From my standpoint? Not so much. While it's true they are slightly louder, a welcome improvement, and have a marked increase in stereo separation, they have little bass at all. I'm not really disappointed about this in such a small chassis to be fair, just don't expect to replace your boom box with the Kindle Fire HD for audio playback.Battery Life and ChargingBattery life has averaged about ten hours of assorted use (apps, books, music, videos) from a full charge. Your mileage may vary with your usage mix; apps and games devour power the most quickly. The device does take a long time to charge with my old Kindle Fire adapter (similar AC adapters can also be used).An hour's charge brought me from 5% to 40% charged; it took another two hours to fully charge my tablet.A Few New FeaturesBluetoothWorth mentioning is Bluetooth capability, not present on the original Kindle Fire. So far, I have been unable use it to play audiobooks and music through my car's speakers, though I was able to successfully pair my new Kindle to the car.CameraA front-facing HD camera is another new feature on the Kindle HD. While there is no native app for it, it does work with Skype for video calls. You can also use it with facebook to record photos and videos; there are several apps for the camera available for purchase. Picture quality and sound recording are very good, indeed, though I find that the front-facing aspect makes it difficult to take photos of things other than yourself.Amazon PrimeIn addition to the second-day shipping upgrades Amazon prime offers, you can also access a large library of movies and TV shows with your Kindle Fire HD as a member. In addition, there is a large library of books that are not otherwise free available for borrowing, one per month. Prime is, it should be noted, an additional $79 a year, and you are under no obligation to purchase it.Overall ImpressionsAlthough I still have major concerns about the incompatibility of apps, I am nonetheless very happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. Concerns remain that content I purchase now may not be available for future models. Amazon uses the perpetual access of your purchased content from the cloud as a selling point, so I would expect to be able to use it in the future.Still, the Kindle Fire HD shines in so many other areas that I can overlook this. The brilliant display, increased size, faster Wi-Fi, camera, Bluetooth, slightly better sound, all make this a truly useful one-stop entertainment device. The $299 price seals the deal.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch device truly completes the evolution of the Kindle from dedicated e-reader to multi-purpose tablet.

Excellent Buy Dispute a Few Problems Has it really gotten to the point where we have to upgrade our electronic gadgets every year? It was just last fall, after all, that I bought my first Kindle Fire (that's when it was launched after all). I've been addicted to it ever since, and it goes wherever I do. Or at least it did. That's because Amazon announced a refreshed line of Kindle Fires for 2012, and I knew that I had to have one.Not so much because of the fact that there was anything wrong with my trusty Kindle Fire, mind you. It was just that the new ones packed some amazing features that I knew would enhance my Kindle experience with books, videos, music, audiobooks, games, and apps.New Kindle ModelsThe classic Kindle Fire would be dropped to $159, and is a great value at that price if you are looking for a solid, entry level device. It has even been slightly improved since 2011. The new Kindle Fire HD would boast even better screen resolution and a faster processor, more memory, and better Wi-Fi for $199. It was released shortly after being introduced in late September.I, however, was holding out for the larger, 8.9" Kindle Fire that was set to be released on November 20th. This was a trade-off to be sure, as my old Kindle, at 7 inches, was not much larger than a paperback book and immensely portable for that very reason. Still, I decided that I wanted the larger model at 8.9 inch screen size.The 8.9 inch kindle Fire HD comes in several flavors. I opted for the basic model that runs $299 and has 16 GB of internal storage. The next model up will run you $70 more at $369, with the only difference being 32 GB of onboard memory. Both of these kindles are Wi-Fi only.If you want a 4G LTE model, those are available starting at $499 for a 32 GB model and $599 for a 64 GB version. Monthly data plans are available, as well. For occasional use beyond the reach of a Wi-Fi network, you can pay $49 and get 250 MB of data a month for a year. This also includes an extra 20GB of free cloud storage and a $10 credit towards the Amazon app store.It should be noted that all of the Kindle Fire models will display ads when you start up the device. This is no big deal for me, but if you want to remove that feature it will cost you another $15.Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch vs. ipad MiniAs I said, I had opted for the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model. But a funny thing happened on the way to the tablet. Apple, sensing that other makers were eating its lunch with smaller, cheaper tablets than the ipad, launched the ipad Mini before I received my new Kindle.That, I think, makes an excellent segue into an ipad Mini to Kindle Fire comparison. Obviously, at $299, the Kindle HD 8.9 inch will save you a few hundred over the ipad 3. But what about a comparison to the new ipad mini? I had a decision to make when the ipad mini was announced, especially since most of my family is already hooked on Apple and has been bugging me to convert. I had a considerable amount invested in Amazon content, though, which was a consideration. Most of it would be portable to an ipad, but the easy interface to your content that the Fire features would not be the same.For starters, the ipad Mini would cost me $30 more for a similar 16GB, Wi-Fi only model. Not so much as to make a difference, but then I started to look at the specs. First off was the display, and the Kindle clearly had the advantage over the ipad Mini. The 1920 by 1200 anti-glare display was clearly superior to the ipad's 1024 by 768 display, and of course the Kindle's screen is an inch larger. The Kindle HD also boasts a faster processor and Wi-Fi, and better speakers. The ipad mini seems to have the edge with it's camera.I decided to stick with my order for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model.The Kindle HD ArrivesEarlier I mentioned that my new kindle HD was to ship on November 20th. But as I was checking my Amazon account on the preceding Friday, I noticed that the $299 for the device had already been charged to my account. Sure enough, a quick hop over to Amazon.com indicated that the Kinddle HD had shipped the day before, and was on the UPS truck for delivery.Initial ImpressionsI was happy to get my kindle HD early, and popped it out of the box posthaste. I was immediately impressed by the larger display and new design. The device did not have the same heft as my own kindle in proportion to its size, and as a result felt less sturdy. Still, it's clear Amazon has learned from some of the mistakes they made with the original Kindle Fire.First off is the power button, which has been moved from the bottom to the top of the device. This was a major annoyance on my old Kindle Fire, as it had an alarming habit of being depressed when the tablet was held upright and trying to shut the power off.A volume control button is another welcome change; the first Kindle Fire did not have one at all. There's a new front facing camera and improved speakers on the sides of the device as well. The micro USB connection is joined by a micro HDMI output, too.One pet peeve that I have is that there is no power adapter included. While you do get a micro USB cable, this is really for connection purposes to a PC; same will not effectively charge your tablet. Actually, it's not really the omission of the power adapter that bugs me. Let's be fair, the kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a steal at $299, and you can get an Amazon "Powerfast" adapter for $19.99. It's just the plug really, and connects to the device via the included cable.My peeve, then, is that I would have liked to have known ahead of time that I needed to buy the power feed. Luckily, my old Kindle charger is compatible, but won't charge the device as quickly as the new one will. Annoyingly, Amazon changed the price to $9.99 on the adapter, but then when I went to buy one the price had changed again to $19.99 again with a $3 MP3 credit. I will hold off, I think, to see if it goes back down.My Kindle HD arrived fully charged and already configured to my Amazon account. I did need to download a software update which took about 30 minutes to fully configure and delayed my ability to start playing.Incompatible AppsWhile the power adapter omission was mildly irritating, the inability to use a number of the apps I had purchased for my Fire was downright infuriating, such to the point that I called Amazon and obtained an RMA. To be fair, most of my apps work on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. One in particular, though, that I use almost daily was incompatible when I received my tablet.The app in question is Comics by Comixology. I use this app almost daily, and have spent a considerable amount on digital comics that I and my sons read. To be unable to access these was intolerable, and I called Amazon Tech Support and e-mailed Comixology about the problem.I wasn't alone in my dismay; a number of new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet owners also posted their displeasure on Amazon and the Comixology Facebook page. It seemed amazing to me that Amazon would not correct this, since they get a cut of every comic sold through the tablet app.Fortunately, Amazon and Comixology worked to resolve the incompatibility issues and I was able to download the app the following day. Of course, you may not find my tale of woe all that disheartening, especially if you don't read comics. You should, though, be concerned about the incompatibility of apps, and I should further advise that I do have a number still that won't work. This is  not a problem that Apple has had from ipad model to ipad model.NavigationAs with the original Fire, you will find navigation is fairly intuitive, and not much has changed in the department. The home screen is where the action is at, and you can always navigate to it from any book, video, or app by tapping the screen at the bottom to retrieve the menu; then hit the home icon. It's that easy. Once there, you will notice key information displayed at the top of the screen: "alerts" about software updates, new e-mail, and even a friend's latest move in "Words With friends"; the time; Wi Fi status; and battery strength.Gone, though, is the "Gear" icon that brught you to your settings menu in the past. Instead, you need to swipe down from the top center of the screen to get to some options: you can lock and unlock your device, adjust volume, screen brightness, see and choose wireless networks, sync with Amazon, see device information, and much more.You have several ways to access your content. The home screen is presented as a row of your most recently used books, apps, videos, and websites. This is called the "carousel", and you can scroll through it with the touch of a finger. Any time you access anything in the carousel, it gets bumped to the front of the line. Again, this is much the same as the first Kindle Fire.Holding your finger on a content pane in the carousel allows you to delete it from rotation, delete it from the device, or add it to your favorites. Favorites, however, are no longer displayed on a lower "shelf" on the home screen. Instead, there's now a favorites icon in the shape of a star beneath the carousel (it's also accessible from most other areas in the device). Tapping it at any time will bring up all the content in your favorites menu.You can also access content directly by category from a menu above the carousel.  In addition to the original Kindle Fire Options of Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web, you can also choose from Shop, Games, Audiobooks, Photos, and Offers. From each of these categories, you can see content on the device and in the "cloud", and also access the Amazon store to purchase more. As with the first Fire, there is a search box on the home page and for each content category.How Much Storage Do I Need?The amount of storage that's right for you is entirely dependent upon the way you use your Kindle. At 16 GB of memory internally (only 12.8 GB of which is user accessible), I have roughly twice the storage that I had with my old Kindle Fire. Truth be told, I never used all of that, though I came close. Mostly that is because I generally access my content from the cloud. If you are not often in range of Wi-Fi and store more content locally, you may choose to opt for more storage.Managing your content and the amount of memory it consumes is simpler with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. From the settings menu, simply choose "Device" and "Storage" and you'll get a detailed analysis of your usage by content type.

The Fire HD has excellent Wi Fi detection and transfer speed capabilities, indeed even better than the ipad 3 offers thanks to the dual Wi-Fi antennas. This allows you to transfer files to your device in no time.Amazon gives anyone with an Amazon account 5 GB of storage space for free. You can use it to store documents, videos, and music for your Fire. Any music, magazines, books, and videos you purchase through Amazon do not count towards your limit. Need more space for your stuff? Amazon offers the option to buy more, the cheapest plan being $20 for an upgrade to 20 GB. Best of all, this option includes unlimited music storage.

GORGEOUS and FAST! I'm no tablet novice. Had a Dell Streak 7 when it first came out. I also own a Galaxy Note 2.  So I know expensive and high end -- and THIS baby proves that price and brand matters not!It DOES come with Google Play Store.  The screen is CRYSTAL CLEAR and SUPER bright. Touch sensitive. Internet fast. Design sleek and as sturdy as any expensive brand.Despite a 2 hour battery life (which isn't a deal breaker because anything more, and you may as well use a laptop -- its a TABLET, not a PC -- but you can download the "Easy Battery Saver" app), it still deserves 5 stars. This manufacturer has a competitive advantage if consumers catch on and for HALF the price of leading brands!LOVE IT!Update 3/2/14: Still going strong. Not sure why so many bad reviews in recent weeks, but it DOES appear that the product has changed drastically from an aesthetic standpoint.  Mine is white/silver and looks kind of like a rectangular Ipad. Maybe that's the problem.

Buyer beware! First let me say ...I have read other reviews in the past for other products where people have ended up with a lemon and couldn't get support from the manufacturer. Often those reviews are pretty spiteful and biased against the manufacturer. My goal here is to not be spiteful or biased. I want to help others considering purchasing this product make an informed decision.I purchased this tablet and it quit charging after 2 - 3 days. I understand that there are problems from time-to-time with an individual product that are not necessarily indicative of the entire product line. Therefore when I contacted the company I was quite reasonable in expressing my desire to return the broken tablet. I tried explaining as clearly as I could the problem I was having.  2 months later I still cannot return the tablet. Essentially I now own a $200 paperweight. Since the company is in China and I am in the U.S. there really isn't much I can do about it. They will not give me any information on how to return it or any assurances that they will replace the defective tablet or return my money.Overall, for the 2 days I was able to use the tablet it seemed quick and responsive. Video was smooth and the interface was typical of an Android device. The play store was included - some tablets do not include the play store so I was glad that this one did.I was disappointed to discover that there was no Bluetooth even though the manufacture's website (zenithink.com) clearly said it did. This is a major drawback for me and the main reason I bought the tablet since I had plans for using it while playing my guitar connected to a Bluetooth pedal for displaying music.The battery was extremely disappointing - it lasted 3 hours max in standby. I can understand 3 hours at full use but 3 hours in standby seems unreasonable to me. It is possible that the charger was not fully charging the tablet but the software indicated that the battery was fully charged.The charger plugin jack is precarious and a most definite weak point. It sticks out as if it hasn't been plugged in all the way. It is also very flimsy and I am sure prone to easily break.Any good about this tablet is outweighed by the quasi-support I received. I did get response from support but they offered no real solutions and when I expressed my desire to return an obviously defective tablet they quit responding completely. I was well within the return period stated in their terms. It is apparent that they do not like returns regardless of whether the tablet is defective or not.I would caution anyone considering this product to beware that if you have problems you may not be able to return the tablet or get any kind of real support. in hindsight I would rather have paid double the price from a trustworthy company that supports their product.UPDATE**********After writing this review I decided to try and fix the tablet myself. I took it apart and found the charging jack inside the tablet was broken. I re-soldiered it and put the tablet back together. Now the tablet is working fine. The battery is lasting much longer now which makes sense since it probably wasn't able to fully charge before. Overall it is a fast tablet that works well.Still without good customer support I cannot recommend this tablet since the average user will not be able to fix a broken tablet from the factory as I did. It is unreasonable and ridiculous that this tablet company would not offer help for their defective product.UPDATE 6 months later **********Tablet is still working. Screen is not as responsive as it was. Sometimes the screen goes crazy and starts randomly opening apps. I have to shut off the screen and turn it on again to stop it from doing this. I think this mostly happens when the battery is low. The battery lasts a surprisingly long time. At least when I compare it to what it was doing when I first got it. The battery level indicator always shows as charging even I it is unplugged. Also the indicator jumps around a lot. It will say 90% full and then a few minutes later it might say 40%. I can never trust what the battery level indicator says which makes it hard to know when to charge. There is a tiny white spot in the middle of the screen showing up now. Looks like a small defect. It doesn't really bother me though. The charger went bad - probably because of how flimsy it is. I tried to order a new one but the one I got didn't fit right. I found on my original charger that one of the wires in the charging tip broke inside the plastic housing. I cut off the plastic and re-soldiered the connection and now it works okay. Overall I feel like I have been able to turn a lemon into lemonade. Still I wouldn't recommend this product, at least not without getting a soldiering iron as well :)

Adjust your expectations If you look at this as a cheap tablet that has basic functions, it does exactly what it sets out to do.  it is already rooted.  Ready to use right from opening the package.  If you are looking for bells and whistles, you will be disappointed.

not good quality I purchased this tablet to take to the Grand Canyon.  What a waste of money.  the pictures and the video quality was terrible.  the color on the tablet of the pictures were washed out.  these were the worest picture quality that I have every taken.  Don't waste your money.  I am going to request a full refund.  This product should not be sold to the public.  Shame on this company.

Nice tablet for use at home I purchased this tablet thinking it had a sim slot, when it came in it did not.  It was ok to use wherever there is wifi and at home. Mostly used in the car as a music player thru my radio. a little slow at times and gets stuck on some screens, but for less than $100 hey why not..I will end up giving it to my nephew to use around the house..

Thin and Light! Very Smart! First off I would like to clarify that this a full blown x86 machine running full Windows 8 and it's only limited by it's hardware, it runs all legacy programs as well as Windows store apps, this is a PC that looks and feels like a tablet and for me that is excellent. Also this is not a Windows 8 review.Now that we got that out of the way, on to the review.This is a long review but I hope is useful if you're on the fence about this tablet or a Windows 8 tablet in general, I will point out some aspects I would've liked to know before I purchased this tablet as it may be helpful to you too, please read on.HARDWARE AND BUILD-----------------------------*You can read the full specs on the product description-It has almost the same footprint as an IPad and the weight is very comfortable without making it feel cheap, even with a case on this tablet weights less than 1.5 lbs. Actual weight is 1.3 lbs which is very nice. Mine came with a light creaking on the right side (landscape orientation) of the bezel but not a mayor issue-The Screen is superb for what it is(1366x768 IPS display), viewing angles are on par with an IPad and better than on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, crisp and clear images are produced and colors a very accurate, it also has adaptive brightness. Screen response is very fast and it has full Windows touch support and 5 point multi-touch support also  it has no active Wacom pen support-The Back panel has a rubbery feel to it makes it feel more expensive  and it does not attract fingerprints nor it scratches easily, also the camera decoration ring gives it an upscale look-Only one speaker is built in, not stereo speakers like advertised, this is  really my only hardware compliant, it is really quiet and puny, but I kind of expected that. Since it has a combo mic/headphone jack and Bluetooth 4.0 and the output trough the jack is very good getting audio out of this thing is no problem, you will need an adapter for separate microphone and headphone use, also I've found that the Intel sound driver has a weird way of recognizing when you plug in something and it sometimes kills the audio completely and you have to restart the tablet, this appears to be more of a bug than problems with the actual hardware,-The battery is non removable and is superb for a full Windows 8 machine, I've managed to get about 9 hours out of a charge using Bluetooth, WiFi and running several apps-The back camera is very good, it takes full 8 megapixel stills and records 1080p videos, front camera has a wide lens though is off centered, it looks weird but it makes sense for video calling-NFC and GPS are supported, you may share websites and contact cards with most NFC enabled devices but keep in mind that file transfers are restricted between Windows 8 products only (Includes RT and Windows Phone 8), this is a "security feature" in Windows 8 (Dam you Microsoft!)-The wireless antenna is very good but it will not connect to ad-hoc networks(like the ones created by some smartphones) and creating a WiFi hotspot is not supported,  these are "security features" in Windows 8 (Dam you again Microsoft!), you can install a third party app for WiFi hotspots creation but is not working for me yet-Bluetooth audio and remote control are supported as well as Dial Up Networking via Bluetooth and Nokia Suite in my case (solves my ad-hoc problem), audio streams with no problems, as well as the internet connection via DUN, fast enough-Charging requires at least 1.5 amps output from your power supply (if not using the supplied one) for a slow charge, don't expect it will charge off from your regular USB port on your computer these put out 0.5 amps at most, by the way the USB to Micro-USB cable for charging that is included is very short (like 3 ft.), you can use an equal longer cable-Haven't tried out the Micro-USB OTG feature and the Micro-HDMI port yet,I will be updating this review when I get some adapters, the Micro-SDXC port supports up to a theoretical 2 TB of storage, mine is 64 GB no issuesOverall very good hardware, build and finish is well executed and materials feel more expensive.PERFORMANCE/STABILITY-----------------------------This tablet flies on Windows 8 it opens apps and desktop programs(depending on the program) very fast is responsive and it handles multitasking quite well, stability is not an issue, had one freeze up during a Windows update but it resumed quickly, the Modern UI feels perfect for this hardware spec, the desktop side will depend on what you are running.This tablet has a Dual-Core Intel Atom z2760 @ 1.8 GHz and 2 GB of Ram @ 800 MHz, an integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator with a minimum of 64 MB and a maximum of 725 MB of shared memory and Direct x 9.3 installed and an on-board Intel STT Audio Device (WDM) with an eMMC 64 GB (~58 GB formatted) HDD.Windows Experience Index (Windows 8 32-Bit)Processor: 3.4Memory: 4.7Graphics: 3.7Gaming Graphics: 3.2Primary Hard Disk: 5.8That is good for the following(some examples):-All Windows Store Apps-MS Office and many document suites-High quality Video/Audio playback and streaming (YouTube Full HD, Netflix, Hulu, Spotify Premium, Sony Music Unlimited, Full HD video files and looseless audio formats)-Light Audio/Video and Photo Editing (Very light)-Some older games(Age of Empires 3, World of Warcraft on lowest settings, Fallout, Emulators topping on Gamecube/PS2-like graphics)-Some CAD programs and Audio creation programs (MathCAD, AutoCAD, Amplitube or Guitar Rig)-Some programming and SQL programs (MS SQL Server, MS Access, NetBeans,Flash Builder,etc)Basically anything that is not too CPU or Graphic intensiveHaven't tried virtualization yet(OracleVM for example), Windows 8 reports it's not supported by the processor but it may be configurable I'm not sure, also you can install Bluestacks or WindowsAdroid if you like to install some Android apps and since it's a x86 machine there's a possibility to put Mac OS X or Ubuntu on this thing.Overall very good performance for every day computing, as well as some leg room for big programs, very pleased.INCLUDED SOFTWARE AND ACCESSORIES------------------------------------------It includes the bare-bone accessories, only the charger cable, power supply and a cleaning cloth are included, as well as manuals and warranty info.Asus choose to include as little bloatware as possible, this is good, they just included their LiveUpdate, WebStorage, MS Office trial install and some windows modern apps, also they included the restore partition which you can back-up to an external USB drive and delete after if you want to get those 8 GB backOverall pasable software an accessory bundle, software wise is good since it doesn't rob me of my precious space, but accessory wise they should have included a Micro-USB OTG adapter and perhaps a cloth sleeve for travel. Also I would suggest getting a Bluetooth keyboard and a mouse since it makes things better on the desktop mode, in fact the more things you can use connecting Bluetooth or WiFi the better since the Micro-USB port doesn't seem to put out too much power and carrying around a USB hub (aside from the fact that the tablet probably is not going to be able to power your devices or even the hub itself) defeats the purpose of portability.CONCLUSION----------------------It starts at $499.99 for 64 GB (mine costed $487.99) and that gives you most of the power of a regular PC plus expandable storage in an tablet package, by the way speaking of tablets both the IPad 4 and the Nexus 10 are the same price and offer better displays and arguably better ease of use, minus less storage and no real PC capabilities. For me those tablets don't fit my needs like this one does because it has Windows.By no means is this tablet a "anything-killer", each tablet fits different needs and does it in a different fashion, so this is rather a completely different beast, a new genre of tablets, this tablet is a great start to getting your Windows 8 groove on, highly recommended great product.Look for options and do the research  to know if a certain tablet fits your needs and then go from there, for me it's finally what I was looking for in tablet, a portable full blown computer.

all in all a good tablet This tablet is very good for your money. You can spend more on a tablet like a nexus and it will be faster but you also get things from the XYboard that you would not get on others. It has an HDMI port on it which is really nice to have. It also has a sim card slot but no micro sd card slot. The battrey life is 2.5 to 3 hours o constant use with the screen brightness all the way down.  It is great for watching movies on and that sort of stuff. I would recommend it to a friend.The only negatives of this tablet are it is fairly slow, slower than my phone and if an app goes for too long or your browsing reddit for about an hour it will force close

Best I've Tried - A Keeper! I have tried all the major Android tablets and have owned an iPad 2, 3 and 4.  I have never been happy with any of them.  They all had shortcomings...until now.  I ordered the Nexus 10 after convincing myself that it looked and sounded like what it was I really found important and wanted in a tablet.  Boy!  I was not wrong.  I have been using the Nexus 10 for a couple of weeks now and can report that this tablet is fantastic in every way.  The screen is quite remarkable.  It is fast!Also, it has the best keyboard and touch that I have found on any of those other tablets.  The Pad-thing could learn something here...and I am sure they will probably update its keyboard since that is one of the big trouble spots I found with my iPad 2,3, and 4.  The newest android system is quite easy to get around...and, did I say this was fast?????  I mean smoking fast.  Others have said the iPad has nothing to worry about from the Nexus....really?  Give it time.I use my Nexus for productive (school) uses, surfing the Internet, email and social media.  I love, love, love this tablet.  I bought the 32 due to restrictive expansion (sounds familiar doesn't it?).  If you're in the market...please consider checking out the Nexus.  I bought a "refurb" unit that was fulfilled by Amazon for a really decent price and it looks brand spanking new (probably really is).  Also purchased a magnetic cover and screen protector that was easy to install...just followed directions.  Total package = excellent.UPDATE:  6/8/13I was wrong.  My initial feelings and vibes reported above were a bit premature.  My patience was put to the test this week, and, as of today, the Nexus 10 is going back.  This entire week, the Nexus 10 started acting "funny".  It was surprisingly sluggish - much more than when I first got it, and I didn't add but a couple of apps that were pretty lame and should not have impacted performance.  Then I started getting the lock-ups which needed the hard reboots that a lot of folks talk about.  Finally, today, even when using Chrome (Google's own search engine!), things just would not load...at all.  I tried using Dolphin and still nothing.  Enough is enough.  Between the slow responses, hard reboots required daily, and now search engine issues when I try to surf anywhere - I am calling it quits on the Nexus...white flag is going up the pole.  I am very disappointed as I really did think this was "the one"!  I still think that once the bugs get worked out, I will be all in since I just loved this machine.  The feel, the looks, the keyboard, the interface....the entire package was great, but the frustrating features were too much and I can't tolerate such things.  Google just needs to get it right and this tablet will kick some serious butt all over the place.

It works! Its a typical tablet, I have had some issues with the sleep mode. Sometimes it would freeze when I wake it up, but then restarts itself.

Solid, First-Rate Performance, and an Excellent Value I'm writing this review on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9" right now, stylus in hand, testing things out, making sure that things all work as they should.  Had thought about writing the entire review with this device, but the more I get into it, don't think that I can do it justice this way, so I'll just make my notes here as I go, then save them to the Amazon Cloud.Of the four different Kindle Fire HD 8.9" models available at the time of this review, I picked the one that would best fit my personal needs. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB was chosen based on prior experience with the first generation Kindle Fire, as I had found no problems whatsoever with Wi-Fi in my area, either in the home or within the establishments that I visit. Picked the model that includes special offers, as personally they don't bother me a bit.Breaking this down into sections, I'll offer a subjective overview of what's good and not so good, followed by more details.Likes:+ Excellent display; very easy on the eyes, good access to Amazon and to the `Net+ High resolution; 1920x1200 HD display, rich color from all viewing angles+ Strong Wi-Fi connectivity; dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi, fast downloads & video streaming+ Exceptional sound quality; offers true Dolby Surround Sound+ Long battery life; over 10 hours average, measured and confirmed+ No setup needed; ready to go and runs right out of the box+ Built-in micro HDMI port; allows for 1080P to be streamed to the TV+ Prime Instant Videos; unlimited, and so many from which to pick+ Excellent product feel; very solid and comfortable to the hand+ 16GB storage; about 12.7GB available to the user, more on the Cloud+ Good clean styling; minimalist, yet highly functionalDislikes:- No charging indicator light/LED as on 1st generation Kindle Fire- No charger; it could have been factored into the base priceFirst Impressions:Amazon isn't kidding when they offer fast delivery on the new Kindle Fire models. Mine was received within 36 hours from time of ordering, and the minimalist packaging is quite good, with the USB cable stowed in the box lid. Ordered it with the charger, though I already had one from earlier, and immediately charged it even though it comes partially charged. Setup is minimal, making it all so easy. Once it was fully charged, took it online and immediately installed the Battery HD Pro app and ran the full calibration routine as suggested, just as I had done last summer with the original Kindle Fire; this one is highly recommended.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9" came preloaded with content already purchased before. The Home screen offers a search bar at the top, with additional groupings below: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, etc. Additional groupings will show up when it's held in landscape mode. Below these there's a carousel of recently viewed material, be it a book, app, web page, movie, etc.Exploring the new Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, it was apparent that this unit is no simple upgrade over the original. The larger 1920x1200 HD display is clearly sharper, compared to 1024 x 600 on my original 7-inch Kindle Fire, and the reduced screen glare is immediately apparent, probably due to its built-in polarizing filter. The colors were deeper and more intense, with darker blacks and even at varied viewing angles. The 1920?1200 HD also helps make text crisp and sharp, and reading books and magazines is a pleasure.The real test came when I tried uploading some ultra-sharp high resolution JPG photos, and was quite pleased at how well they were rendered on the screen. The display on this Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is rated at a very dense 254 pixels per inch (ppi), making it excellent with the 300 & 600 ppi photos that I had uploaded. Tried a few HD videos as well, and the more vivid colors and deeper blacks were apparent, again even at different viewing angles, a step up from my original Kindle Fire.Hardware:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9" has a good look and feel. It's actually quite a minimalist device, and is easy to hold even without a case. Measuring slightly less than 9? x 6? inches and only 0.35 inch thick, it has beveled edges, which make it feel even thinner. Weighing in at 20 ounces, it has a solid feel, and the screen surface feels quite robust. Some sources have noted that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass, which may account for the solid feel, but that remains to be verified. The power button is a simple pushbutton, which is nearly flush with the device; no snags here.Wi-Fi Connectivity:As noted earlier, I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9" that is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity because of earlier experiences with the original Kindle Fire. What I found with this new one was surprising. The product description claims that it offers "over 40% faster speeds" due to the dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. Where I live there's plenty of connectivity, but it can dip or stutter now and then. This newer Kindle Fire HD is said to be able to switch automatically between the more congested 2.4 GHz and less congested 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies, and I've experienced a longer range and faster overall speed, so it works.Processor & Storage:I never had issues with the performance of the original, but this Kindle Fire HD really does perform faster.  It's probably the combination between its newer dual-core 1.5 GHz TI OMAP4 4470 processor and the improved Imagination SGX544 3D graphics core, but there's a noticeable difference, both in speed and graphics rendering. Videos are smoother and far snappier. As far as storage goes, I picked the 16 GB version as I do not accumulate as much as others. Most of the items stored here are books, magazines, photos, some videos and MP3 music files. The Amazon Cloud is where much of my content is kept, and after a book is read, it goes back there for storage so that it can be pulled when need. Keeps things simple and accessible over multiple devices.Web Browsing:The newest version of Amazon Silk works well on this device and offers faster page loads than previous versions. But one of the first things that I did was to switch the default search to Google. It's a personal thing, easy to do, and it allows me to search just as I would on my Windows PCs and on my MacBook Pro. It's fast, easy, familiar and far less hassle that way. Luckily this Kindle Fire HD makes it easy to do in the settings, and it just takes a few seconds of exploring to do it.There is Facebook integration as well, and you can import your photos from Facebook to your Amazon Cloud Drive and view them there, along with any other photos you may already have placed in your Cloud Drive. But a word of caution here: if importing your images directly from Facebook, you're cannot specify which photos you want to import; you'll end up importing them all. Just be aware of this before you start.Email & Address Book:Email setup was a breeze. I use Gmail as my primary, and it was set up and configured within seconds. Once that was setup, the Gmail address book was simple and smooth, and no problems encountered. The larger screen on this device makes it a breeze to access Gmail, read messages and to reply to them.Accessing Apps:There are a number of apps that I use from Amazon's Appstore for Android, and was most curious to see how these would function on the new device. There's a "Compatibility with your devices" checkbox in the upper right of each app, and if it's designed to function on the Kindle Fire HD, there's a green checkbox. Most of the apps that I use have to do with news, travel, photo imaging, word processing, music and utilities. There are a few that won't work on the new device, yet with all of the choices in the Appstore, have yet to find a number of apps to fit my needs. Many of them offer a test drive so that you can decide if it works for you.I'm the wrong one to comment on game performance, as there are very few that I've even tried. The few that I've installed to see what the experience was like seemed to perform well, but not being a gamer, my opinions would be almost worthless.In the Clouds:I've found the Amazon Cloud Drive to be invaluable for storage, and quite easy to use as my freebie backup for books, magazines and apps. But it can also be used to back up documents, photos, videos and other digital files. This review was initially stored on the Amazon Cloud when it was being written, and from there downloaded to my PC for final edits. There's a free desktop app that one can download for access and connection to the Amazon Cloud that makes life easy, and it works well.But my main cloud storage for general use on my PCs and MacBook Pro is the Google Drive, and I looked for an app to install it, but it didn't exist in the Amazon Appstore. There are workarounds, but I hate wasting time hacking apps and interfaces, so I dug deeper... and it was there, in my Gmail settings, along with my address book and the Google+ access. Simple, no hassles, and it works.Sound Quality:Didn't know how well the tiny stereo speakers would work on this version of the Kindle Fire HD would work, but it's said to offer Dolby Digital Plus, and that they were tuned to better reproduce low, bass notes, and without distortion. So I tested it using a particular track that I've used before: Strauss: Introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, also known as the Theme from 2001, A Space Odyssey. This particular pure digital (DDD) track has the full dynamics that can bring your speakers to their knees. Without getting too deep here, the opening ultra low notes could be heard, and the kittle drums were surprisingly clear.This also held up quite well with a couple more music tracks, some films and videos that I watched. Distortion is truly minimal, and there is a slightly different though quite good sound when headphones or external speakers are plugged in. Over it's quite better with stereo sound than anticipated.Bluetooth:Setting up Bluetooth was very easy. I paired it with the Plantronics Voyager Legend headset as an audio alternative and tested it with Skype for future use. No problems encountered, and the audio quality was quite good.Reading Books & Magazines:There's no doubt that the 1920x1200 HD display adds to the enjoyment of reading books and magazines, and the sharper text is very easy on the eyes, especially late at night when one is tired. With the X-Ray for Books feature, you can easily get more info about characters, locations, terms, and historical figures mentioned in a Kindle book, and it also highlights exactly where in the book those details are mentioned, allowing you the ability to jump right to the appropriate page. It also allows you to get biographies and more from Wikipedia and Shelfari.Gripes/Complaints:There's no such thing as a perfect product, and in that this Kindle Fire HD 8.9" isn't alone. My older 1st generation Kindle Fire has a charging indicator LED built into the power button, and I was surprised to see the lack of the same on this newer product. Let's just call it an irritant. The other gripe is that there was no charger included as there was with the original Kindle Fire, and a decent charger is essential for this device. As of this writing you can get the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger for about half price, but only if it's ordered at the same time as the Kindle Fire HD, so if you're considering one of these, be sure to order it at the same time.Accessories & Cases:Though the device offers a 10-point multi-touch interface, which is quite good and far superior to the earlier interface from the original Kindle Fire, I've reverted to old habits and use a amPen New Hybrid Stylus for most applications. This one is quite responsive on the screen, and for some of us it's a faster way of working.Also picked up the Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9" based on past experience with a smaller one for the original Kindle Fire. This is a solid 4-star product, but the more costly Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9", which is made from genuine leather lined with soft microfiber interior, may be a better and more functional choice for many. These are just two among the many to be found here; the choices are yours.Summary:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a solid product, easily worthy of a +4.5 star rating, considering the minor complaints that I've noted above. It has proven to be subjectively the perfect choice for my needs, though yours may vary, and the 4G versions may better suit your needs. The Wi-Fi performance has showed itself to be better than expected, the navigation is quicker than earlier versions, and the higher-resolution screen does a better job displaying menu options. To date I've had no crashed or lockups. It's currently largest tablet Amazon makes at the moment, and it gives you access to all of your Amazon content in high definition. As a multimedia device it has proven to be quite good, and considering how vast Amazon's content offerings are, especially if you're a Prime member, this is probably one of the best media consumption tablets on the market today, and certainly one of the most affordable in its class.12/23/2012

Chromecast- HBOGO I wish the Chromecast with HBO Go was developed  but as of right now but it isn't.  That's really the only gripe for now.

Nook HD is a good tablet The Nook HD is a very good 7" tablet.  The screen is great.  With Google Play, you can download apps easily.  The only drawback that I've encountered is that apps can't be sideloaded because of the customized Android OS.  You can make it a true Android tablet with a N2A card that can be purchased on the internet.

Kid safe? Vrs Nabi 2 Vrs Coby Kyros EMATIC FUNTABI bought this tablet for my 2 year old daughter. I set it up prior to giving it to her. It was fairly simple. Switching screens from kid mode to mommy mode is a little confusing at first. I found myself " lost " a few times. The preloaded apps are nice, and it was fairly simple to put everything else I wanted on it. Which wasn't much, considering the age of my daughter.  The tablet is fast, but dropped wifi a few times. Over all I didn't have any problems with it.It doesn't come with a case, but it has grips on either side that are a nice addition.Kid safe? Nope. Screen broke in a couple of weeks. The glass and the LCD both shattered. The glass and the LCD broke from a 1 1/2 foot drop onto plush carpet. The point of impact was the upper right hand corner, it shattered clear across the screen.I didn't buy this tablet from amazon, and the place I bought it from didn't fulfill the warranty. This isn't the tablets fault obviously, but beware of that if you buy it some place else.  I emailed ematic (3 times) to see if they could fix it for a charge, or if it was covered by some sort of manufactures warranty. It's been a few months and I'm still waiting for a response. Talking to a local shop that repairs screens, they quoted 95$. I paid $50.00 for this tablet the day after thanksgiving.The price of this tablet is great. I'm not sure why the blue is so much more than the pink though.Other than the broken screen, which happens, this is a nice tablet for a child.*******************************************************Nabi 2I bought this tablet (nabi 2) for my 3 year old son. I set it up prior to giving it to him. Set up was easy, " mommy mode " is brilliant. The tablet is fast and reliable. I had zero problems with movies and apps. I was able to upload every app I wanted too and make it " perfect " in a few hours.One thing I didn't like was that some apps can't be removed from the child screen, and they need to be purchased to play past the trial. The child can't accidental buy anything, but it caused a couple of head aches.The case is thick and easy to grip. We received the alphabet pack as a free gift when we ordered it. Those are also great, my son really enjoyed them.***Kid safe? Not a chance. The screen was broke with in a week. The glass and the LCD broke when my son was playing with the preloaded drum set app. He was hitting the screen with his fingers, having a crazy amount of fun... until it broke. He wasn't hitting it very hard, but apparently hard enough. Nabi will replace the screen for around $80.00, if you don't have a warranty to cover the cost.I read rave reviews for this tablet before I purchased it, perhaps ours was just unlucky.***********************************************************My children are obviously young, they are just starting out with electronics. They were supervised while playing with both the Nabi and funtab. There was no abuse, or rough play with them. They didn't have them long enough for rough play. They broke from pure accidents. An older child might not have the same issues we had with the screens at all.I waited for my son to get a little older and gave him my old Coby Kyros 9.7 inch to play with. It's been six months and the screen is still intact. It was fairly easy to child proof. We don't have a problem with him clicking adds, going to any website let alone an inappropriate one, or buying anything. I simply blocked the Wifi and browsers. He hasn't found his way into the settings or anything like that. (yet) Its far to slow for me, but to use it for the things my son likes to do ( movies, learning apps, low graphic games) it's pretty great.Over all, no tablet is kid safe. No magic screen that won't break. Both kid tablets had in app purchases I couldn't hide. Even if the screens didn't break on the first two tablets, I didn't find anything so special about "mommy mode" to pay the extra money for it.

Nexus 7 Updated Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google "Meenova.com" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google "Install Flash On Nexus 7"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like "do I need an umbrella today?" Ask "Weather forecast (your location)."Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri "what are you wearing" gets her to say "Why do people keep asking me that?" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the "NAvFree USA" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying "in 100 meters, turn right." My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan.

Great little device! I just got this little jewel two days ago. I had a nook that was fine, but when my main computer had issues, I ditched it and got a wireless printer and this. So far s good.

Slow and weak but affordable You can get the Simbans little honest-to-goodness 7" Android tablet for about the price of a PS3 or Xbox video game but... is it worth that much when a vastly superior, last year's vintage Kindle Fire HD (yes, not 'pure' Android) or a Nexus 7 could be had for the price of 2-3 video games? The makers of Simbans believe it is so and, to prove it, they provided me with a 'for review' unit so that I can see it for myself and write about it. I am not fully convinced.To start with the 'goods', yes, this Android 4.2 tablet does handle games and the various Google apps without crashing. I was able to play Temple Run, for example and I was able to survive for the first few hundred meters even though the frame rate was not the smoothest. Netflix... barely, It showed me the first 5 minutes or so of a movie, then went into 'buffering' mode and stayed there until the battery ran out. The camera does take pictures and it even supports Android's 360-degree camera mode but the resolution is low and the response to touch could be better.But I'm getting a little ahead of myself because I'm talking about the good features right now so, before I lose focus, let me make a case of why anyone would want to consider purchasing this product.- Inexpensive: I may be wrong but I don't believe that you can get a tablet (not a joke) that actually works for this little money.- Pure Android: unlike the Kindle Fire so, if you know and love your Android Simbans' tablet interface should feel familiar. With Android comes Google's store and everything in it can be downloaded and installed. The low price and its 'pure Android' makeup  contribute to most of the three stars because it's mostly downhill from here.- MicroSD storage expansion port. It's worth mentioning because most 'mainstream' 7" tablets do not have it.- Screen protector: it ships with a screen protector attached so if you see air bubbles on the front, don't be afraid or concerned, it's not a defect and feel free to remove it if you don't want it.And here is what anyone should be aware of (not so good qualities and features) before buying it.- Low specs: the sellers are quite honest so simply see them all listed at products's page. 4GB of onboard storage, low screen resolution, slow CPU all contribute to a low performance tablet but... remember, it's sells for half the price of last year's gorgeous Kindle Fire HD.- Non-standard charger: I expect to be able to charge a tablet through a Micro USB port so that I don't go into panic mode when the supplied non-standard charger stops working or is lost or left behind. I tend not to buy any gadget that doesn't support standard USB chargers because I simply don't need the trouble.- Narrow viewing angle: whether up/down or left/right you better be staying right in front of your little tablet, adjust it for optimal viewing and then don't move much because the moment you move... you'll have to readjust the tablet. To estimate the optimal viewing angle at 30-degrees before colors begin morphing may be a little too generous.- No Bluetooth: this is quite a disappointment because the built-in tiny speakers aren't sufficient. Yes, it's probably possible to plug 'something' through the headphones port but Bluetooth is the convenient way and it's not supported.There are a few more reasons to think twice before going with this tablet and they include some rather unimpressive battery life of maybe a couple of hours on a full charge, no GPS, a Chinese-only manual (seller stated in an email that buyers should get an English manual and I was given the Chinese version by mistake).The vendor believes that this tablet should be given to children because it doesn't cost too much. My personal view tends to be the opposite. Children tend to be less patient and more demanding  of their toys and gadgets than adults and I am afraid that they are not going to tolerate well a tablet that comes with a below average display, slow response to touch controls and is slow overall. But that is only my opinion. I am currently trying to set it up as an interface for a Harmony remote control and an Onkyo receiver which both come with their Android control apps. Not done yet but I will come back to this review and report once I have something to share.The three stars "It's Okay" are granted from the point of view of someone who makes an informed decision - see all of the above. Nobody should expect a top-of-the-line gadget at that price so, yes, it's slow and weak but it's also cheap.____________________________________________________NOTES:- My price-related comments were made when the tablet was on sale for $69. Obviously, prices can and do change and if the main reason for a positive review is 'price' then that goes away or diminishes when the prices goes up.- This is almost entirely my fault but I managed to fry the tablet. I was complaining about the non-standard charger above - I always prefer USB because they are so common and easy to share. Well... by mistake, I plugged my Samsung's Chromebook proprietary charger into the tablet's charging port and it happened to fit. It also destroyed the tablet. So... it's goodbye.

Decent for the price I bought this tablet on a Black Friday sale,so I was able to get a good deal.  Overall, I wish I had spent more money (even double) and gotten a better tablet.  My kids do not enjoy it because if it has been used at all, it will not have enough battery left to play a game, watch Netflix, etc.  Even on a fresh charge, I would say it goes for about 1 to 1.5 hours max.  Also, just annoying, but when it is plugged in there is no "assurance" light that lets you know that it is indeed charging.  When taking it on a road trip, we misplaced the charger.  It is an odd sized charger and no one carries it.  Radio Shack can put together two plugs to make it work...at a cost of thirty dollars.  I ordered an off brand plug that I hope fits it, but haven't received it.  Even that was twelve dollars.  If you can afford it all, get a better device.

A GREAT TABLET - VERY VERSATILE The tablet has been used for school and for watching Netflix and Hulu as well as Skype with the front camera. Speakers are good too. All in all, the tablet has done a great job. It's really nice to that you can expand it up to 32 GB.

Outstanding for the price (You get what you pay for after all) Details Below EDIT:There was a mix-up on specific models.  The review below applies to this specific model --> Proscan Internet Capacitive Included KeyboardDo not buy this one.  Buy the one linked to above.  It is only $10 more and it is much better.  I have heard that this model does not have access to the Google Play store, and struggles with even playing back a movie.*****  Review for slightly different model of same item, available here: Proscan Internet Capacitive Included Keyboard *****Firstly, let me state that the 5-star rating is comparing this table to OTHERS IN ITS CLASS.  This is not a Nexus, Asus, or Samsung tablet.  It is a bargain tablet in the low end range.I have tried several tablets that are below $100 and they were all virtually unusable, except for this one.  That being said, here are the pros and cons as I see it, including the things that make this tablet difficult for some:Pros:1.  The cheapest tablet available that is actually usable2.  If you get a bad one, Amazon will replace it.  Also most brick and mortar stores let you exchange/return as well3.  Runs Android 4+ so you have access to almost all the latest apps4.  Has the Google Play store among others.  Most cheap tablets lack the Google Play Store which cuts you off from the best apps5.  The included keyboard and case (if you're model comes with it) are really nice and work very well.  What a bargain!  I sometimes use the keyboard/case with my Nexus 76.  HDMI output is available so you can stream movies from the internet or an SD card (or home DLNA server) and watch them on your TV7.  The battery lasts for at least 4 hours of continuous use (haven't tested it too much).  It will go a couple days with light use8.  The expandable storage slots are nice9.  Has a capacitive touch screen so you don't have to push hard to get it to register the touch.Cons:1.  The wireless antenna sucks.  It doesn't have the range that the higher end tablets have.  This means that internet browsing will be a bit slower, and you can't be on the outskirts of the range.  It works consistently though as long as you're close enough to the wireless router.2.  The processor is slow, so it is far from snappy and responsive like a Nexus 7.  However, for less than half the price of the N7 you shouldn't expect it to be comparable.3.  USB charging is not available, so you have to use the included wall adapter.4.  If you want to play games with heavy graphics, the tablet will lag and stutter.  My kids play "My Play Home" and other graphical yet non-intensive games all the time without problem.5.  Even when close to a wireless source, the download speeds can be too slow for streaming video over the internet.  The best way to watch video is to put it on the SD card and play it with JoeVLC ([...]) or the built in player.Would definitely buy again, very happy with the tablet for the price.

 Length:: 4:05 MinsMy Simbans tablet is working quite well, and I've not yet had any of the less than positive experiences some of the other reviews have mentioned. I've had really bad tablets before, and this is not one of them. Please note that in my attached video, the lines on the screen are the effect of my camera trying to film a screen. They are not lines on the tablet's screen. The screen on the tablet is clear and colorful.Pros:- Touch screen works REALLY well. Very responsive.- Screen is bright and clear.- Sounds is adequate. Very clear, not muddy. But don't expect a lot of base.- Buttons are all easy to access and push. Volume rocker built in, so no need to rely only on the on-screen functions.- Charges really fast (however this is because of a smaller battery, so it also discharges fast)- Built in camera- Wifi works well- Apps work fine. I haven't run into any crashes yet. Small/simple game apps run okay. But don't try and play anything apps that require a super powerful processor. You'll get some lag. Angry Birds type app games are fine. But racing simulator games and such are probably too much for it.- It works! I'm amazed they can make a tablet that works this well for this price.Cons:- Screen is not glass and if you press too hard, you can damage it. Fortunately the tablet has such high touch screen sensitivity, I haven't need to press hard on it.- As mentioned before, it has small battery. So while it does charge up quickly, is also discharges quickly.Other notes:Keep in mind this is not a $300+ tablet, and doesn't have the same kinds of hardware inside. So browsing the internet and launching application is a bit slower. You have to wait a few seconds for each action.I did not run into the problem of the charger breaking. I've plugged mine in and out of the wall and tablet several times and it's still in one piece. It looks and feels just like any other power adapter and seems to work in the same way.The red color of this tablet has orange undertones to it. So if you have your heart set on an exact cherry red color, this isn't that. Personally I like the reddish-orange color even better.Conclusion:This tablet is good for someone who needs something very basic. You're not going to replace your computer with this. It's a good little device for reading emails, playing Angry Birds or doing crossword puzzles, using as an eReader or doing some browsing online. I wouldn't suggest it for some one looking for a tablet just to watch Netflix, because of the short battery life. You won't make it though a whole movie.Because of it's price point, it does make a good tablet for kids (who can play without damaging the screen), adults who need something for basic uses and even grandma and grandpa who just want something to read emails on and play some Sudoku. It's a good little device, just keep in mind the short battery life.Sample provided for review

Excellent Tablet / Subpar Keyboard I've had this tablet for a little over a week.  The Core i5 Processor is snappy, allowing you to run applications smoothly in both Windows 8 Desktop and Metro.  The Keyboard is subpar, not entirely recognizing all keystrokes however; the tablet shouldn't be faulted for a Keyboard.  If your looking for a keyboard, go purchase a high quality Bluetooth Keyboard to be used with this unit.There are a few minor issues I have had with the issue unit; however, I believe it may be more software related than hardware.-Some Applications may require you to use a Mouse if the Application is very dense; i.e. Design Applications, Financial Applications, etc.  I've had an issue with registering some touch inputs on very dense Applications.  i.e. Requires you to select an option which is very small on the screen.-Weight.  The unit weighs around 2lbs witout the case.  With the case, its a bit more.  The unit does way more than for example, the Ipad or most Android Tablets.  But keep in mind, this is a full Windows 8 Experience with a Core i5 Processor.  Even at 2lbs, the Unit is very light.The unit is constructed very well, with a glass front and metal back.-Audio.  The Audio has been amazing when using the Headphone Input.Overall, I would rate this Unit as 5 out of 5.  Ignoring the fallbacks with the keyboard as I simply consider the Keyboard to be icing on the cake rather than an actual function of the tablet.The unit also comes with a few adapters for VGA and HDMI and includes a Stand as well.

Acer Iconia W700-6499 11.6-Inch 128 GB Tablet (Silver) So far this tablet will do everything my desktop will do. Was heavier than expected. Would be perfect if it had a built-in card reader. Very nice and usable. Will never go back to a notebook.

EXCELLENT TABLET!!! Coby 8-inch GMS Android 4.0 8GB Internet Tablet 4:3 Capacitive Multi-Touch screen with Built-in Camera, Black (MID8065-8)I love this tablet - period.I purchased this tablet a few days ago for my son -- and kept it for myself!!! I started using it and couldn't put it down, so I just ordered him another one, which will arrive in a few days.-- MY COBY PASTI first bought a Coby tablet two years ago for my son's first birthday. It was a cheap 7 inch with Android 2 point-something-or-other that I got for about $80.00. I figured he'd toss it around a bit and quickly break it. I was very wrong. It actually ended up being a valuable learning tool -- even though the available applications were VERY limited due to the absence of Google certification. What truly amazed me was the build quality. He has essentially beaten the stuffing out of that poor thing and the screen, speakers, wireless radio, processor and everything else about it are still perfect! Furthermore, the battery still lasts for around 7 hours of continuous use on a full charge.-- MY COBY PRESENTMy wife uses a Samsung Galaxy Tab with Ice Cream Sandwich that she paid an arm and a leg for. Watching her use it quite effectively for various things, I got envious and decided I needed to grab a tablet for myself and see if I could dispense with carrying my laptop everywhere. I also figured that my son needed something with Google certification because there's a lot of stuff he was doing on my wife's tablet because she has access to Google Play on her tablet, but his old one doesn't. So, with those two points of reference, my son's old Coby and my wife's Samsung, I started my research to see what I could find for my mini-me, and me.I settled on and bought one Coby Kyros 8065 -- and then a second one.The Samsung is impressive, but lacks ports and is way too expensive. The Coby, now with full Google certs and Ice Cream Sandwich -- is just as impressive, has a ton of ports (hdmi, usb, etc), and it's remarkably cheaper. Beyond that, my son has proven to me that Coby builds amazingly durable tablets! I don't intend to toss this one around like he did with the old 7-inch. But, I know that if I drop it a few times it will be fine.Comparatively, my Coby works just as well as my wife's Samsung. It's just as fast, just as bright, etc. But, it can do far more in terms of the ports (and it was way cheaper). Every time I pick this Kyros up and use it I smile. It is VERY rare these days that I actually feel like I bought something without being taken advantage of in some way. But, with this, I know I got my money's worth. This is a purchase that I feel really good about.I haven't really been a Coby product fan since I bought one of their cheap fake-me-out walkmans in high school -- which broke the next day. But, I'll be a Coby Kyros buyer for years to come. They got it RIGHT with the tablets.

Slow and weak but affordable You can get the Simbans little honest-to-goodness 7" Android tablet for about the price of a PS3 or Xbox video game but... is it worth that much when a vastly superior, last year's vintage Kindle Fire HD (yes, not 'pure' Android) or a Nexus 7 could be had for the price of 2-3 video games? The makers of Simbans believe it is so and, to prove it, they provided me with a 'for review' unit so that I can see it for myself and write about it. I am not fully convinced.To start with the 'goods', yes, this Android 4.2 tablet does handle games and the various Google apps without crashing. I was able to play Temple Run, for example and I was able to survive for the first few hundred meters even though the frame rate was not the smoothest. Netflix... barely, It showed me the first 5 minutes or so of a movie, then went into 'buffering' mode and stayed there until the battery ran out. The camera does take pictures and it even supports Android's 360-degree camera mode but the resolution is low and the response to touch could be better.But I'm getting a little ahead of myself because I'm talking about the good features right now so, before I lose focus, let me make a case of why anyone would want to consider purchasing this product.- Inexpensive: I may be wrong but I don't believe that you can get a tablet (not a joke) that actually works for this little money.- Pure Android: unlike the Kindle Fire so, if you know and love your Android Simbans' tablet interface should feel familiar. With Android comes Google's store and everything in it can be downloaded and installed. The low price and its 'pure Android' makeup  contribute to most of the three stars because it's mostly downhill from here.- MicroSD storage expansion port. It's worth mentioning because most 'mainstream' 7" tablets do not have it.- Screen protector: it ships with a screen protector attached so if you see air bubbles on the front, don't be afraid or concerned, it's not a defect and feel free to remove it if you don't want it.And here is what anyone should be aware of (not so good qualities and features) before buying it.- Low specs: the sellers are quite honest so simply see them all listed at products's page. 4GB of onboard storage, low screen resolution, slow CPU all contribute to a low performance tablet but... remember, it's sells for half the price of last year's gorgeous Kindle Fire HD.- Non-standard charger: I expect to be able to charge a tablet through a Micro USB port so that I don't go into panic mode when the supplied non-standard charger stops working or is lost or left behind. I tend not to buy any gadget that doesn't support standard USB chargers because I simply don't need the trouble.- Narrow viewing angle: whether up/down or left/right you better be staying right in front of your little tablet, adjust it for optimal viewing and then don't move much because the moment you move... you'll have to readjust the tablet. To estimate the optimal viewing angle at 30-degrees before colors begin morphing may be a little too generous.- No Bluetooth: this is quite a disappointment because the built-in tiny speakers aren't sufficient. Yes, it's probably possible to plug 'something' through the headphones port but Bluetooth is the convenient way and it's not supported.There are a few more reasons to think twice before going with this tablet and they include some rather unimpressive battery life of maybe a couple of hours on a full charge, no GPS, a Chinese-only manual (seller stated in an email that buyers should get an English manual and I was given the Chinese version by mistake).The vendor believes that this tablet should be given to children because it doesn't cost too much. My personal view tends to be the opposite. Children tend to be less patient and more demanding  of their toys and gadgets than adults and I am afraid that they are not going to tolerate well a tablet that comes with a below average display, slow response to touch controls and is slow overall. But that is only my opinion. I am currently trying to set it up as an interface for a Harmony remote control and an Onkyo receiver which both come with their Android control apps. Not done yet but I will come back to this review and report once I have something to share.The three stars "It's Okay" are granted from the point of view of someone who makes an informed decision - see all of the above. Nobody should expect a top-of-the-line gadget at that price so, yes, it's slow and weak but it's also cheap.____________________________________________________NOTES:- My price-related comments were made when the tablet was on sale for $69. Obviously, prices can and do change and if the main reason for a positive review is 'price' then that goes away or diminishes when the prices goes up.- This is almost entirely my fault but I managed to fry the tablet. I was complaining about the non-standard charger above - I always prefer USB because they are so common and easy to share. Well... by mistake, I plugged my Samsung's Chromebook proprietary charger into the tablet's charging port and it happened to fit. It also destroyed the tablet. So... it's goodbye.

Great Multipurpose Tablet This product is amazing. It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day! It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have. I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system). I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version. I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version. I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010). However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once. I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not "obsolete."Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day. I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of "to do" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant "plus" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will. If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device. In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc. I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting. Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.

It's a good tablet for the price My first tablet stopped working after a couple of weeks of use. I think my son downloaded too many games on it and probably fried the processor or something. Who knows.Update 09/26/2013:  The seller did not do anything for me. They never responded to me. I contacted Amazon and they referred me to Matricom's headquarters. Matricom customer service was helpful and they asked me to mail the tablet back to them. It did cost me $5.60 out of pocket to send in the tablet, but they replaced it with a brand new tablet. The new tablet has been working fine for now for a few weeks. I just monitor it more closely and I keep my son from downloading too many games from the playstore. This tablet only has 512mb of RAM so it does run slow. I increased my rating to 4 stars due to good customer service, and that it's not THAT bad of a tablet considering the price.BOTTOM LINE: This is NOT an IPAD replacement. This is NOT a SURFACE or a GALAXY TAB replacement. This is not even a KINDLE FIRE replacement. Please people, come on now! If you pay $65 for a tablet, expect it to work as such. In a world where a good pair of headphones costs $300 and a decent smartphone costs nearly $600, if you pay $65 for a tablet, you will not get a super fast super responsive tablet. It's good for kids, to play basic games, and watch some cartoons and stuff. The battery life is only about a couple of hours. It could be a little better. I would have been super happy with 3-4 hours of battery life, but oh well. I spent $65 and my 4 year old thinks he's got the best thing in the world, so I can't complain.

Poor WiFi performance,  the Asus Memo Pad fhd 10 inch tablet is much better. Problem with my used tablet I bought was that it had extremely bad WIFI performance.  My mobile hotspot wifi connection would not work more  than 3 ft away from the tablet.  The reseller probably didn't check the wifi before selling it to me.

Surprisingly decent budget tablet I got one of these for a friend, someone who I know isn't going to be picky about hardware specs and speed. There are a lot of entry-level Android tablets out there now, some of which are sub-$100 models. You can actually get this one in that price range if you find it on sale, but what sets it apart from a lot of others is it's actually not half bad.On that note, a word of warning- most if not all other tablets in this price range are little more than child's toys. They tend to have very weak hardware that can barely handle Angry Birds and will lag seriously if you try to stream video. Furthermore the build quality is shoddy- they use cheap plastic and glass that affords poor viewing angle, has bad glare in bright light, and is very easy to scratch or break.The main reason I even gave this consideration is it's made by Asus. I've used Asus hardware for a very long time- everything ranging from motherboards to graphics cards, monitors, laptops, routers, and most recently the Nexus 7. Generally speaking, their hardware is very solid in terms of performance and reliability. In fact I can't think of a single time I've been disappointed by one of their products. I figured even if this tablet was suspiciously cheap, it was probably at least decent. And it is.First, expectations. This is not an iPad and you aren't paying $500+ for it. If you expect it to perform like an iPad, you WILL be disappointed. It's also half the price of the similar-sized Nexus 7 and of course not as nice. But for what you pay for, it's surprisingly good. Particularly, it has these pro points:-- A lot of internal storage (16 GB), twice the Nexus 7 base model and as much as the Kindle Fire HD base model.-- It is an Android 4.1 Jellybean tablet. Most tablets in this price range are 2.3 or 4.0-- It has a micro-SD slot, which is very noteworthy. Many significantly more expensive tablets, including the Nexus 7, do not have one (the cheapest decent one I know of is the Galaxy Tab 2 7, which is about $70 more).-- Pretty decent hardware and chipset- it's comparable to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7. I at first thought the VIA chipset would be considerably slower, but it's actually so similar as makes no difference. It's robust enough to run some pretty heavyweight apps, and can stream HD flawlessly.-- Light weight, solid build. The tablet has a rubberized back that feels rugged and affords good grip. It is about the same size and weight as the Nexus 7.-- Good battery life. It lasts about as long as its more expensive cousins, especially if you don't use 'performance mode.'-- Comes with an AC adapter. Might not seem a plus, but these days a lot of electronics don't include one, which can be a pain.I suspect a lot of the complaints I've seen about apps and performance have to do with teething bugs. When a new device is released, this is pretty normal- a few updates usually fixes it. I've seen little in the way of these problems so far. That said, there are of course some downsides to this tablet:-- The display is average at best. Touch controls work fine, resolution is not bad, but the viewing angle is very noticeably more narrow than a lot of higher priced tablets (not terribad though, like the Dell Streak 7). It also seems to suffer more from glare, possibly because the backlight doesn't seem to be that powerful even on full brightness. It's by no means unworkable but if you're not looking straight at the screen or if you're viewing it in bright light, it's harder to make out detail.-- As with the Nexus 7, the speaker (note singular) on this tablet is pretty mediocre. You'll want headphones if you listen to music or stream videos. It works fine for things like Skype though.-- Ditto with the camera, which is essentially just a webcam. Unlike the pretty decent cameras on the Galaxy Tab 2, you're definitely not going to be using this to take pictures.-- No bluetooth. This is probably the biggest minus as far as feature set goes, and though the virtual keyboard is well done, it's still not great for things like email. This also means there's no wireless file transfer, though the SD slot and cloud storage mitigates that.-- Some apps are apparently still incompatible at this writing, notably Instagram 4.0 (however, I was able to sideload 3.5). I don't expect this to remain an issue for long.Overall, I would say this is a solid tablet considering what you're paying for it. I will also note though that you can 'fix' pretty much all of those cons by paying $60-70 more for a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Still, for a device that you can get for as low as $80 on sale, this is a surprisingly good performer. It's practical, inexpensive enough to gift, and doesn't cost so much that you'll be scared to use it.Edit: 8/9/2013- just to add a few extra points in the MeMO Pad's favor:-- This thing actually supports USB on the go. I was frankly amazed by this since a lot of much more expensive tablets and phones do not (including the KFHD). I've tried flash drives and a voice recorder; both work perfectly (you'll probably need a 3rd party cable for this).-- The battery life on standby is pretty good. I've let it sit for 2 weeks with minimal use (wifi and sync on) and it still has about 1/4 charge. Not bad.I've noticed that the 1st gen Nexus 7 has received a massive price drop (probably due to the release of the 2nd gen) that makes it much more competitive. The MeMO pad is definitely still the choice if you're on a budget though.

Heavy Horsepower for the Tablet World UPDATE:  Microsoft has just announced the Surface Pro 2.  If you're considering a Surface Pro, you might consider weighing the cost of the Pro 2 against the inevitable price drop we'll see here for the Surface Pro.First, let's clear up some confusion about the Microsoft Surface Tablet:  people often ask me, "Why is this one so much more expensive than that one?"The first Surface tablet to be released was the Surface RT.  It runs a stripped-down version of Windows 8 that can only run a smaller set of applications:  programs written specifically for the Surface RT.  Part of this is due to the hardware inside the Surface RT, and that's why you can't just upgrade a cheaper RT tablet to be a full Windows 8 device.  This device is the Microsoft Surface Pro.  It runs the full-blown Windows 8 Professional operating system and can for all intents and purposes do just about anything a low to mid-range desktop or laptop can do...and then some.I say "Then some" because the extra dimension here is touch.  The Surface is all about using the touchscreen to interact with it.  There is also a stylus, and that tends to be a must-have when you start trying to interact with smaller objects, but Windows 8 was designed to be physically handled.  Gestures can close programs, bring up a touchscreen keyboard, flip through options, and more.  The only downside to the hardware is it's slightly unfriendly to left-handers:  the stylus pen docks on the right and the stylus socket doubles as the power-plug, meaning that when it's plugged in, you're more likely to need to put it on the right side of a desk or get an extension cord.  Other than that, we have an amazing piece of machinery that is fast, responsive, and simply fun to play with.  The Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of RAM are put to good use--it has a Windows Experience Index of 6.9, if you're curious--and the dual cameras front and back imply lots of picture-taking and video fun.  There is also a DisplayPort adapter that will easily connect to a monitor or flat-panel TV (cables sold separately).  The case of the Surface is smooth:  the "VaporMg" magnesium body feels like titanium and the weight of the hardware imparts a sense of toughness to it.  The glossy 1920x1080 screen is bright and colorful, and it was a very clever design touch to make the lower half of the back be the kickstand to hold the Surface steady.  If you buy the keyboard--and I can't imagine dealing without it--it snaps smartly onto the 'bottom' edge of the Surface and acts as a screen cover when you fold it up.  The Surface Pro is also smart enough that when you fold it back to hold the unit as a tablet, the keyboard does not respond to touch--no accidental keystrokes from the back of your arm.  When evaluating the snap-on keyboard, the hard keyboard feels most like a real keyboard and the soft one takes some getting used to.So then we come to the cons.  Thankfully, they are few.  For one, you'll probably end up adjusting the Windows UI a bit, as there may be times the font of Office or other system menus is just too tiny, or the buttons require you to tap into a pretty small space.  It takes a bit of getting used to, developing the feel for switching from fingertip to pen-tip.  Then there is an awkward issue with the stylus in that it is *supposed* to work in a pressure-sensitive way with Photoshop, but thus far only some people are able to get the right drivers to get it to work--so if you're thinking about buying a Surface Pro for digital art you might want to look into whether this is fixed (and I'll update here when mine works).  The battery life is nice because the hardware was designed for it, but that also means you want to keep your Power Options on 'Balanced' or Power Saver'--'High Performance' will suck down the battery much faster if you're interacting with the Surface for a while...this doesn't really impact the responsiveness of the 'Surface', it's just something a power user might want to keep in mind:  you're not going to want to push this thing to the top end of performance the whole time it's on.And then there's probably the biggest drawback:  the price.  At a thousand dollars or more (once you add keyboard/cables/accessories), knowing you could buy a pretty good desktop or laptop for this money, you're really buying the Surface for convenience.  It is one of (if not 'the') most powerful Windows tablets on the market today, and it is in every sense of the word a tablet-shaped computer in its power and its capabilities.  It runs all sorts of everyday computing extremely well, so you are getting a lot of bang for a lot of buck.  I am enjoying my Surface Pro very much, but I'm not sure I'm at the point where this would fully replace a desktop or laptop for everything I do.  If I wanted the most powerful and flexible tablet I could think of though, I couldn't ask for better.

My 9" D2 Pad I bought this tablet after seeing it being introduced on the NBC network. I ordered it the same day I saw it advertised. I wished I had gone online and read the reviews first. I was very disappointed with the camera which is one thing that is important to me on any tablet. The pictures are horrible so I dont use the camera. Everything else works fine.  I havent had any problems so far and I have had it for about 5 months and I use it everyday.  My grandkids love it for the games. I have downloaded alot of stuff from playstore no problem. I bought a memory card. It doesnt take long to use up the battery but thats ok I got the charger. I wont be purchasing another one of these for myself but I would get it for the little ones. I'm looking at the galaxy now. I wouldnt recommend the D2 if you gonna use it for more than just email and games. I need a tablet to be my everything.  But the D2 tablet still is not bad for the price I paid. The only reason I didnt give it a 4 was because of the camera. I would recommend it for someone that doesnt do a lot with a tablet.

Great Tablet, Great Value!! I bought 2 of these D2 7" tablets during the holiday season for $79.99 each. I purchased a blue one for myself and a pink one for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I must say that I'm very impressed with our overall experience with these products.My daughter absolutely loves her pink tablet and uses it all the time. She is constantly watching videos on youtube and playing on Disney websites but even more so she loves all the games, books and apps that are geared toward kids that come pre-loaded on these tablets. The fact that D2 pre-loads 20 eBooks for kids, lots of kids learning apps from Kevin Bradford, and other fun games and apps makes these tablets an even bigger hit in our household.From a parent standpoint this tablet also works very well and comes equiped with pre-loaded utilities such as Dropbox, Pulse News and Kingsoft Office. However since these tablets seem to be marketed as a household tablet that can work for the enitre family I was also impressed that D2 had thought to pre-load a Kids Place parental control app launcher to protect personal data and restrict kids to only approved apps.From my experience we have had no issues with our D2 tablets and the internet seems to work just fine on my home wifi network. I would definately recommend this tablet and believe it is a great value at $79.99.

Good if you use Opera Mini browser I just bought this Ematic tablet today.  Chrome is too slow.  "Opera Mini" is the fastest browser for this tablet because it condenses websites before downloading them.  You can get Opera Mini from "Play Store".  As long as you use Opera Mini, this tablet is worth the price.

Easy to Carry and Runs Great! I had recently purchased the Ematic Mini Tab for my children and it worked great. So I decided to try out the Ematic Multi-Touch Tablet. As an architect for a construction company, I felt like I needed a tablet to keep in touch with my clients. I was certainly glad that I chose the Emactic Multi-Touch Tablet. I haven't had any trouble with it in the past 3 months that I have owned it. The internet runs well and the storage is pretty large. When I travel, the tablet is easy to carry and I don't have to worry about losing it. I have dropped it a couple of times while working and there was not damage on it. If you need a tablet, the Ematic Multi-Touch Tablet is the way to go!

Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1" x 6.2" x 0.31" vs. 9.4" x 6.4" x 0.35"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special "reading mode" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The "Recommended for you" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule "Quiet Time" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download "Casablanca" but not able to download "The Avengers" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7", and the Nexus is 10". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy."It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1" x 6.2" x 0.31" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4" x 6.6" x 0.29" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.

No Epub Support Had this, sent it back.  I found out too late it does not support Epub books.  Since I have over 2000 books in this format this device became essentially useless to me.  I wish I had done my homework first and found this out.  And SHAME ON AMAZON for not supporting the industry standard for electronic publishing.  I will not even consider a Kindle until that happens.

Razer Edge Pro 256GB Tablet First of all I would like to say Amazon you guy's rock!!!  Thank You  and I will explain why in a bit ok so I ordered one of these Razer Edge Pro gaming tablets I've been following this since it was called project fiona after watching tons of YouTube unboxing videos to see how the tablet looked. I gotta admit it was pretty expensive when first released after amazon dropped the price I ordered one and when I received it it was working but it had a defect  with charging the internal battery anyway amazon with there amazing super 5 star *****  customer service quickly send me a replacement unit and I returned the defective unit back to them. Now for the gaming tablet this device is awesome I installed Thief 2014 since I am a thief fan of all the other thief games anyway I ran the game I couldn't believe I was playing a pc game on the go and on the bus I also have the gamepad and extended battery and docking station I was on my way to upstate albany it ran the game and the performance was excellent on medium settings and I played for about 2 hrs before I had to plug it in and charge it up and I've also installed other pc games on it like trine and Ghostbusters the video game  I gotta say I love this device amazing tablet it's true what other people said about the razer edge accessories it is becoming harder to find and more expensive has the tablet is no longer being sold anymore by Razer they did have very high demands on  pre orders which were sold out.Pros: of the deviceVery fast ssd hard drive.Excellent volume on both speakers very loud better then most laptop speakers.Screen is very vivid on games nice ips screen.Battery last long for regular tablet use.Touch screen works the way it should.Cons: of the deviceit's a little thick on the tablet side and may be a little heavy compared to an ipad for regular tablet use.but that is to be expected due to the power this tablet has. No other tablet comes even close to this power horse.no sd card slot.no ethernet portno hdmi port or vga port.have to use the docking station to get hdmi output.does not come with a tablet stand have to use docking station to stand the tablet up but you can use a universal tablet stand it will do the job just fine.does get a little heavy with the extra accessories with the gamepad along with external battery. doesn't really bother me at all anymore I've gotten use to it now.Overall this tablet rocks I am blown away that I can carry this with me rather then trying to carry a very heavy laptop with all the accessories and I can play my games on the subway going to my job or on the bus Razer really did an excellent job with the gaming tablet it's a shame they no longer sell it. I really believe other gamers would enjoy it. RAZER if your reading my review I can't wait to see the next gaming tablet you guy's make once again I definitely recommend this gaming tablet to any gamer since I am a gamer myself. I know what most people will say this tablet is very expensive I can buy a nice gaming laptop for cheap that maybe the case but the purpose of the gaming tablet is for someone who already has a nice laptop but also want a unique device that can play pc games where ever they go I find this tablet easier to setup vs using a laptop. For anyone out there that would like to get the gaming tablet if you can get one I recommend not letting it slip by you it is definitely worth it I am very happy with my gaming tablet. To:  Amazon Thank You again for the amazing customer service  :)

Amazon is a little tricky This would have been an excellent product, if Amazon hadn't sent me a "refurbished" tablet. I ordered a "new" so imagine my surprise when I start setting it up and then another persons name, personal contacts, etc. pop up. Now my account will forever be melded with this other person. Managed to delete most of the other person's info, but I shouldn't have had to go through all of that in the first place. Amazon did offer to exchange this one for a "new" one, but seeing as how my account is already melded with this other person, there is not much that can be done to fix it now. However, it has run fantastically otherwise! Above and beyond expectations. :)

Poor Product I purchase this tablet for my niece so when I first got this tablet I was excited to see what it can do. But after one day of try outs I found the product to be very lacking in many respects. Firstly, the battery is a horror story and I am not exaggerating because I am pissed; the battery is really really poor. It lasts approximately 40 mins of intense use, wats up with that. Secondly, the audio is barely above a whisper. I have to now go and buy speakers if I want my niece to hear music and watch videos; an extra cost i can do without. Thirdly the camera, at night the camera cannot take any pictures unless you are capturing the dark you cannot see a single image even when your house light is on. I am laughing right now jus typing about the camera ( even a me too phone has a better camera). And finally the wireless, the best connectivity is when you are close to the router any distance and the connection is poor.The picture quality is not bad and u can download the important apps u want. Dats about for the good. To be brutally honest I will not recommend this product for any parent buying this for their kids, cousins, nieces and nephews or anybody for dat matter.last but not least, it took them sometime to shipped this product.Update 03/06/13The charger of this product no longer works. One month and I cannot use the tablet because the charger is not working. Highly disappointed.

A (pretty) great value I'm very pleased with the quality and performance of this product, but it has taken some time to get used to the the tablet "form factor" and the quirks of the Android operating system. This review will touch on those issues as well as my impressions of the Asus MeMo Pad Smart 10 itself.Screen Resolution. For some reason most tablet reviews start with the screen resolution. The Asus Memo 10 has 1280 x 800 pixels versus the Nexus 10's 2560 x 1600 and the iPad4's 2048 x 1536.  Perhaps the greater resolution on the Nexus and iPad4 does have some benefits, but I don't know what they might be. Text and colors are very clear and bright on the Asus. By having four times as many pixels, the Nexus is locked into needing more processing power just to update screen content. To what end? There may be real benefits, but I don't see them -- and that's the point! The screen resolution for both text and images is very, very good.Processing power. With a quad-core Tegra3 processor, this is a speedy tablet. Judging by how it runs the 3D graphics of NVDIA Glowball, it shouldn't have any problems with advanced games. It certainly has no problems in ordinary use when browsing, reading ebooks, handling multiple applications at once, and so on.Speakers. One of the best features of this tablet is the quality of the speakers. Sound quality is reasonably good for such tiny speakers and the volume is impressive. When the volume is all the way up, the tablet can fill a fairly large room with music. I no longer need to plug in an external speaker in order to watch a movie with my wife.(Update 4/17/2013. After using the speakers at full volume for about a week, they have developed an annoying rattle or buzz. I must now plug in an external speaker for music or use headphones. The initial volume was too good to remain true!)Software. One of the real strengths of this tablet is the vast assortment of apps -- many of them free. The Asus Memo 10 comes preloaded with a set of basic of apps to help those (like me) who are new to the Android OS. Using Google's Play Store one can effortlessly download and install any number of other apps. Since I use Kindles for most of my reading, it was nice to find the Amazon Kindle app preinstalled. The Amazon Appstore for Android is not preinstalled but can be downloaded from Amazon's website and gives access to Amazon's free app of the day. One disadvantage of Android software is that there is rarely an adequate help file. This makes it a real challenge to figure out how to take full advantage of the various aspects of the programs.My biggest initial challenge was to find a decent application for writing. Google Drive seemed ideal except that I couldn't find a way to get it to spell check complete documents -- (It does spell check "on the fly")--so my first  solution was to use a little app called Writer. It has a decent spell check implementation, but documents are limited in length and it cannot directly edit documents on Google Drive. I had to open my document in Google Drive, 'long-press' anywhere in the document to allow selecting all of the text, and create a new Writer document in which to paste that text. After editing, I reversed the process to paste the edited text back into my Google Drive document. At least this somewhat inconvenient system allowed cross-platform access to my documents. But the tablet keyboard was a bit too responsive so that extra characters or wrong keys were common. After some research I installed SwiftKey tablet keyboard and made it my default. I'm impressed. It is a very handy keyboard. Typing is far more accurate than on the other keyboards I have tried so far.  Capitalization and apostrophes are handled automatically. Word prediction is pretty good. It costs money, but it could be worth it. The keyboard works as it should both in Google Drive and in the browser's Gmail or the Android Gmail app. Problem solved. (Update 5/9/2013 Android 4.2 includes a much-improved keyboard with "on the fly" spell check and the ability to type using swipe gestures. To upgrade the table to Android 4.2.1 go to Settings > About Tablet > System Update.) Kingsoft Office is the best Android word processing application that I have discovered so far. You can use it to directly edit documents on Google drive and it includes an adequate spell check feature.Streaming video. One of my main reasons for buying a tablet was to improve streaming video from YouTube and Amazon Prime. YouTube worked perfectly from the start, limited only by the speed of the wifi connection. To get Amazon prime video to stream, it was necessary to side-load Flash and use the native android browser. But it does work--and very well indeed. (Update. It Did work! Amazon seems to have done something to bollix up flash support in android browsers. I am not happy about that! I will update this review again if I can discover at way to solve this problem. Update2. Puffin browser shows Amazon Prime videos but there is a bit of lag. Better than nothing. Update 3. As of May 23, you can once again stream Amazon Prime Video without lag using the native android browser, Chrome, Firefox or Dolphin as long as you have side-loaded Flash! )Slideshow. A ten-inch tablet is,  of course,  a media consumption device and to some extent a productivity  tool,  but when not in use, it also makes a very handy digital photo frame. All one needs to do is load up some photos, which is very easy to do because of the micro sd card slot. One great feature of this tablet is that you can easily set it up to show a slideshow of your favorite photos on the desktop background as well as on the sleep screen. To do so, pull down the menu with the blue icons at the top right corner. Tap Settings>Display>Home-and-Lock-Screen>Live Wallpapers>Asus MyFrame, and then choose a folder containing the photos you wish to display.Sd card slot. This is a vital feature. The Google Nexus 10 lacks one. The iPad4 lacks one.  Yet without an sd card slot, it is much more difficult to transfer songs, photos, and documents to and from the device. If you have permanent access to a high speed data connection, fine. If not and if you wish to store your songs and videos right on the device itself, you will want an sd card slot. Besides, a 16 gig tablet is somewhat short of internal space. It is handy to be able to expand the storage as needed.The tiny and perhaps delicate mini-usb connection is potentially a serious flaw because this eminently breakable connector is the sole way of recharging the tablet. With a newly purchased machine, be very careful when plugging in the mini-usb connector. With time and a bit of practice, I have gotten the feel of this, but I am still careful.Thoughts on the 10-inch tablet form factor:A ten-inch tablet is a bit too large to grip firmly with one hand, and this one is even a little slippery. I have large hands and can hold it one-handed in portrait mode, but generally I need to use two hands--and exercise caution even then.Learn to love your microfiber cloth. Tablets are renowned for picking up fingerprints and this one is no exception. Keep a microfiber cloth with you at all times.In landscape mode this tablet has a large, comfortable keyboard--especially with the SwiftKey tablet keyboard mentioned earlier. Touch typing is perhaps possible. The upgraded keyboard in Android 4.2.1 is superb! It has a great swipe capability and on-the-fly spell checking.All in all I think I may prefer the form factor of a Chrome netbook or an ultra book, but in most respects this is a fine tablet.UPDATE 6/15/2013. I have recently upgraded my experience with this tablet by making three inexpensive purchases. First I bought a Moko Slim Cover Case [[ASIN:B00BP5NIKI MoKo Slim Cover Case for ASUS MeMo Pad Smart ME301 / ME301T 10.1 inch Android 4.1 Jelly Bean tablet, BLACK (with Flip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)]. This nicely protects the screen and provides a fairly stable viewing stand. Next I bought an inexpensive set of styluses, which minimize fingerprints on the screen and make navigation much easier. Finally, I bought an inexpensive micro USB to USB OTG (on the go) adaptor. This gives the tablet a full-sized USB port for plugging in various accessories such as a USB memory stick or (more importantly) a wireless keyboard and mouse. I'm currently using an old Logitech keyboard that I had lying around and it works great! It turns the little tablet into a solid substitute for a laptop or netbook. It does, however, drain the tablet's battery more rapidly, but that's something I can live with when I need to do serious work processing.

Five reasons why you should save your money and not buy from nabi Based on my experience with nabi tablets (I've used all four nabis), I have came to the conclusion that while at first nabi is tempting to buy, in the long term, it is a bad buy.1. Product quality: I remember when nabi 1 came out and there was a huge issue with the charger, you'd think nabi learned from that incident and improved their charger's quality. nabi 2 came out and the charger issue came back. nabi had to built an entire site dedicated to replacing chargers. If you've ever taken apart a nabi and see the components inside, it is a frightful sight. Parts are held together with masking tapes.2. Customer service: Most of nabi's customer service is done through Facebook. You leave a comment on Facebook and someone from nabi will reply. I don't know who at nabi thought this is a good idea because most of the time your questions get lost in the sea of questions, complaints, and comments. Most customers complain about nabi support's response time which can take weeks or even months.3. Contents: Most of the preloaded applications on nabi can be downloaded for free from Google Play or AppStore depending on if you use Android or iOS. If you take a closer look at nabi's app list, most of them are demos you can get for free or copy-cat apps you can download from Google Play or AppStore. Why risk your money with an unknown brand just because they helped you pre-downloaded some apps?4. App Store: No Google Play. In order to get more apps on the device, you'll need to download the Amazon App Store which has a very limited selection of apps compare to the Google Play store. nabi does have their own app store called AppZone but the quantity and quality of the apps in AppZone leave much to be desired.5. There are better choices: Spend a few bucks on bumper and buy from a tablet reputable company like Google, Apple, Amazon, or Samsung. What you get is better product quality, customer service, content, and most importantly, peace of mind.

Only worked for about a week - you get what you pay for. This tablet worked for about a week. Then something broke within the charger and it can no longer be charged, therefore no longer be used. You get what you pay for - my 11 year old son wasted his own money on this. Now we are going to get him a Samsung Galaxy tab for Christmas. I do not recommend buying this tablet.

Perfect for people who want both a tablet and a phone but don't want to lug both around I just received the Galaxy Note 8.0 N5100 yesterday, and so far I can't say anything but good things about it.As other reviewers have pointed out, this is the international version with 3G. In other words, this is a cell phone, a very large one, yes, but a cell phone nonetheless.My understanding is that the AT&T; network (and others like Red Pocket that use the same network) is the appropriate one for this phone in the U.S. I had a T-mobile micro sim card at home so I decided to give that a try and activated prepaid service on the device. It works just fine, I have made and received calls, no problem. Data works on it as well, though I do not know at what speeds. I find myself mostly in places with WiFi so I normally do not worry too much about network data speeds, but again, my understanding from what I have read is that this device will work faster on the AT&T; network because of the radio bands.I am 6'1'' with average-sized hands for a person my size. I am able to hold the phone in one hand with no problem. In case you are wondering, yes, I have put the phone to my ear and used it as a regular phone. It works just like any cell phone because, well, it is a cell phone. This device is essentially a Galaxy Note phone but larger than the ones available here in the U.S.As far as technical aspects, there are probably reviews out there by people much more knowledgeable than I am, so you should probably look at some of those reviews available online. I can tell you this is the best phone and also the best tablet I have ever owned. It is powerful, fast, and comes with all sorts of bells and whistles in terms of what you can do with the S pen. Also, I really like that the micro sim card and the micro sd card can be inserted without having to remove back covers or anything like that, which is something I have disliked in most cell phones in recent years. The slots for the micro sim card and the memory card are on the side and easy to open.I consider this to be the best cell phone out there. While size and portability may be an issue for some (and since I have been using the biggest phones I could find in recent years I do get a lot of comments from people about what a hassle it must be to lug something this big around), given that I find most smart phone screens too small for doing anything productive and I find large tablets too uncomfortable to carry around, I think that the Note 8 3G is the perfect middle ground. I would consider anything between a 7 and 8 inch screen as being in the sweet spot for portability and usefulness. Having said that, I would not want to carry an 8 inch tablet around if on top of that I was also carrying a smart phone. So again, this is why I think of this as the perfect smart phone. The phone does fit in my back pockets, though I am sure that it might not feed in a lot of pockets. I suspect most people would actually have a difficult time finding pockets that are wide enough for it to fit, so if you are thinking about getting this phone you may want to think about alternative ways of carrying it. Otherwise, you could do what I did: before buying it, look up the exact specifications of the phone, cut out a piece of cardboard in the size and shape of the phone, and try to fit it in the pockets of the pants you wear frequently.

WARNING: BAD PRODUCT I bought 5 of these for my children for Christmas 2012. Every one of them broke within a week. The charging ports are bad on them. I sent them back to the company who repaired them, but it took 4 months to get them back. They broke again. I was able to get my money back from Wal-mart for 2 of them which was nice because I purchased a warranty for those. However, I sent my daughter's back to the maker in February 2013 and didn't get it back until July!!! Then it broke again within a week-the charging port again, and they refused to fix it. Another problem with it is if your child is old enough to figure out a birth date year that makes him older than 10 years old, the parental controls will not work. Then they have free access to explicit internet material. My kids are definitely smart enough to figure that one out so this is not a kid safe device.Another huge frustration is the touch screen doesn't work well. There have been times I haven't been able to return to the settings because it was at the bottom of the screen where it wouldn't allow me to touch. HUGE, HUGE, HUGE FRUSTRATION!! I just about wanted to flush the thing. I have also had these to just not boot. It just sits there on the loading screen for days. I sent that one back for this problem, too, which was another 4 month wait for a repaired one. I will never buy an Ematic product again!! My recommendation is to buy an old working ipod touch (whatever generation you budget can buy) on ebay, download free apps and set parental controls. It is MUCH better, safer and cheaper! This is what we did and I wish I would have done this for Christmas last year!! Lesson learned.

Nice tablet! After doing some extensive research on a tablet to fit my budget it came down to the Dell Venue 7 and the Ematic Pro EGP008BL.I settled on the Ematic primarily because of the HDMI port. Nearly all the sites I researched including the site I bought the Ematic Pro from stated the tablet did not have Bluetooth and I was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived to discover it does indeed have Bluetooth and it works great as does the Wi-Fi which gets a 90 to 100% signal. Has Ethernet capability also. Battery life is close to 6 hours when surfing the web viewing email and such. The Ematic Pro 8 also doesn't overdo it with preloaded apps and though I haven't tried it yet I believe they can be uninstalled. The tablet is fast with great picture quality and good screen touch response. The only con is the sound which is poor but I would still highly recommend this tablet.

Works good for the price I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for music, games and some quick browsing & email. Works really good for the price. I've used other inexpensive tablets and this one is better than most. It comes with Google play which is a big plus. Of course its a bit slow and doesn't have a lot of storage, but for $60 it does everything a friend's $200 tablet does just a bit slower. I would recommend this for someone that is looking for an inexpensive tablet and doesn't mind it being a bit sluggish. If you're looking for something to run like an ipad, save your money, but for the price, this tablet does the job.

I've used other inexpensive tablets and this one is better than most. It comes with Google play which is a big plus. Of course its a bit slow and doesn't have a lot of storage, but for $60 it does everything a friend's $200 tablet does just a bit slower. I would recommend this for someone that is looking for an inexpensive tablet and doesn't mind it being a bit sluggish. If you're looking for something to run like an ipad, save your money, but for the price, this tablet does the job.

Good if you use Opera Mini browser I just bought this Ematic tablet today.  Chrome is too slow.  "Opera Mini" is the fastest browser for this tablet because it condenses websites before downloading them.  You can get Opera Mini from "Play Store".  As long as you use Opera Mini, this tablet is worth the price.

Really do love my Razer Edge Pro I honestly love this tablet. Especially with the controller add on and headphones games become oddly immersive. I have played more games with this tablet than I would have otherwise because it just gives me more opportunity to play games due to it's form factor and portability. Currently I am using it just as a gaming system but it is Windows 8 and clearly runs very well.For games that do not have native controller support do a web search for game controller software and you will find some software that flawlessly replicates keyboard strokes with the controller. You can even use a controller to move the mouse around, right click, left click, anything to do with the keyboard and mouse via the controller. Ultimately, most games only use a limited set of buttons. This will work for a nearly all games out there without native controller support.The screen resolution does not bother me too much, though a higher res would be welcome. The performance in game is decent. You may have to lower quality a bit on some more intensive games but none are what I would describe as unplayable. Mostly you are just missing out on some advanced lighting effects. I do not really have any major complaints in the graphics department, especially for the tablet form factor.Size and weight are good. Not perfect but I have had no issue with it especially propping it up on my lap, etc. Holding it straight up will get a little tiring especially with the controller attachment. The controller attachment is a bit large. Would be better if it could split or fold in half somehow. It is the only thing that gets the offical "pretty bulky" complaint but have found it to be the most enjoyable way of gaming on the Razer Edge Pro.Battery life with the standard battery is pretty dismal. Most times I just leave it plugged in while playing. With headphones, full brightness, and an advanced game it can drain in around an hour. If you are just using this as a tablet things improve but your mileage will vary. To be fair however, any device that does intense 3D gaming will have pretty terrible battery life so overall, this is not shocking. The only annoyance is the plug is on the bottom and if you are sitting with the tablet on your lap it can sometimes unplug. The unit definitely does get hot but it has adequate venting and cooling fans that are not annoying.The TV output and 5.1 audio output worked perfectly with the dock. It is a nice addon but most of the time I just use it as a handheld tablet with the controller attachment.

Great tablet with more than enough speed. Great tablet overall but the accessories are overpriced and if you planned on using a stylus don't bother with this tablet.  Manufacturer says any stylus at a local electronics store will work.  I tried multiple types of stylus' and did not find one that would work for handwriting or drawing on this tablet.

Modern day pen and pad, and so much more I took the plunge on a refurbished Note 8 and couldn't be happier. I have owned many pen devices over the years, from the original Compaq iPaq, IBM Wacom based Thinkpads, and the original Galaxy Note phone. I'm going to start this review by saying don't buy this tablet if you don't want a pen based device... there are cheaper options that will fill the tablet role without the added cost of the Wacom pen. If you are still reading, I'll assume you want a device with a real pen.The Note 8 is the perfect size for a note taking device. The Galaxy Note I phone I own and love just wasn't big enough to make the pen really useful for me. The design of the tablet is simple, with gently curved corners and a fairly wide bezel. The lack of an easily removable back provides decent rigidity that makes it feel less creaky than my phone. The back can be removed for a fairly easy battery replacement... but it is not meant to be swapped in and out like a phone battery.  I wish Samsung didn't put the big chrome logo on top, but it is what it is.The pen is slightly longer and fatter than the pen that comes with the Note phones. It is mostly round, with a flat side where the button is. The tip of the pen has a nice texture which adds some drag when used on the glass. The nib is not replaceable with standard Wacom nibs. I personally use a Wacom pen that I purchased for my laptop. It has the eraser on one end and replaceable nibs. It is the size of a standard pen, and obviously won't fit in the tablets pen holder. I find it much nicer to write with than the provided pen.From an inking perspective, the pen is accurate for me. I'm left handed and I don't have any issues with the alignment of the nib and on-screen cursor position. There is some minor lag if you are drawing fast where you may notice the ink takes a fraction of a second to catch up. It's not horrible, but may be noticeable and annoying if you are expecting the device to be just like ink and paper. In truth, it's pretty fast compared to other Wacom devices I've used. I *always* put a screen protector on my pen devices... while the glass is durable, all it takes is a small grain to get caught on your tip or eraser to make a scratch. I am using the iSmooth Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Ultra Clear Premium HD Screen Protector 2 Pack which is working out well.If you are looking for a case, check out the MoKo Slim Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch GT - N5100 Android Tablet, Black (with lip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty. It fits well and the brown leather looks nice in contrast to the white tablet. There is some talk about the magnets in many of the cases interfering with the s-pen, possibly even causing permanent problems, so I took an exacto knife and carefully removed them from the case.On the application side, S-Note is where the Note 8 makes the S-Pen shine. It does everything you would expect a note taking app to do, including the ability to export notes to a pdf for sharing with non S-Note users. The only thing missing for me feature in Microsoft One Note where it translates your ink in the background and makes your handwritten notes searchable.From a general perspective of tablet use, the Note 8 works fine. The lcd is sharp and has great viewing angles. Video playback is smooth and the device feels very snappy in general. I appreciate that Samsung still provides a micro sd slot... it is becoming too rare these days. As is normal for Samsung, they add in their usual bloatware apps that can't be removed. While you can root the Galaxy Note 8, if you install an Android rom like Cyanogenmod you will loose the ability to run S-Note and many of the other tightly integrated s-pen features. Samsung tends to be stingy with their OS updates, and I'll be surprised if they support the device after 4.4 Kitkat. The battery is good, but not stellar. Be careful with apps that provide background notifications/updates as they will chew away at your battery when the tablet is idle.In summary, the Note 8 is almost perfect for me. If Microsoft released a fully functional version of One Note for Android I would be in heaven, but it will never happen. The Surface Pro is just too big and expensive for what I need. At the current price, the refurbished Note 8 is about the same price as a good new 7" tablet without a pen, which seems like a great deal to me.

Disappointed I was excited to get this gift for my husband.  He  absolutely loved it until the glitching started.  You will be lucky to use this device for 15 minutes without it shutting down and rebooting.  So annoying. ....especially when you're in the middle of something important.  Will be returning

Surprisingly decent budget tablet I got one of these for a friend, someone who I know isn't going to be picky about hardware specs and speed. There are a lot of entry-level Android tablets out there now, some of which are sub-$100 models. You can actually get this one in that price range if you find it on sale, but what sets it apart from a lot of others is it's actually not half bad.On that note, a word of warning- most if not all other tablets in this price range are little more than child's toys. They tend to have very weak hardware that can barely handle Angry Birds and will lag seriously if you try to stream video. Furthermore the build quality is shoddy- they use cheap plastic and glass that affords poor viewing angle, has bad glare in bright light, and is very easy to scratch or break.The main reason I even gave this consideration is it's made by Asus. I've used Asus hardware for a very long time- everything ranging from motherboards to graphics cards, monitors, laptops, routers, and most recently the Nexus 7. Generally speaking, their hardware is very solid in terms of performance and reliability. In fact I can't think of a single time I've been disappointed by one of their products. I figured even if this tablet was suspiciously cheap, it was probably at least decent. And it is.First, expectations. This is not an iPad and you aren't paying $500+ for it. If you expect it to perform like an iPad, you WILL be disappointed. It's also half the price of the similar-sized Nexus 7 and of course not as nice. But for what you pay for, it's surprisingly good. Particularly, it has these pro points:-- A lot of internal storage (16 GB), twice the Nexus 7 base model and as much as the Kindle Fire HD base model.-- It is an Android 4.1 Jellybean tablet. Most tablets in this price range are 2.3 or 4.0-- It has a micro-SD slot, which is very noteworthy. Many significantly more expensive tablets, including the Nexus 7, do not have one (the cheapest decent one I know of is the Galaxy Tab 2 7, which is about $70 more).-- Pretty decent hardware and chipset- it's comparable to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7. I at first thought the VIA chipset would be considerably slower, but it's actually so similar as makes no difference. It's robust enough to run some pretty heavyweight apps, and can stream HD flawlessly.-- Light weight, solid build. The tablet has a rubberized back that feels rugged and affords good grip. It is about the same size and weight as the Nexus 7.-- Good battery life. It lasts about as long as its more expensive cousins, especially if you don't use 'performance mode.'-- Comes with an AC adapter. Might not seem a plus, but these days a lot of electronics don't include one, which can be a pain.I suspect a lot of the complaints I've seen about apps and performance have to do with teething bugs. When a new device is released, this is pretty normal- a few updates usually fixes it. I've seen little in the way of these problems so far. That said, there are of course some downsides to this tablet:-- The display is average at best. Touch controls work fine, resolution is not bad, but the viewing angle is very noticeably more narrow than a lot of higher priced tablets (not terribad though, like the Dell Streak 7). It also seems to suffer more from glare, possibly because the backlight doesn't seem to be that powerful even on full brightness. It's by no means unworkable but if you're not looking straight at the screen or if you're viewing it in bright light, it's harder to make out detail.-- As with the Nexus 7, the speaker (note singular) on this tablet is pretty mediocre. You'll want headphones if you listen to music or stream videos. It works fine for things like Skype though.-- Ditto with the camera, which is essentially just a webcam. Unlike the pretty decent cameras on the Galaxy Tab 2, you're definitely not going to be using this to take pictures.-- No bluetooth. This is probably the biggest minus as far as feature set goes, and though the virtual keyboard is well done, it's still not great for things like email. This also means there's no wireless file transfer, though the SD slot and cloud storage mitigates that.-- Some apps are apparently still incompatible at this writing, notably Instagram 4.0 (however, I was able to sideload 3.5). I don't expect this to remain an issue for long.Overall, I would say this is a solid tablet considering what you're paying for it. I will also note though that you can 'fix' pretty much all of those cons by paying $60-70 more for a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Still, for a device that you can get for as low as $80 on sale, this is a surprisingly good performer. It's practical, inexpensive enough to gift, and doesn't cost so much that you'll be scared to use it.Edit: 8/9/2013- just to add a few extra points in the MeMO Pad's favor:-- This thing actually supports USB on the go. I was frankly amazed by this since a lot of much more expensive tablets and phones do not (including the KFHD). I've tried flash drives and a voice recorder; both work perfectly (you'll probably need a 3rd party cable for this).-- The battery life on standby is pretty good. I've let it sit for 2 weeks with minimal use (wifi and sync on) and it still has about 1/4 charge. Not bad.I've noticed that the 1st gen Nexus 7 has received a massive price drop (probably due to the release of the 2nd gen) that makes it much more competitive. The MeMO pad is definitely still the choice if you're on a budget though.

Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix. One day, it stopped working. I could open the app, select a video and start it, but I would get an error message and no video would come up.I tried all kinds of fixes from hard reboot of device, reboot router and so forth. Nothing. Well, after a couple weeks of frustration, I got it fixed.Go to:SettingsApplicationsManage All ApplicationsScroll down and select NetflixSelect "Clear Cache" (Data will change to 12.00KB)Select "Clear Data" (Window will pop up and ask Clear Application Data? Choose "Clear Data")Return to Kindle Home page (Little white house icon at lower right)Open Netflix appSign back in to NetflixOpen a show or movieIt should work again with no error messageEnjoyLatest **UPDATES** on 2 DEC 2013 (Download Prime Videos & Audio updated: Added new category - Apps)I upgraded from the original Kindle Fire. If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the "Add To Cart" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as "Under the Dome" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under "Prime Instant Video" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under "For the Kids" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, "Genres."  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these "unlimited" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play

Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix. One day, it stopped working. I could open the app, select a video and start it, but I would get an error message and no video would come up.I tried all kinds of fixes from hard reboot of device, reboot router and so forth. Nothing. Well, after a couple weeks of frustration, I got it fixed.Go to:SettingsApplicationsManage All ApplicationsScroll down and select NetflixSelect "Clear Cache" (Data will change to 12.00KB)Select "Clear Data" (Window will pop up and ask Clear Application Data? Choose "Clear Data")Return to Kindle Home page (Little white house icon at lower right)Open Netflix appSign back in to NetflixOpen a show or movieIt should work again with no error messageEnjoyLatest **UPDATES** on 2 DEC 2013 (Download Prime Videos & Audio updated: Added new category - Apps)I upgraded from the original Kindle Fire. If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the "Add To Cart" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as "Under the Dome" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under "Prime Instant Video" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under "For the Kids" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, "Genres."  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these "unlimited" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play

Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their "Learn More" link with the following info:"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.""As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy."If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download "Casablanca" but not able to download "The Avengers" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" vs. 7.6" x 5.4" x 0.4"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special "reading mode" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The "Recommended for you" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule "Quiet Time" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9" x 4.5" x 0.34" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87" x 5.3" x 0.29" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1" x 6.2" x 0.31" vs. 9.4" x 6.4" x 0.35"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special "reading mode" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The "Recommended for you" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule "Quiet Time" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download "Casablanca" but not able to download "The Avengers" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7", and the Nexus is 10". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy."It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1" x 6.2" x 0.31" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4" x 6.6" x 0.29" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.

Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix. One day, it stopped working. I could open the app, select a video and start it, but I would get an error message and no video would come up.I tried all kinds of fixes from hard reboot of device, reboot router and so forth. Nothing. Well, after a couple weeks of frustration, I got it fixed.Go to:SettingsApplicationsManage All ApplicationsScroll down and select NetflixSelect "Clear Cache" (Data will change to 12.00KB)Select "Clear Data" (Window will pop up and ask Clear Application Data? Choose "Clear Data")Return to Kindle Home page (Little white house icon at lower right)Open Netflix appSign back in to NetflixOpen a show or movieIt should work again with no error messageEnjoyLatest **UPDATES** on 2 DEC 2013 (Download Prime Videos & Audio updated: Added new category - Apps)I upgraded from the original Kindle Fire. If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the "Add To Cart" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as "Under the Dome" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under "Prime Instant Video" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under "For the Kids" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, "Genres."  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these "unlimited" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play

poor support my unit came with an installed calendar, which was advertized as being able to synch with my outlook calendar on my laptop. when it would not work  I tried manually entering data. even that would not work.  i went to the direct personal support system. they were unable to provide a solution and after a long delay they gave up. I eventually downloaded another calender system which , while not able to synch at least I was able to input data.

Kindle Fire HDX 7"... Faster, smoother and better than earlier versions Each generation of the Kindle Fire 7" tablet gets better than the previous iteration, and this one is no exception. It is not revolutionary, the way that the 1st generation Kindle Fire was when it was introduced in September 2011, but it's a great example of good product evolution.Picked up the Kindle Fire HDX 7" during one of the December promotions after seeing the 'Try Risk Free' sidebars on the product page. Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:? Likes:+ Excellent 7" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 "Mojito"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10? ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences? On the Fence: Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to? Dislikes:- None encountered? Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10? ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.? In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 "Mojito" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.? Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.? Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.? Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.? Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW ? 12/31/2013

Likes:+ Excellent 7" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 "Mojito"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10? ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences? On the Fence: Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to? Dislikes:- None encountered? Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10? ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.? In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 "Mojito" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.? Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.? Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.? Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.? Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW ? 12/31/2013

I wish I had this first! It is everything I always wanted in a tablet! Had I seen this first, I never would have purchased the other 4 that are now gathering dust.

Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their "Learn More" link with the following info:"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.""As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy."If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download "Casablanca" but not able to download "The Avengers" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" vs. 7.6" x 5.4" x 0.4"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special "reading mode" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The "Recommended for you" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule "Quiet Time" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9" x 4.5" x 0.34" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87" x 5.3" x 0.29" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

Very Good Tablet....But No GPS and Limited Apps SUMMARY - Overall, I really like the Kindle Fire HDX. It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3" x 5.0" x .35", it's one of the smallest 7" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like "Books"  "Music"  "Videos"  and "Web."  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that "special offers" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled "oops." As in "Oops, there aren't very many of them." Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think "10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty." Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say "previous" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new "Mayday" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By "one hand" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine. But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.

Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix. One day, it stopped working. I could open the app, select a video and start it, but I would get an error message and no video would come up.I tried all kinds of fixes from hard reboot of device, reboot router and so forth. Nothing. Well, after a couple weeks of frustration, I got it fixed.Go to:SettingsApplicationsManage All ApplicationsScroll down and select NetflixSelect "Clear Cache" (Data will change to 12.00KB)Select "Clear Data" (Window will pop up and ask Clear Application Data? Choose "Clear Data")Return to Kindle Home page (Little white house icon at lower right)Open Netflix appSign back in to NetflixOpen a show or movieIt should work again with no error messageEnjoyLatest **UPDATES** on 2 DEC 2013 (Download Prime Videos & Audio updated: Added new category - Apps)I upgraded from the original Kindle Fire. If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the "Add To Cart" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as "Under the Dome" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under "Prime Instant Video" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under "For the Kids" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, "Genres."  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these "unlimited" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play

The Fire 8.9 HDX exceeded my expectations and equals or beats the Ipad Air in many respects at a cheaper price! Love it Amazon I normally do not post reviews as most of the time I am not that impressed with a product to take the time to write about it in detail.  This is the exception The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. I have had all of the previous versions of the kindle fires and thought they were good for movies, books, shopping at Amazon & music along with a few apps that were popular, but they lacked the hardware/spec/polish to be a great internet browser and tablet overall.  I have used the Ipad 1 & 2 in the past and even those older versions surfed the net better than the previous Kindle Fires most of the time.  With the addition of all the apps for Ipads and the straight android market it was tough for the older Fires to compete directly as a top quality tablet.  I never bothered in the past to side load apps as I figured it was difficult and a bother and back then I was just using all the apps I needed on my Samsung Galaxy 3 from the android market.  (More on Side loading apps later on the Fire)NOW...the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 changes everything that I did not like.  I was able to purchase it at Staples with a $50 off coupon and for $329 I received the 16 gb version that now  come with a charging kit.  The old ones did not.  That is a difference of $170 compared to an $499 Ipad Air 16GB.  Even at $379 it is still a saving of $120.First impression was WoW the amazing light weight of the new tablet...Awesome!  Next the screen is amazing.  When I say that, I mean the best I have ever seen on any tablet including the new IPAD Air (more on that direct comparison later).  I was hoping that these 2 improvements would not be the only thing that was upgraded as the software, apps and processor needed to be drastically improved to compete with the other new tablets coming out.The great news is that the silk browser is much improved as well as the whole operating system.Fire HDX 8.9 vs the Ipad Air I tested the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 against my friends new Ipad Air in surfing the internet 1st. Side by Side i would go to various sites on both tablets to see if there was a big difference in speed.  They were both going over wifi and to my surprise the speed was basically the same (really good). Sometimes the kindle was slightly faster and sometime the Ipad was, but it was so negligible in most cases that I would not even notice it if not comparing them side by side.  The great news to me was that the New Kindle was equal to the new Ipad Air in surfing the net which in the past it was not!My next comparison was to look at the screens while surfing and also watching movies.  The Kindle Fire screen was indeed brighter and clearer in both movies and web sites in almost all cases.  The Kindle Fire's screen is slightly smaller, but for watching movies in HD horizontally they were the same size on both devices because the Ipad has the black bars that limit it on I am assuming HD formatted movies. (I could be wrong in that maybe it is not always the case with the formatting).  The Kindle Fire's coloring, brightness and clarity in side by side streaming movies with the Air was just plain and simple better.  In darker scenes you could clearly make out details on the fire that I could not on the the Air. The Fire's screen looked brighter and clear with great colors that just stood out! I tried several scenes in 2 different movies and the result was always in favor of the Kindle Fire.  I was shocked at the advantage as it was quite a bit better. (the Air has a good screen, just not as good as the new fires!)  Also the Kindle with a Prime Membership lets you download some movies/tv shows for viewing offline later.  It is not all movies/tv shows but there is enough for now to keep you occupied for several trips and hopefully they will continue to add more in the future. They let you chose the standard size or 720 or 1080 but each step up takes up more room on your tablet and takes longer to download.  I have also heard that some have time limits as to how long you can have them downloaded but I have not yet experienced that with the shows I have downloads. (one negative is they do not tell you which movies are downloadable??? So you have no way of knowing until you click on it. Hopefully they will add that to the search option in the future in Prime)  I just also want to mention IMDb for movies is something I thought I wouldn't use much, but I am really starting to like it. It tells you all about any actors on screen and also add's trivia about the movie or scene.  It makes me want to rewatch older classic movies just to learn more about them!Ok, so far the Fire is lighter in weight, with a better screen and the speed when surfing the net was equal!  I am really impressed so far.  Now comes the area that bothered me in the past and almost had me going for an Ipad Air..lack of Apps in the closed off Amazon market.  Now do not get me wrong Amazon has a ton of popular Apps that I am guessing would satisfy 75% of the people who would consider buying a Kindle Fire in the 1st place.  They have all the popular games and apps that most people use.  But they also do not have some that Google and Apple do provide.  For example Amazon had my CBS sports fantasy Football app, but did not have ESPN's fantasy football app. along with Direct TV Sunday ticket! This drove me crazy as I wanted both on my new amazing Fire screen!  So I decided to try to side-load these into the Kindle and they worked! I will not go into that process, but It was relatively easy to do in just a few steps.  This process gives me access to most/all of the android apps!!!  This is a great way to get all the apps you might not find in the amazon Apps store.  I will always use Amazon apps 1st (since they approve them), but then sideload ones they do not have in their store.  This really solves one of the biggest complaints you will hear about the Kindle Fire from techie/experts!  It may take a little work at first to figure out how to sideload the apps, but once you do it is a pretty simple task.Lastly, I just received the OS update 3.1 for the fire and it added Goodreads and also Collections to the Fire.  It added more improvements but I did not have a chance to use the others to this point.  Goodreads is great if you like reading and seeing what others recommend or are reading!  Collections lets you add Books or Apps into Groups which makes it much easier to find things on your tablet.  The apps collections can go right on the Home Screen of the Kindle which is a nice touch that other tablets already maybe have (apple?).  There are other improvements that I will try to come back and update at a later time when I have a chance to use them.In summarizing the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9- It has surpassed my expectations period.  I find it can go side by side with the new Ipad Air in almost every respect and even beat it in screen quality, weight and price $170 less!!!!  You can almost buy the smaller HDX 7inch for that if you catch a sale.  I cannot recommend the 8.9 enough as I am for the 1st time really impressed with the whole package.  It can do everything well and has the screen, processor, OS and price that puts it ahead or at least equal to the new IPAD air.  Amazon with Prime & the HDX 8.9 is a killer combination of great Hardware/Software/2 day free shipping/Apps/Games and finally Great Amazon Support!  The Mayday Button (Help) is amazing. I am pretty good at using technology and I used it a few times to help change a few settings on the tablet instead of searching  for the settings.  The customer service rep. was online in a video box on my table in 20 seconds and help me find the settings quickly.  Another amazing aspect of this tablet is that it is great for novices as well as people who like technology and want to try to sideload apps for example.  I just do not see anything on the market at this price with this many great and unique features that comes close to comparing to the HDX 8.9 Fire.
